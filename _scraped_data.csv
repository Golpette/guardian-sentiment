0,"The confirmed death toll from the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi has risen to and the vice-president, Jusuf Kalla, has warned it could reach into the thousands. More than aftershocks followed the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit Sulawesi on Friday, causing thousands of homes, hotels, shopping malls and several mosques to collapse. Of the fatalities, were in the city of Palu, with casualties so far recorded in Donggala, the worst-hit area, which is home to people. Hundreds of bodies have been found on beaches and authorities fear many may have been washed out to sea. Speaking at a press conference, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the BNBP disaster agency, said the area affected was much bigger than originally thought. “The deaths are believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached,” said Sutopo, emphasising that access to Donggala, as well as the towns of Sigi and Boutong, was very limited so the final death toll was impossible to predict. The city of Palu has been completely devastated by the earthquake and tsunami waves, which reached as high as six metres in some areas. In the city, partially covered bodies lay near the shore and survivors sifted through a tangled mess of corrugated steel roofing, timber, rubble and flotsam. One man was seen carrying the muddy corpse of a small child. “Many corpses are scattered on the beach and floating on the surface of the sea,” one local resident, Nining, told local media. The identified bodies are being buried in mass graves, Sutopo said. Sutopo confirmed there was no electricity in Palu and Donggala, while drinking water and fuel were running out. There was limited access to heavy equipment needed to help rescue efforts, so the search for people trapped in the rubble was mostly being carried out by hand. Rescue efforts are continuing for dozens of people still trapped in the collapsed ruins of the eight-storey Roa Roa hotel in Palu, with voices heard screaming from the wreckage. A woman was found alive during the evening in the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, according to the National Search and Rescue Agency, which released photos of the her lying on a stretcher covered in a blanket. There were concerns about the whereabouts of hundreds of people preparing for a beach festival that had been due to start on Friday, a spokesman for the BNBP said. Aerial footage shows tsunami destruction in Sulawesi – in pictures At least people had been badly injured, the agency said, as hospitals struggled to cope with the influx of casualties, setting up open-air clinics to treat the injured. Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu army hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the continuing strong aftershocks. Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter. “There was no time to save ourselves. I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” said Haris, adding that his family was in town for a wedding. “I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence. I don’t know what happened to her and my child. I hope they are safe.” The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, who visited the region on Sunday, said earlier the military was being called to the region to help search-and-rescue teams. Aerial footage shows tsunami destruction in Sulawesi – in pictures One of the first casualties of the earthquake, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, is being hailed a hero after he stayed in the air traffic control tower as the earthquake hit, to make sure that a flight to Bali could take off safely. Agung then jumped from the control tower as it was collapsing, but did not survive the fall. Many residents slept in makeshift shelters, terrified that the powerful aftershocks could topple their damaged homes. Some voiced criticism of the agency that lifted the tsunami warning . The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to “end” the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, about miles from Palu. “We have no observation data at Palu. So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that,” said Rahmat Triyono, the head of the earthquakes and tsunami centre at BMKG. He said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in the sea level, only recorded an “insignificant” wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu. We have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying Jan Gelfand, Red Cross The tsunami was triggered by a strong quake that brought down buildings and sent locals fleeing for higher ground as a churning wall of water crashed into Palu. “We all panicked and ran out of the house” when the quake hit, said Anser Bachmid, a Palu resident. “People here need aid – food, drink, clean water.” Dramatic video footage captured from the top floor of a parking ramp in Palu, nearly miles from the quake epicentre, showed waves bring down several buildings and inundate a large mosque. About people have been evacuated, the BNBP said. “This was a terrifying double disaster,” said Jan Gelfand, a Jakarta-based official at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “We have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying. There are more than people living there. This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.” Friday tremor was also felt in the far south of the island in its largest city Makassar and on neighbouring Kalimantan, Indonesia portion of Borneo island. The initial quake struck as evening prayers were about to begin in the world biggest Muslim-majority country on the holiest day of the week, when mosques are especially busy. Indonesia is one of the most disaster-prone nations on earth. It lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, where tectonic plates collide and many of the world volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur. Earlier this year, a series of powerful quakes hit Lombok, killing more than people on the holiday island and neighbouring Sumbawa. Indonesia has been hit by a string of other deadly quakes including a devastating tremor that struck off the coast of Sumatra in December That Boxing Day quake triggered a tsunami that killed throughout the region, including in Indonesia.",1078,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/indonesia-tsunami-cries-for-help-from-rubble-amid-fears-thousands-dead
1,"On Friday evening, Palu Talise beach had been heaving with people, gathered joyfully for the opening of the city Nomini music festival. But by Saturday morning, in the devastating aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that hit Sulawesi, the beach was strewn with bodies. Corpses could be seen floating in the sea. “Along the Palu coast, houses were swept away by the tsunami, including my house in Tondo, lost completely to the tsunami. Bodies are everywhere,” said Ical, a local journalist. The full extent of the damage done by the earthquake, the subsequent tsunami and aftershocks, is still unknown. The city of Palu, which was the focal point of most rescue efforts on Sunday, was strewn with debris but a lack of heavy equipment obstructed efforts to find survivors in the rubble, with rescuers just using their hands. The city is built around a narrow bay which it is believed may have intensified the force of the tsunami waters as they hit. Visible among the wreckage was a bridge broken in half, a mosque submerged in water, its turret and dome collapsed inwards, and a shopping mall reduced to a crumpled wreck. “It is believed there are still people trapped in the mall,” said a reporter from the Indonesian news outlet MetroTV. “I can smell the very strong odour of decaying bodies.” Rescuers spent the day attempting to rescue survivors who were heard screaming from the wreckage of Palu collapsed eight-storey Roa Roa hotel. Six people were pulled out alive but dozens are still trapped. “There are people under the rubble of the building. Heavy equipment is needed for evacuation,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the BNBP disaster agency. Muhammad Syaugi, head of the national search and rescue team, said that heavy equipment was on the way. “We are trying our best. Time is so important here to save people,” he added. Most bodies recovered in Palu were brought to a police hospital, where they began stacking up quickly, and by midday on Sunday, corpses were laid out in the courtyard under the baking sun. People desperately looking for relatives walked among the bodies, trying to identify faces. Among them was Baharuddin, who was searching for his son. “I have one child, he missing,” he said. “I last spoke to him before he went to school in the morning.” Sutopo said once identified, the bodies would be buried in mass graves immediately to stop the spread of disease, but would be “buried properly” later. The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday to inspect the damage. “There are many challenges,” Jokowi said to reporters. “We have to do many things soon, but conditions do not allow us to do so.” While the death toll sits at this barely accounts for the worst hit area, the city of Donggala, where people live and rescue teams are still struggling to reach. Rafiq Anshori, a spokesperson for the Red Cross on the ground in Palu, said he and his team had spent the day collecting bodies from the beach and outside buildings. He described the scenes the Red Cross team were encountering as “much worse than the earthquake in Lombok” – referring to the recent earthquake on the Indonesian island – and said most roads were cracked, making access difficult. He estimated around of buildings in Palu were destroyed. Tens of thousands of residents who escaped were in temporary shelters, many desperately trying to locate friends and relatives. “The ground rose up like a spine and suddenly fell,” said Palu resident Nur Indah through tears. “Many people were trapped and buried under collapsed houses. I could do nothing to help. In the evening, some of them turned on their cellphones just to give a sign that they were there. But the lights were off later and the next day.” Over people have been injured and many taken to makeshift outdoor clinics, as hospitals were unable to cope under the increasing pressure. Sitting outside the army hospital, Dwi Haris said he had only been in Palu for a wedding. Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter. “There was no time to save ourselves. I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” said Haris, who had suffered a broken back and shoulder. “I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence. I don’t know what happened to her and my child. I hope they are safe.”",755,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/bodies-everywhere-indonesia-rescue-efforts-focus-on-palu
2,"The homecoming of Brazil far-right presidential frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro from hospital was upstaged this weekend by huge demonstrations as concerns over his authoritarian tendencies grew. Bolsonaro flew from São Paulo to his home in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday, three weeks after being stabbed during campaigning , while tens of thousands of women filled the streets in cities across Brazil to protest against his extremist positions ahead of the October election. The news site reported anti-Bolsonaro protests in all Brazil states grew out of a Facebook group called Women United Against Bolsonaro which nearly million people have joined. Pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations took place in states, the site said. The piauí magazine website called the demonstrations “historic” and printed a photo of an enormous crowd in São Paulo which organisers claimed half a million attended, though police did not provide an estimate. In Rio the huge crowds that filled the city centre were notable for their diversity – with women of all ages, many of whom had brought children, male and LGBT demonstrators, chanting “not him”, an anti-Bolsonaro hashtag that has become a campaign slogan shared by celebrities like Madonna. Trump of the tropics: the 'dangerous' candidate leading Brazil presidential race Many demonstrators expressed concerns over Bolsonaro declaration in a television interview on Friday that he would not accept any election result he did not win because of his endorsement of the military dictatorship which ran Brazil for two decades. Flavia Carvalho, a civil servant, carried a “not him” banner designed around an Adolf Hitler cartoon. “He is preaching fascism,” she said. Others said they were protesting against the sexist, racist and homophobic views Bolsonaro has expressed. “He is sexist. He is misogynist. He is racist,” said Ana Paulo Gonçalves, a teacher. “He wants to go back to the military dictatorship,” said her sister Christine, a designer. Bolsonaro, a former army captain and veteran lawmaker, currently leads polling for a first-round vote on October. Running second is Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of São Paulo who took the place of formidably popular former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after Lula candidacy was barred because he is serving a prison sentence for graft. Bolsonaro and Haddad are expected to face off in a run-off vote on October. Making adept use of WhatsApp and social media, Bolsonaro has built support across Brazil, attacking Lula Workers’ party for its involvement in a huge graft scheme and espousing a hardline approach to law and order. His views have resonated with Brazilians angry and fearful over endemic corruption and rising violent crime. Supporters stage drive-by demonstrations, racing through towns across Brazil in convoys of cars and motorbikes, waving flags and blasting horns. The divisions Bolsonaro provokes in Brazil were evident in a video of him boarding Saturday flight from São Paulo. While some passengers regaled him with chants of “legend”, others yelled “fascist” and “not him”. Journey to Brazil heart: across miles and seven states, we ask – how will Brazilians vote? In a television interview broadcast on Friday, Bolsonaro suggested Brazil armed forces could intervene if his main rivals, the leftist Workers’ party, “committed a foul” in the election. “I don’t accept an election that is not me being elected,” Bolsonaro told reporter José Datena, adding that Brazil electronic voting system could be defrauded by the Workers’ party, but providing no evidence. Bolsonaro enjoys widespread support among police and the military. His vice-presidential candidate, Gen Hamilton Mourão, unnerved Brazilians recently when he said in a situation of “anarchy”, a president could declare an “auto-coup”. Both men praise the military dictatorship that ran Brazil from torturing and executing opponents. “I lived [during] this phase,” said Maria do Carmo, who was protesting in Rio and saw relatives imprisoned by the military regime. “It was terrible.” On Sunday, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper called on both leading candidates to make a commitment to democracy, accusing Bolsonaro of “stimulating paranoias of manipulation” and criticising the Workers’ party for its attacks on the justice system for Lula imprisonment it calls politically motivated.",672,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/huge-protests-in-brazil-as-far-right-presidential-hopeful-jair-bolsonaro-returns-home
3,"The last time Renata Souza saw her friend and colleague Marielle Franco, they hugged and kissed and said they’d see each other the following morning. They were scheduled to meet with higher-ups from their political party to finalize Franco as a vice-gubernatorial candidate for the state of Rio de Janeiro. But minutes after they parted, a reporter called Souza to tell her that Franco had been murdered. A breakout star on Rio political scene, Franco was a black woman from one of the city poorest favelas who defied the odds to become the fifth most voted-for councilor in 'I'm waiting for her to come back': Marielle Franco fiancee on life a month after Rio councillor murder She was an outspoken critic of Rio heavy-handed police and had recently become the chair of the committee overseeing the city federally mandated military intervention . Franco and her driver Anderson Gomes died instantly when two men opened fire on their car on March in what police believe was a targeted assassination. No arrests have been made, but as Brazil prepares for legislative elections, Franco legacy can be seen across the country: an unprecedented number of black women have registered to run for office – and many invoke her example on the campaign trail. As well as choosing a new president next Sunday, October, Brazilians will also elect congresspeople, senators and more than state legislators. Although she was a local politician, Franco murder fuelled an urgent conversation about racial and gender representation among Brazil elected officials. While black women are of the population – Brazil largest demographic group – they only hold of seats in congress. This new generation of politicians – often campaigning with the slogan “ Marielle presente ” – hopes to start levelling the playing field. Souza is now running for a seat as a state legislator. “I always thought about being on the frontline myself, but Marielle murder brought a sense of urgency. I hesitated for months, but knew I had to run,” she said. “Now I feel her every single moment – in every flyer I hand out, every speech I give, every conversation, every joke.” Souza and Franco met as teenagers in a college prep course in Maré, the Rio favela where they both grew up. They both won scholarships to one of Rio best private universities and went on to pursue graduate degrees. They became outspoken human rights activists and became involved with a newly founded leftwing party, the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL). After Franco was elected in Souza became her chief of staff. “I feel a responsibility to continue what we’d been building for the years we were activists together,” Souza explained. If elected, she will focus on legislation related to reducing the number of homicides of poor, black residents in Rio periphery. The first bill she hopes to pass would ban police operations during the hours when children are going and coming from school . Ahead of next month election, a group of women launched Black Women Decide, a collective aiming to raise black female candidates’ profiles and present data about the challenges confronting black women in politics. Brazil current congress includes only black women. In the election, of total campaign spending for congressional candidates went towards black women, even though they represented of candidacies. Juliana Marques, a member of the collective, says the dynamics of funding create a vicious cycle, as parties tend to invest most money in incumbent candidates. “The rules of the game are rigged. But we’re the largest portion of the population – for the sake of democracy, we should have lawmakers that are at least somewhat similar to the demographic makeup of the population.” Many voters agree. “Marielle was our voice. It was such a blow to lose her, but I never expected in my lifetime to see so many black women running,” said Martilde Guilhermina, at a rally in Rio, where Souza and other black female candidates were speaking. “Politics is a space where we black women have always been denied access.” Igor Soares, a high school teacher, said: “You don’t need to look far in Brazil to see how diverse it is … I’d like to see politics reflect that more, in order to make Brazil less racist and less machista .” Journey to Brazil heart: across miles and seven states, we ask – how will Brazilians vote? After a recent rally in Rio, Dani Monteiro, a from a Rio favela also running for a seat in the state legislature, said: “Most of the representatives in the state legislature are white men. They can’t even imagine living the reality we live – they don’t live with constant shootings, having to protect your kids from stray bullets. “We don’t yet know the scale of what we’re doing: we’re in the eye of the storm now — but I really think we’re a part of a historic moment in Brazil,” Monteiro said. Franco legacy has reached far beyond Rio: hundreds of kilometers north in the Amazon region, Vivi Reis, who is running to be a deputy in the lower house, also cites Franco as a political inspiration. “Her murder was a way of trying to shut us up, in the most brutal way, but it done the opposite of that. Now we’re screaming louder.”",885,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/brazil-sees-black-female-candidates-surge-after-of-rising-star
4,"The future of Macedonia hung in the balance on Sunday as citizens voted in fewer than expected numbers in a referendum to rename their country seen as decisive for the western orientation of the strategic Balkan state. Macedonian polling stations opened under sunny skies on Sunday for a plebiscite on if the former Yugoslav republic adopts the name North Macedonia and is put on a path to EU and Nato membership. Macedonian vote: 'Either we become North Macedonia or North Korea' Turnout is paramount and, voting early on Sunday, the prime minister, Zoran Zaev, urged people to ignore appeals for a nationwide boycott and participate in a ballot called barely three months after Skopje reached a controversial name change agreement with Greece . “I call on everyone to come out and make this serious decision for the future of our country, for future generations,” he said, casting his ballot in the south-eastern town of Strumica, where he previously served as mayor. But by only minutes before polls closed, it had become clear that much fewer than expected had heeded his appeal. As the state electoral commission announced that just had voted jubilant protesters gathered in front of the parliament. “This is a bad day for Zaev and a wonderful day for Macedonians,” said Martin Dukovski, standing outside the parliament building holding a large red and yellow Macedonian flag. “I am a proud Macedonian. The government has to take back this deal. It has to say ‘no’ to Greece.” No vote has been as historic – or imbued with such sentiment – since the country declared independence in The referendum comes against a backdrop of polarisation, potentially explosive emotion and Russia reportedly stepping up clandestine efforts to dash Macedonia embrace by the west. Working in unison with hardcore nationalists bent on boycotting the vote, Moscow has openly voiced distaste for the deal with Greece. Until the accord announcement in June , Athens had vowed to block its neighbour accession to both the EU and Nato, protesting that – without a geographical qualifier – the name amounted to appropriation of its own cultural heritage and territorial ambitions. Within the borders of the landlocked republic, few issues have been as divisive. Many Macedonians argue that, with their country name also conveying a profound sense of identity, being asked to change it is tantamount to existential annihilation. “My first name is Makedonska,” said a hotel employee as she made her way to a polling station in a local school in central Skopje. “What are they [the Greeks] going to to do? Ask me to change that?” Addressing the UN last week, the republic president, Gjorge Ivanov, described the referendum and the dilemma it posed as “historical suicide”. The former university professor has openly asked his fellow citizens to boycott the vote. Although Zaev social democrat government has described the plebiscite as “consultative”, a low turnout would make it almost impossible to push the name-change deal through parliament, where it must receive overwhelming support if constitutional changes are to be ratified. The nationalist main opposition VMRO-DPMNE party, which has denounced the deal and is vehemently opposed to rewording the republic constitution, would find it much easier to resist ratification if fewer voters than expected backed the accord. The party leader, Hristijan Mickoski, appealed to Macedonians to “listen to their hearts” when they woke up on Sunday. The prospect of securing a majority turnout has been further hampered by an electoral list dramatically trimmed by young people emigrating in search of work. Of the million currently on the voting list, an estimated have moved abroad but according to officials have failed to deregister. In such circumstances, the outcome to great degree will hinge on the participation of Macedonia large ethnic Albanian community, which is – at about – its biggest minority. “We don’t have the emotional baggage of Slav Macedonians over the name issue,” said Petrit Sanagini, an ethnic Albanian, as he went to vote with his wife and baby daughter. “This is a compromise we feel we have to make to move our country forward towards a future of prosperity and security. It a historic day, a very special day. Our hope is that everyone will vote.” More than foreign observers are monitoring the plebiscite. In addition to EU and western officials, the referendum is being watched closely in neighbouring Kosovo, where fierce opposition to the prospect of territorial adjustments with Serbia spurred thousands to take to the streets on Saturday. To the consternation of the multi-ethnic territory Albanian majority, Moscow has backed the idea of land swaps. “We very much want Macedonians to accept this deal and join Nato,” said Albin Kurti, the opposition politician whose self-determination movement, Vetëvendosje, organised the protests. “It will deter Russian ambitions and interference in the region,” he told the Guardian in his Pristina office. “And that could not come at a better time.”",815,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/macedonia-to-vote-on-name-change-and-ending-greek-dispute

1,"Thomas Bjørn refused to contemplate either victory or defeat for Europe in the Ryder Cup . Or so he claimed. What can be said with certainty is that Bjørn, in his wildest dreams, didn’t foresee this demolition job on a United States team afforded such pre-event adulation that one wondered whether Europe should bother turning up. What the French for volte-face? Amid incredible scenes on the outskirts of Paris – with Tommy Fleetwood carried shoulder high by jubilant fans and Francesco Molinari mobbed in a manner once the domain of Italian footballers, not golfers – the true scale of Europe glory was almost forgotten. A to win ranks among their finest of all time. Bjørn – an understated, occasionally surly character – masterminded a marvellous triumph marked by flamboyancy. Europe had even afforded the US a lead after the first session, before a rout ensued. Jim Furyk team lay battered and bruised by close of play. “They outplayed us,” conceded Furyk. “Thomas was a better captain this week. We’ve got to tip our caps.” Europe regain Ryder Cup against USA – Sunday singles live! Every Ryder Cup has its defining, closing moment. This one was strange, given Europe had already technically reached their magic total of points because of dormie status in ongoing singles matches. Enter Phil Mickelson, the man whose verbal volley at Tom Watson before exiting Gleneagles four years ago triggered all manner of overhauls – and supposed improvements – in the US setup. In Scotland, the margin of European victory was narrower than here. From the tee, Mickelson carved an iron shot into a lake to seal a success for the imperious Molinari. This was likely to be Mickelson final act as a Ryder Cup player. It afforded him an unwanted place in history; match losses is a record on either side. Watson is teetotal, otherwise one presumes he may have raised a glass. Karma and sport are such devilish bedfellows. Molinari five wins from as many matches render him this Ryder Cup standout player. A typically low-key sort, the Italian emerged so brilliantly from his shell over three days in France. “This means so much to me,” said the Open champion. “So much more than majors, more than anything. It hard not to get emotional when you think about the other players, the vice captains, Thomas, the wives. It been an incredible week.” Nobody typified Bjørn immaculate leadership more than Sergio García. There was widespread criticism when the Masters champion was handed a wildcard spot, to a level that visibly jolted the captain. Not only did García perfectly justify his selection, he strode into the record books on Sunday. A singles win over Rickie Fowler means García is now the leading European points winner of all time, his haul of surpassing Nick Faldo. Bjørn isn’t the type, but he would be entitled to call out his earlier detractors. For a brief Sunday afternoon spell, as seemed amazing in the aftermath, there were home concerns. Rory McIlroy fell to a narrow defeat against Justin Thomas and Webb Simpson, surprisingly, saw off Justin Rose. A US comeback to match what Europe produced in Medinah six years ago suddenly wasn’t such a forlorn hope. Yet, when it mattered, Europe players rebounded from the ropesresponded. It was as if the warning signs triggered a fresh, inspired level of performance. Jon Rahm found himself a hole to the good against Tiger Woods on the The Spaniard duly produced two of the shots of his life to leave only for the match. Rahm made no mistake, the scale of his subsequent celebrations conjuring memories of the great Seve Ballesteros. Rahm was briefly reduced to tears when hugged by McIlroy. No sooner had Rahm departed the penultimate hole than Ian Poulter, Mr Ryder Cup, entered. Poulter played the in very similar style to Rahm but watched his birdie attempt slide past the hole. Dustin Johnson, the world breathed again. We should have known Poulter cunning plan; to take centre stage on the final green, in front of thousands of adoring punters. The Englishman pounded his chest in delight after Johnson was defeated. Europe were within touching distance. Poulter, another wildcard, had delivered again. Nobody supplied more proof of Bjørn midas touch than Thorbjørn Olesen. Attention would naturally be directed upon Olesen contribution here, such is his close friendship with Europe captain. When Bjørn left his fellow Dane out for both Saturday sessions, eyebrows were raised. That call proved inspired, like so many. Olesen was the clear underdog against Jordan Spieth but was by the tee and refused to look back. Olesen hammered the three-time major winner, It will be a shock if Olesen doesn’t become a Ryder Cup feature from here on. Paul Casey, excellent on his return to the Ryder Cup fold, secured a valiant half against Brooks Koepka. Strangely, this was the only shared point of the entire event. That Fleetwood ran out of steam was hardly surprising, albeit Tony Finau produced an outstanding putting display in winning Patrick Reed, out of sorts for two days, rallied admirably to defeat Tyrrell Hatton In typifying the fine attitudes with which this Ryder Cup was played, Reed took to self-deprecation in front of crowds who regard him as a pantomime villain before a warm embrace with Hatton. By then, Henrik Stenson had seen off Bubba Watson As Europe partied, Alex Norén and Bryson DeChambeau were in the unenviable position of trying to complete an irrelevant match. Norén didn’t care; he holed from on the last green to win McIlroy delivered the final words perfectly when assessing where it all went right. “The leadership has been great,” said the Northern Irishman. “The rookies have been phenomenal. We have won the Ryder Cup and all contributed points; that validates what Thomas did. He has been incredible.” Whatever mood and energy Bjørn summoned, Europe wish they could bottle it. The continent golfing pulse has never been stronger. Olé, Olé, Olé.",994,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/ryder-cup-2018-europe-win-usa-golf
2,"Ryder Cup Masterful Europe sweep to victory over USA And with that, this hole-by-hole report comes to its natural end. Many congratulations to Europe, the thoroughly deserved victors of the Ryder Cup . Commiserations to the USA team, who gave Europe a rare old fright for a little while back there, pushing them all the way. We’ve been thoroughly entertained by of the world greatest players; here to when we do it all again at Whistling Straits. We’ll see you there for that. And we also hope to see you back here next April for the Masters. Thanks for reading! Thomas Bjorn lifts the Ryder Cup! He allows himself a broad grin as the trophy is hoisted into the air, while his players bounce around in the rhythmic style. He gives the old pot a kiss, then hands it to Sergio, the greatest European scorer of all time. Then it passes along to Paul Casey, Tyrrell Hatton, Tommy Fleetwood, Francesco Molinari, Rory McIlroy, Thorbjorn Olesen, Alex Noren, Ian Poulter, Jon Rahm, Justin Rose and finally Henrik Stenson. Huge cheers as everyone takes their turn to wave the Ryder Cup about! And a real sense that this team looks out for each other, and enjoys each other company. It a glorious denouement to a marvellous week at Le Golf National! Then the USA team file across to shake the hand of every member of the victorious European side, and shuffle off. Europe then take up position on the podium, waiting to lift the trophy and bounce around like champagne-fuelled maniacs. Which is their right after three days of amazing golf. But first, a word from Bjorn, who says he is planning a holiday. “This moment is unbelievable. These guys have been phenomenal. For it to come out this way, I couldn’t have dreamt it any better. I am proud of these We have played some great golfers, a great American team, and a great captain. I am proud as I can be ever.” The losing captain Jim Furyk is up first, and addresses, in turn, the crowd, his team, Thomas Bjorn and Team Europe. “This was the greatest venue, basically the greatest stadium, all of us on both sides could play in. I want to thank you all. I love these guys, I respect them, they ground it out today. They showed a lot of grit, determination and heart. I’d take these guys on my team any day, I love you all man. Thomas, you did an unbelievable job. No matter how much pressure we put on you, you always responded. You deserve it, congratulations!” The ceremony going to take place on the green. It got more of a Champions League final presentation feel about it, the players hanging around informally waiting to get their hands on the trophy, as opposed to the slightly more formal stage, lectern and chairs set-up of yore. To ramp up the end-of-soccer-final feel, the MC for the event is former Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur and France winger David Ginola. Right you are. The closing ceremony takes place in a few minutes. So stick around! So this is how it ended: Europe USA. Comprehensive in the end. But the Americans had Europe worried for a bit back there, huh? McIlroy v Thomas Casey A/S Koepka Rose v Simpson Rahm v Woods Fleetwood v Finau Poulter v Johnson Olesen v Spieth Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren v DeChambeau Final score: Europe USA Noren beats DeChambeau DeChambeau putt is conceded. Which leaves Noren with a to make birdie, halve the hole, and win his match. It unlikely ... but the left-to-right slider goes into the middle of the cup, and seconds later he engulfed by team-mates! As they leap about in glee, even Jordan Spieth, greenside, can’t help but laugh. That might become the defining moment of this Ryder Cup , you know. It was worth waiting for! From the centre of the fairway, DeChambeau pitches his second to inches! That one of the shots of the entire week! That a birdie, and chances are he’ll be getting a half point, because Noren miles from the pin in two. Updated at BST They’re going down the last. Of course they are. DeChambeau needs to win the hole if he to avoid the fate of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, and end the week without making any contribution at all to the USA total. Noren v DeChambeau EUROPE USA Rory speaks! “It incredible. We took a tough loss at Hazeltine a couple of years ago, and that stung, it was my first experience of what it like to be on the other side. None of us want to fee like that on a Sunday afternoon. The players have been great, the rookies have been phenomenal. We’ve stuck to our job. One of the great things is, we’ve all contributed points. Jon Rahm got a point today, Thorbjorn got a point today, I’m delighted for them. And it validates what Thomas has wanted to do. It a culmination of two years’ hard work. He been incredible, in constant contact with all the guys who were in the team and on the periphery. It been a love-in for the last week. One of the great things about Ryder Cups is that you forge friendships that last a lifetime. And I think a few of those friendships have been forged this week.” DeChambeau not smiling any longer when he sends his tee shot at into the water. But he wedges close from the drop zone, and makes the bogey putt. Noren can’t make his par, and there a fair chance this’ll end up going down Think of it as bonus golf. Everyone loves bonus golf. Noren v DeChambeau EUROPE USA A sad but sporting Jim Furyk speaks. And some very classy words too. “I’m proud of these guys, they fought. There was a time when it looked as though we had a chance. We put some heat on Europe in the first five or six matches. We scrapped it out. But hats off to Europe, they played well again. They turned it around, and looks as though they’ll win the session. So hats off to Thomas, he was a great captain, and his team members played very well top to bottom. So congratulations to them. We’ll regroup and move forward. I’m really proud, I love these guys, I’m proud to serve as their captain, and I had five of my closest friends as vice-captains. It was a group effort. You just have to tip your cap, we got outplayed and Thomas was the better captain.” There still one match out on the course. Nobody cares too much about it. Noren just wants to join in the celebrations; a grinning DeChambeau has taken to conducting the crowd as they sing about Sergio. Noren v DeChambeau EUROPE USA Updated at BST EUROPE USA Reed beats Hatton Captain America secures a consolation point for the Americans with birdie on after a lovely tee shot to three feet. He spins round and shushes the crowd, before breaking into a wide smile, applauding the gallery and congratulating Hatton on Europe victory. That was a lovely self-deprecating joke from the Masters champion. Here the snap take on Europe victory! Ryder Cup Masterful Europe sweep to victory over USA Sergio, Europe all-time number-one Ryder Cup scorer, speaks! “I don’t usually cry but today I can’t help it. It been a rough year. So thankful for Thomas to pick me and believe in me. I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back. It about the team., and I’m happy I was able to help. It was one of those years when nothing seemed to happen. But I’ve never had so many big cheers as I’ve had this week. They had a hell of a team, but it shows how good we are too.” Europe USA Sergio beats Fowler The pair share in par ... and the resulting point means Sergio Garcia has won more points than anybody else in Ryder Cup history! His haul of beats Sir Nick Faldo by ½. Updated at BST Europe USA Stenson beats Watson He closes out his match, halving in birdie. He congratulated by Bubba and Webb Simpson, and then is handed a cup of rosé champagne. He deserves to drain that, but he can’t because someone sprays him in the face with another bottle! Marvellous scenes! Now ... you can say that someone sending a shot into water is a bit anti-climactic compared to a winning putt. And you may have a point. But consider: Molinari registered the winning point ... and in doing so, becomes the first European in Ryder Cup history to win five out of five points! He shakes off the sticky booze and speaks: “This means so much more than majors. It hard not to get emotional, it been an incredible week. They had the strongest team ever, it so good!” Updated at BST EUROPE WIN THE RYDER CUP!!! Europe USA Molinari sends his tee shot at pin high, feet away. Mickelson, the USA on the edge, dunks his tee shot in the water! And he offers his hand to Molinari, who wins the match He immediately drowned in champagne. What an end to the year for the Open champion! Updated at BST Europe will win the Ryder Cup! Nothing official yet, because the matches have to be completed before the points are registered. But they only need one more point. And Molinari-Mickelson is dormie three, Stenson-Watson is dormie five, and Sergio has just won after Fowler found more water; he dormie two. It done, but not yet dusted. Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren v DeChambeau EUROPE USA Europe USA Poulter beats Johnson Johnson nearly drains his long birdie putt, but it shaves by the hole, and Dustin doesn’t want to see Poulter putt. He shakes the Ryder Cup living legend hand, and the Postman delivers a precious point. Europe are on the brink of reclaiming the Ryder Cup! Updated at BST Sergio can’t make his putt. Hole to Fowler, who sliced into water off the tee. What a business. Oh Sergio! Meanwhile DJ wedge into only just makes it over the water. He got an uphill putt over a ridge from feet. Poulter meanwhile eases a stunning wedge to feet. The grandstand at erupts accordingly. And on Bubba makes a street-fighting par, but it a half, and Stenson is dormie five. Poulter v Johnson Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren A/S DeChambeau EUROPE USA Fowler drops by the water at and sends his third not particularly close. Sergio sends his fourth to feet from the drop zone. Rickie nearly drains his long par putt; the pressure, ludicrously, is on Sergio to make a putt to salvage a half. Meanwhile Stenson is on in two, with Bubba in a little trouble. What this, though? Fowler had found water off the tee at ... and now Sergio sends a weak approach into the briny, letting his opponent back into the hole, and maybe the match. Oh Sergio! That is absurd ! Speaking of absurd ... Poulter outdrives DJ on Both in prime position though. Nope! The tension gets to the very best of them. Poulter short one horseshoes out. They’ll go up though at least Poulter can’t lose. Meanwhile Bubba is in awful trouble all the way up handing yet another hole to Stenson; Hatton birdies to cut Reed lead to two holes; and Molinari birdies the par-five to move three up on Mickelson, whose brief mid-round revival looks to have been for nothing. Poulter v Johnson Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren A/S DeChambeau EUROPE USA DJ pulls his lob wedge out. He also removes the flagstick. But his dinky little chip is never likely to drop. It slips to the right, and that a par. Which leaves Poulter with a putt to win the match from seven feet. He prowls around it awhile. Is the Postman about to deliver yet another point? It beginning to slip away from the USA. Fowler sends his tee shot at into the drink down the right. He really up against it now, with the noggin gone. Can DJ pull something out of the bag at Spanish players and the Ryder Cup , eh? Rahm allows himself a tear of joy; his victory means every single European has contributed a point. Nothing for poor old Tiger. What a difference a week makes. Meanwhile on DJ sends his drive into the thick rough. He can only send his second through the back, unable to get any control. Poulter is on in two, with a decent birdie opportunity. And a hole won by Sergio ... or rather lost by Fowler, who hacked his way up Whisper it, but it beginning to look a whole lot better for Europe now. They just need two points to reclaim the cup, and they’re up in four matches and level in another. Poulter v Johnson Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren A/S DeChambeau EUROPE USA Updated at BST Europe USA Rahm beats Woods Tiger nearly trundles in a chip from off the front of the green, but DJ just used up the USA miracle. It flies four feet past, and Rahm makes his birdie putt to seal the deal! What an amazing hole of golf he just played: a monster drive, a delicious chip, and a firm putt into the centre of the cup! And all that after a miserable short one missed on the previous green! Oh this is totally outrageous by Dustin Johnson! Having conceded the to go two down, he left himself a for birdie on the par-three And for the second time today, he drained a monster! Poulter must wonder what on earth is going on! He now left with a for a half ... and he leaves it out left. Just the one hole in that again! Rahm v Woods Poulter v Johnson Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren A/S DeChambeau EUROPE USA Tiger drive at flies into the deep stuff down the left. Rahm blooters a massive, tee shot down the middle ... and it could be enough to close out this game, because while Tiger can only smash out of the rough towards the front of the green, Rahm is able to wedge pin high to six feet!

3,"En Avant As if a Ryder Cup opening wasn’t scary enough, water lies all the way down the left-hand side, as can be particularly tricky depending on wind speed and direction. An iron or fairway wood off the tee will leave a mid-iron into a green guarded by water and two bunkers. L’Apontage More water is in play to the left of the par-three. Prevailing wind is behind, meaning it is hard to stop the ball on the green. Finding the putting surface on the right is the safest play. Le Mérantais Extended in the first par five is reachable in two with an accurate drive to the left side of the fairway. A large tree and bunker guard each side of the green, although the generous sand trap won’t present many problems for Ryder Cup players. Châteaufort New fairway bunkers mean players will need to produce a long and straight tee shot to set up the uphill approach to an elevated green, which is full of slopes. A long par four and one of the toughest holes on the course. Plein Gaz There is potential for welcome respite on this short par four. Three fairway bunkers guard the corner of a short right dogleg and more lies sand in front of a green which narrows at the back but this presents a chance to be aggressive. Maïs ou Colza One of several holes without a bunker, the short sixth is a good birdie opportunity with the biggest difficulty coming in judging the distance of the approach to a green below the level of the fairway. Expect players to use an iron from the tee, followed by a wedge. Le Dromadaire A dogleg right which features a tee shot played to a blind, elevated section of a two-part fairway, followed by a tricky approach to the long green which starts narrow but widens dramatically. Out of bounds awaits a wild drive to the right. Le Green Keeper A solitary, albeit deep, bunker guards the front of the large green on this par three, where judging the wind is a common difficulty, as is keeping the ball on a seriously sloping green from a tee shot requiring a long iron. Vent Debout Unlike the reaching this par five in two will be impossible for all-but the longest hitters in the event. Everything to the right of the green means trouble, meaning lay-ups and accurate wedge shots will be needed by many. La Mare aux Foulques Another short par four but a testing one owing to its uphill nature and the re-appearance of a water hazard, this time on the left. Thick rough protects the right. Short irons from the tee will be common. Les Grenouilles A hole which underwent major changes in with the water hazard guarding the front of the green extended and two new bunkers added at the back. One of Le Golf National less inspiring holes. Le Goulet A dogleg right with a long bunker down the left of the fairway and a shorter one to the right making for a difficult tee shot. The Ryder Cup website describes the green as “large (and) bumpy” so par could well be a winning score. L’Île aux Chênes Another dogleg right but this time water is the main hazard, both right of the fairway and in front of the green. A firm fairway also means balls can easily fly into deep rough. Oak trees protect the green. All in all; a tough prospect. Les Collines de Colin The last of the holes extended in the has a huge bunker defending the front and left-hand side of a two-tier green which slopes away from the players at the back. Wide from the tee, meaning two to the green is feasible. Le Juge The start of what could prove one of the most exciting and daunting closing Ryder Cup stretches. The has water running down the right side of the hole and in front of the green, making accuracy paramount. A firm green offers little margin for error. Four is a fine score. L’Appel Water protects the right-hand side of this hole, with any players bailing out to the left likely to be faced with a tricky downhill chip, a bunker shot or putt back towards the hazard. Le Verdict There are no bunkers or water hazards on the but the uphill tee shot and a green which slopes from right to left means par is far from guaranteed. Could reasonably be regarded as a par five. Hitting the fairway from the tee is vital. La Foule An exciting closing hole, with water all the way down the left – and in front of the green – plus pot bunkers on the right of the fairway. Used to be a par five before regrading. Strategy from the tee is imperative, if only to ease the sense of fear around the approach shot.",820,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/26/le-golf-national-a-hole-by-hole-guide-to-2018s-ryder-cup-course
4,"Should Lewis Hamilton go on to secure the world championship this year, his win at the Russian Grand Prix will be the only victory in a superlative season from which he will take no pleasure. His victory, ensured the moment Mercedes employed orders allowing him to pass his teammate, Valtteri Bottas , proved an ill-sitting success defined by the decidedly uncelebratory figures of the Mercedes drivers on the podium as well as their team below them. Hamilton has been explicit in the past in his desire for the team not to employ orders and was uncomfortable with their use in Russia after he took the flag in front of Bottas. “It is definitely a win on my list of wins that I am least proud of,” he said. “The strangest day I can remember in my career. I want to win the right way. As racing drivers we exist to win; if you tell us we can’t, it is like you are taking our life away. I would never wish it on someone else and I would never ask for it ever. I made sure in a meeting that they knew this is not how I want to win.” Lewis Hamilton wins the Russian Grand Prix – live! There was the expected disapproval that the distasteful spectre of team orders always provokes yet the decision was unsurprising. Team orders have long been legal in and Mercedes, aware of Ferrari strong challenge this year, were unwilling to leave anything to chance. It is an unedifying way for a race to be decided but it was both understandable and planned for. With Sebastian Vettel finishing third, Hamilton extended his title lead to points, a gain, as opposed to the three-point boost second place would have delivered. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, charged with returning a drivers’ and constructors’ title, was as ruthless as his board members would have wanted. “It deflating for drivers and for a team but there is a harsh reality also,” he said. “On a day like this you can extend the lead by seven points more in a championship that has been very tough and difficult at times, so you have to take it.” Hamilton echoed his rationale given what might still happen in the five races that remain. “The team were considering the car breaking down or losing two more engines,” he said. “We could lose the championship and that was their reasoning, hard as it is to swallow.” Esteban Ocon dilemma highlights the lack of chances for young drivers in | Giles Richards Ultimately Mercedes’ decision was brought about after they had been caught on the hop by Ferrari . With Bottas leading from pole and Hamilton and Vettel settling into second and third, the Scuderia took the initiative, sending Vettel into the pits for the undercut. The move worked and after Hamilton stop he emerged behind the German. Hamilton had to charge and he pressured Vettel, who locked up through turn Hamilton closed and made an effort to pass on the run to turn two. Vettel defended but was out of position and caught in turn four when Hamilton dived up the inside to retake the place. Coming back at Vettel had been at a cost of causing some blistering to his tyres. With the German still a threat the team opted to give Hamilton Bottas place, moving the Finn into a buffering position in front of Vettel. Bottas was visibly and understandably disappointed. He has yet to win this year and, with pole and leading the race, had done everything that might be expected of him. In Hungary last year, when he moved over for Hamilton, the British driver gave the place back when he could gain no advantage. The Finn may have hoped for a repeat but, with the title at stake, it was simply not going to happen. “Lewis is fighting for the drivers’ championship and I’m not,” Bottas acknowledged. “From the team point of view it was the ideal result today. Maybe not ideal for me but for the team, yes.” Vettel knows this was another stinging blow to his title hopes and, as he races for a team who have employed team orders brutally in the past, he was understanding of Mercedes’ decision. “Well done to both of them, they played together as a team very well,” he said. As the two Mercedes drivers faced the press afterwards he even came to their defence. “All the questions – I know you guys love controversy so therefore ask naughty questions to them as individuals, but I think in the position they are it a no-brainer what they did today. Maybe not all the questions are justified.” Certainly Mercedes will not lose any sleep as they head to the next round in Japan. If Hamilton does take the title, he will still have some exceptional performances to remember long after the discomfort of this one is forgotten but he will also remember he has cause to be thankful to Bottas. “Never, ever in my whole life has it been the way I’ve wanted to win a race,” he said. “I just want to shine it on to Valtteri. There are not many teammates who would do something like that.”",878,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/lewis-hamilton-wins-russian-grand-prix-mercedes-team-orders-sebastian-vettel

0,"The confirmed death toll from the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi has risen to and the vice-president, Jusuf Kalla, has warned it could reach into the thousands. More than aftershocks followed the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit Sulawesi on Friday, causing thousands of homes, hotels, shopping malls and several mosques to collapse. Of the fatalities, were in the city of Palu, with casualties so far recorded in Donggala, the worst-hit area, which is home to people. Hundreds of bodies have been found on beaches and authorities fear many may have been washed out to sea. Speaking at a press conference, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the BNBP disaster agency, said the area affected was much bigger than originally thought. “The deaths are believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached,” said Sutopo, emphasising that access to Donggala, as well as the towns of Sigi and Boutong, was very limited so the final death toll was impossible to predict. The city of Palu has been completely devastated by the earthquake and tsunami waves, which reached as high as six metres in some areas. In the city, partially covered bodies lay near the shore and survivors sifted through a tangled mess of corrugated steel roofing, timber, rubble and flotsam. One man was seen carrying the muddy corpse of a small child. “Many corpses are scattered on the beach and floating on the surface of the sea,” one local resident, Nining, told local media. The identified bodies are being buried in mass graves, Sutopo said. Sutopo confirmed there was no electricity in Palu and Donggala, while drinking water and fuel were running out. There was limited access to heavy equipment needed to help rescue efforts, so the search for people trapped in the rubble was mostly being carried out by hand. Rescue efforts are continuing for dozens of people still trapped in the collapsed ruins of the eight-storey Roa Roa hotel in Palu, with voices heard screaming from the wreckage. A woman was found alive during the evening in the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, according to the National Search and Rescue Agency, which released photos of the her lying on a stretcher covered in a blanket. There were concerns about the whereabouts of hundreds of people preparing for a beach festival that had been due to start on Friday, a spokesman for the BNBP said. Aerial footage shows tsunami destruction in Sulawesi – in pictures At least people had been badly injured, the agency said, as hospitals struggled to cope with the influx of casualties, setting up open-air clinics to treat the injured. Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu army hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the continuing strong aftershocks. Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter. “There was no time to save ourselves. I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” said Haris, adding that his family was in town for a wedding. “I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence. I don’t know what happened to her and my child. I hope they are safe.” The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, who visited the region on Sunday, said earlier the military was being called to the region to help search-and-rescue teams. Aerial footage shows tsunami destruction in Sulawesi – in pictures One of the first casualties of the earthquake, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, is being hailed a hero after he stayed in the air traffic control tower as the earthquake hit, to make sure that a flight to Bali could take off safely. Agung then jumped from the control tower as it was collapsing, but did not survive the fall. Many residents slept in makeshift shelters, terrified that the powerful aftershocks could topple their damaged homes. Some voiced criticism of the agency that lifted the tsunami warning . The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to “end” the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, about miles from Palu. “We have no observation data at Palu. So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that,” said Rahmat Triyono, the head of the earthquakes and tsunami centre at BMKG. He said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in the sea level, only recorded an “insignificant” wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu. We have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying Jan Gelfand, Red Cross The tsunami was triggered by a strong quake that brought down buildings and sent locals fleeing for higher ground as a churning wall of water crashed into Palu. “We all panicked and ran out of the house” when the quake hit, said Anser Bachmid, a Palu resident. “People here need aid – food, drink, clean water.” Dramatic video footage captured from the top floor of a parking ramp in Palu, nearly miles from the quake epicentre, showed waves bring down several buildings and inundate a large mosque. About people have been evacuated, the BNBP said. “This was a terrifying double disaster,” said Jan Gelfand, a Jakarta-based official at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “We have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying. There are more than people living there. This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.” Friday tremor was also felt in the far south of the island in its largest city Makassar and on neighbouring Kalimantan, Indonesia portion of Borneo island. The initial quake struck as evening prayers were about to begin in the world biggest Muslim-majority country on the holiest day of the week, when mosques are especially busy. Indonesia is one of the most disaster-prone nations on earth. It lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, where tectonic plates collide and many of the world volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur. Earlier this year, a series of powerful quakes hit Lombok, killing more than people on the holiday island and neighbouring Sumbawa. Indonesia has been hit by a string of other deadly quakes including a devastating tremor that struck off the coast of Sumatra in December That Boxing Day quake triggered a tsunami that killed throughout the region, including in Indonesia.",1078,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/indonesia-tsunami-cries-for-help-from-rubble-amid-fears-thousands-dead
1,"On Friday evening, Palu Talise beach had been heaving with people, gathered joyfully for the opening of the city Nomini music festival. But by Saturday morning, in the devastating aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that hit Sulawesi, the beach was strewn with bodies. Corpses could be seen floating in the sea. “Along the Palu coast, houses were swept away by the tsunami, including my house in Tondo, lost completely to the tsunami. Bodies are everywhere,” said Ical, a local journalist. The full extent of the damage done by the earthquake, the subsequent tsunami and aftershocks, is still unknown. The city of Palu, which was the focal point of most rescue efforts on Sunday, was strewn with debris but a lack of heavy equipment obstructed efforts to find survivors in the rubble, with rescuers just using their hands. The city is built around a narrow bay which it is believed may have intensified the force of the tsunami waters as they hit. Visible among the wreckage was a bridge broken in half, a mosque submerged in water, its turret and dome collapsed inwards, and a shopping mall reduced to a crumpled wreck. “It is believed there are still people trapped in the mall,” said a reporter from the Indonesian news outlet MetroTV. “I can smell the very strong odour of decaying bodies.” Rescuers spent the day attempting to rescue survivors who were heard screaming from the wreckage of Palu collapsed eight-storey Roa Roa hotel. Six people were pulled out alive but dozens are still trapped. “There are people under the rubble of the building. Heavy equipment is needed for evacuation,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the BNBP disaster agency. Muhammad Syaugi, head of the national search and rescue team, said that heavy equipment was on the way. “We are trying our best. Time is so important here to save people,” he added. Most bodies recovered in Palu were brought to a police hospital, where they began stacking up quickly, and by midday on Sunday, corpses were laid out in the courtyard under the baking sun. People desperately looking for relatives walked among the bodies, trying to identify faces. Among them was Baharuddin, who was searching for his son. “I have one child, he missing,” he said. “I last spoke to him before he went to school in the morning.” Sutopo said once identified, the bodies would be buried in mass graves immediately to stop the spread of disease, but would be “buried properly” later. The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday to inspect the damage. “There are many challenges,” Jokowi said to reporters. “We have to do many things soon, but conditions do not allow us to do so.” While the death toll sits at this barely accounts for the worst hit area, the city of Donggala, where people live and rescue teams are still struggling to reach. Rafiq Anshori, a spokesperson for the Red Cross on the ground in Palu, said he and his team had spent the day collecting bodies from the beach and outside buildings. He described the scenes the Red Cross team were encountering as “much worse than the earthquake in Lombok” – referring to the recent earthquake on the Indonesian island – and said most roads were cracked, making access difficult. He estimated around of buildings in Palu were destroyed. Tens of thousands of residents who escaped were in temporary shelters, many desperately trying to locate friends and relatives. “The ground rose up like a spine and suddenly fell,” said Palu resident Nur Indah through tears. “Many people were trapped and buried under collapsed houses. I could do nothing to help. In the evening, some of them turned on their cellphones just to give a sign that they were there. But the lights were off later and the next day.” Over people have been injured and many taken to makeshift outdoor clinics, as hospitals were unable to cope under the increasing pressure. Sitting outside the army hospital, Dwi Haris said he had only been in Palu for a wedding. Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter. “There was no time to save ourselves. I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” said Haris, who had suffered a broken back and shoulder. “I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence. I don’t know what happened to her and my child. I hope they are safe.”",755,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/bodies-everywhere-indonesia-rescue-efforts-focus-on-palu
2,"The homecoming of Brazil far-right presidential frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro from hospital was upstaged this weekend by huge demonstrations as concerns over his authoritarian tendencies grew. Bolsonaro flew from São Paulo to his home in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday, three weeks after being stabbed during campaigning , while tens of thousands of women filled the streets in cities across Brazil to protest against his extremist positions ahead of the October election. The news site reported anti-Bolsonaro protests in all Brazil states grew out of a Facebook group called Women United Against Bolsonaro which nearly million people have joined. Pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations took place in states, the site said. The piauí magazine website called the demonstrations “historic” and printed a photo of an enormous crowd in São Paulo which organisers claimed half a million attended, though police did not provide an estimate. In Rio the huge crowds that filled the city centre were notable for their diversity – with women of all ages, many of whom had brought children, male and LGBT demonstrators, chanting “not him”, an anti-Bolsonaro hashtag that has become a campaign slogan shared by celebrities like Madonna. Trump of the tropics: the 'dangerous' candidate leading Brazil presidential race Many demonstrators expressed concerns over Bolsonaro declaration in a television interview on Friday that he would not accept any election result he did not win because of his endorsement of the military dictatorship which ran Brazil for two decades. Flavia Carvalho, a civil servant, carried a “not him” banner designed around an Adolf Hitler cartoon. “He is preaching fascism,” she said. Others said they were protesting against the sexist, racist and homophobic views Bolsonaro has expressed. “He is sexist. He is misogynist. He is racist,” said Ana Paulo Gonçalves, a teacher. “He wants to go back to the military dictatorship,” said her sister Christine, a designer. Bolsonaro, a former army captain and veteran lawmaker, currently leads polling for a first-round vote on October. Running second is Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of São Paulo who took the place of formidably popular former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after Lula candidacy was barred because he is serving a prison sentence for graft. Bolsonaro and Haddad are expected to face off in a run-off vote on October. Making adept use of WhatsApp and social media, Bolsonaro has built support across Brazil, attacking Lula Workers’ party for its involvement in a huge graft scheme and espousing a hardline approach to law and order. His views have resonated with Brazilians angry and fearful over endemic corruption and rising violent crime. Supporters stage drive-by demonstrations, racing through towns across Brazil in convoys of cars and motorbikes, waving flags and blasting horns. The divisions Bolsonaro provokes in Brazil were evident in a video of him boarding Saturday flight from São Paulo. While some passengers regaled him with chants of “legend”, others yelled “fascist” and “not him”. Journey to Brazil heart: across miles and seven states, we ask – how will Brazilians vote? In a television interview broadcast on Friday, Bolsonaro suggested Brazil armed forces could intervene if his main rivals, the leftist Workers’ party, “committed a foul” in the election. “I don’t accept an election that is not me being elected,” Bolsonaro told reporter José Datena, adding that Brazil electronic voting system could be defrauded by the Workers’ party, but providing no evidence. Bolsonaro enjoys widespread support among police and the military. His vice-presidential candidate, Gen Hamilton Mourão, unnerved Brazilians recently when he said in a situation of “anarchy”, a president could declare an “auto-coup”. Both men praise the military dictatorship that ran Brazil from torturing and executing opponents. “I lived [during] this phase,” said Maria do Carmo, who was protesting in Rio and saw relatives imprisoned by the military regime. “It was terrible.” On Sunday, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper called on both leading candidates to make a commitment to democracy, accusing Bolsonaro of “stimulating paranoias of manipulation” and criticising the Workers’ party for its attacks on the justice system for Lula imprisonment it calls politically motivated.",672,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/huge-protests-in-brazil-as-far-right-presidential-hopeful-jair-bolsonaro-returns-home
3,"The future of Macedonia hung in the balance on Sunday as citizens voted in fewer than expected numbers in a referendum to rename their country seen as decisive for the western orientation of the strategic Balkan state. Macedonian polling stations opened under sunny skies on Sunday for a plebiscite on if the former Yugoslav republic adopts the name North Macedonia and is put on a path to EU and Nato membership. Macedonian vote: 'Either we become North Macedonia or North Korea' Turnout is paramount and, voting early on Sunday, the prime minister, Zoran Zaev, urged people to ignore appeals for a nationwide boycott and participate in a ballot called barely three months after Skopje reached a controversial name change agreement with Greece . “I call on everyone to come out and make this serious decision for the future of our country, for future generations,” he said, casting his ballot in the south-eastern town of Strumica, where he previously served as mayor. But by only minutes before polls closed, it had become clear that much fewer than expected had heeded his appeal. As the state electoral commission announced that just had voted jubilant protesters gathered in front of the parliament. “This is a bad day for Zaev and a wonderful day for Macedonians,” said Martin Dukovski, standing outside the parliament building holding a large red and yellow Macedonian flag. “I am a proud Macedonian. The government has to take back this deal. It has to say ‘no’ to Greece.” No vote has been as historic – or imbued with such sentiment – since the country declared independence in The referendum comes against a backdrop of polarisation, potentially explosive emotion and Russia reportedly stepping up clandestine efforts to dash Macedonia embrace by the west. Working in unison with hardcore nationalists bent on boycotting the vote, Moscow has openly voiced distaste for the deal with Greece. Until the accord announcement in June , Athens had vowed to block its neighbour accession to both the EU and Nato, protesting that – without a geographical qualifier – the name amounted to appropriation of its own cultural heritage and territorial ambitions. Within the borders of the landlocked republic, few issues have been as divisive. Many Macedonians argue that, with their country name also conveying a profound sense of identity, being asked to change it is tantamount to existential annihilation. “My first name is Makedonska,” said a hotel employee as she made her way to a polling station in a local school in central Skopje. “What are they [the Greeks] going to to do? Ask me to change that?” Addressing the UN last week, the republic president, Gjorge Ivanov, described the referendum and the dilemma it posed as “historical suicide”. The former university professor has openly asked his fellow citizens to boycott the vote. Although Zaev social democrat government has described the plebiscite as “consultative”, a low turnout would make it almost impossible to push the name-change deal through parliament, where it must receive overwhelming support if constitutional changes are to be ratified. The nationalist main opposition VMRO-DPMNE party, which has denounced the deal and is vehemently opposed to rewording the republic constitution, would find it much easier to resist ratification if fewer voters than expected backed the accord. The party leader, Hristijan Mickoski, appealed to Macedonians to “listen to their hearts” when they woke up on Sunday. The prospect of securing a majority turnout has been further hampered by an electoral list dramatically trimmed by young people emigrating in search of work. Of the million currently on the voting list, an estimated have moved abroad but according to officials have failed to deregister. In such circumstances, the outcome to great degree will hinge on the participation of Macedonia large ethnic Albanian community, which is – at about – its biggest minority. “We don’t have the emotional baggage of Slav Macedonians over the name issue,” said Petrit Sanagini, an ethnic Albanian, as he went to vote with his wife and baby daughter. “This is a compromise we feel we have to make to move our country forward towards a future of prosperity and security. It a historic day, a very special day. Our hope is that everyone will vote.” More than foreign observers are monitoring the plebiscite. In addition to EU and western officials, the referendum is being watched closely in neighbouring Kosovo, where fierce opposition to the prospect of territorial adjustments with Serbia spurred thousands to take to the streets on Saturday. To the consternation of the multi-ethnic territory Albanian majority, Moscow has backed the idea of land swaps. “We very much want Macedonians to accept this deal and join Nato,” said Albin Kurti, the opposition politician whose self-determination movement, Vetëvendosje, organised the protests. “It will deter Russian ambitions and interference in the region,” he told the Guardian in his Pristina office. “And that could not come at a better time.”",815,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/macedonia-to-vote-on-name-change-and-ending-greek-dispute
4,"Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz. Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag. Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto : “The sea is ours by right. To recover it is a duty.” Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict is still vivid – as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more. Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on October after five years of deliberations. Bolivia landlocked sailors pine for the high seas “Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat. Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia claim that – after decades of fitful talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea. Evo Morales, Bolivia charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – also has plenty riding on Monday ruling. “We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he vowed in late August. But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia favour – and that little would change if it did. The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks. That the ICJ ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case “wasn’t complicated”, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law. And far from furthering Bolivia cause, the past four years may have set it back. “The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate. Morales belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested. “Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk … [but] it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.” The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision-making was unusually speedy. Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “put an end to years of disagreements with mutual benefits”, he said. Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America most popular presidents – was using the maritime issue as a political crutch. “Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added. “The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”",475,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/landlocked-bolivia-pacific-sea-international-court-of-justice
5,"he civil war in Yemen is one of those obscure conflicts that feels as though it has been going on for ever. In the space of little more than three years, the conflict has become what the UN and aid agencies agree is the world worst man-made humanitarian disaster, with civilians killed or wounded, million people facing famine, a nation torn apart and an economy destroyed. The killing of children, hit by missiles and shells smashing into their homes and schools or stricken by disease and malnutrition, has come to symbolise Yemen war. The UN latest Children and Armed Conflict report found that children were killed or maimed in Just over half died in air attacks by the western-backed, pro-government coalition, and many others at the hands of Houthi rebels. Yet perhaps most extraordinary, and dismaying, is the counter-productive response of the governments principally concerned. There has been intervention aplenty since – by the Saudis, the UAE, Iran, the US and the UK – but their actions have served to inflame the conflict, not extinguish it. In the very limited discussions about Yemen among national leaders at the UN last week, it was clear the conflict is getting worse, not better. The collapse in Geneva of the latest UN-sponsored peace talks could trigger the war bloodiest chapter yet August was the most violent month so far this year, with nearly people killed in nine days, according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC). There has been a spike in civilian deaths in the last four months, and this rate of attrition is expected to rise further amid the Saudi-led, pro-government coalition resumed offensive on the port of Hodeidah. Overall, since the coalition has launched airstrikes, one-third of which are said to have hit non-military targets. “The world needs a wake-up call to the situation in Yemen,” said David Miliband, the former UK foreign secretary and IRC president, after visiting this month. “With more than million people in need of aid, of the population lacking access to basic healthcare and nearly half lacking access to clean drinking water … there is reason enough to believe the worst is yet to come.” Miliband assessment that no side was winning the war, and his call for an immediate ceasefire, has been echoed by other agencies. “Yemen is a disaster and I don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel right now,” David Beasley, director of the World Food Programme, said last week. Access for relief agencies was a particular problem, he added, accusing the Iranian-backed Houthis of “ breaking every human principle imaginable ”, including impeding food deliveries. In a commentary published by the International Crisis Group, Yemen consultant Peter Salisbury warned that the collapse in Geneva earlier this month of the latest UN-sponsored peace talks could trigger the war bloodiest chapter yet . “An avoidable tragedy now looks inevitable absent swift and forceful intervention by UN security council member states, the US in particular,” Salisbury wrote. Hopes that Saudi Arabia and the UAE, currently intensifying military operations, will voluntarily desist appear forlorn. Nor is there any indication that Iran, which believes it has the upper hand and views Yemen as part of a region-wide struggle with the Sunni Arab monarchies of the Gulf, is ready to back off. Donald Trump assertion at the UN that Tehran was causing “havoc and slaughter” in Syria and Yemen, and his praise for Saudi leaders, suggests escalation is more probable. Nor is there much likelihood that a Brexit-obsessed Britain, despite harsh domestic criticism of its military assistance in planning airstrikes and its arms sales to the Saudi regime, will act. France, another UN security council permanent member, is similarly compromised by prior support for the coalition and lucrative arms sales. Like the US and UK, it reportedly has special forces on the ground , engaged in counter-terrorism operations against Islamist extremists. All of which leaves one possible ray of light for the suffering Yemenis. Last week more than members of the US House of Representatives backed a bipartisan resolution invoking the War Powers Act, declaring that Congress never authorised US support for the coalition in Yemen, as it is legally bound to do under the act, and directing Trump to withdraw all American military personnel. Action is also pending in the US Senate , where Bob Menendez – the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee – is blocking a arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. “Widespread destruction and disease [are] contributing to the world worst humanitarian crisis. US-fuelled planes continue to drop US-made bombs on innocent victims,” said Democrat Ro Khanna, the House resolution lead sponsor. A showdown vote is expected after November elections. Both moves are certain to be fiercely opposed by the Trump administration, which argues its military assistance and expertise reduces the number of civilian deaths. But both reflect growing public abhorrence at a series of atrocities, including a horrific bus bombing that killed dozens of children last month, which could implicate the US government and personnel in war crimes. “The actions of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen are fast approaching the level of crimes against humanity,” said Democrat Jim McGovern. “The US must send a clear and unambiguous message to Saudi Arabia – their actions are unacceptable to the international community and will not be tolerated.”",889,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/yemen-finds-chance-of-hope-on-capitol-hill-house-senate
6,"The Week in Patriarchy is a weekly roundup of what happening in the world of feminism and sexism. If you’re not already receiving it by email, make sure to subscribe . The reaction to the Kavanaugh hearing proves that America hates women There was a moment on Thursday, while watching Dr Christine Blasey Ford brave and moving testimony, that I thought that was it: there was no way Brett Kavanaugh would be confirmed. Even Fox News called Ford testimony “extremely credible”. If Kavanaugh was confirmed when even Fox had to concede Ford was credible, then what message would that send about America attitude towards women? What message would that send to high school kids about the consequences of their actions? ‘We’re in a screwed-up world’: Trump accusers respond to Kavanaugh hearing Then, when it was Kavanaugh turn to speak, I was even more certain he couldn’t possibly be given a lifelong seat on the supreme court. Judges are supposed to be measured and objective. He came across as an entitled hothead, unable to control his emotions, blaming everyone except himself for his current situation. If Kavanaugh was confirmed after that performance, the credibility of the supreme court, the credibility of America, would surely be undermined. There was no way it could happen. Well, it looks like I completely underestimated the pull of patriarchy in America. If you’re a rich, white guy with powerful friends it seems you can get away with anything. Kavanaugh hasn’t been confirmed yet, but the Wall Street Journal editorial board has called for him to be confirmed and Republicans are rallying around him. It looking increasingly likely he’ll be given a lifelong appointment to impose his will on America, no matter how women feel about it. But Republicans shouldn’t expect women to accept this without a fight. We will march, we will strike, we will run for office. We have had enough: patriarchy is on borrowed time. How to prove you didn’t sexually assault anyone: the Brett Kavanaugh playbook Sorry to keep on about Kavanaugh, but the entire episode really has been a case study in rape culture. Let review, shall we? Here are five defenses that Kavanaugh, a supposed genius in law, actually thought were credible. Say you were a virgin. In an interview with Fox News that aired on Monday, Kavanaugh stated, unprompted, he was a virgin for years after high school. If you think, as Kavanaugh appears to, that being a virgin means you can’t be guilty of sexual assault, then you have no right to be a judge in the first place, let alone on the supreme court. Use your daughter as a political pawn. In his testimony on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he meant no ill will to his accuser and, in fact, his daughter wanted to pray for Ford. He choked up after delivering this anecdote. I’d like to think in shame, but I’m not sure he is capable of feeling anything other than self-pity and entitlement. Dig out a calendar from Look, it doesn’t say “attempted to rape someone tonight on it”! Clear sign of innocence there. Reiterate how much you like beer. During the Thursday hearing Kavanaugh mentioned he liked beer around times. He even asked a senator if they liked drinking beer, too. Can you imagine a woman telling a Senate judiciary committee how much she enjoyed drinking? She’d immediately be characterized as an irresponsible slut who deserved anything that happened to her. When men get drunk, it a whole different story. Convince more than women you know to get on stage in support. If you’ve been nice to one woman, it stands to reason that you can’t have sexually assaulted another one, right? That supreme court justice thinking right there. 'Bill Cosby took my spirit and crushed it': Andrea Constand speaks out on sexual assault Now for some good news from other supreme courts around the world On October, the UK supreme court will have a majority of female judges decide a case for the first time in its history. India supreme court has ruled adultery is no longer a crime . The court ruled that the colonial-era law, which criminalized a woman having an extramarital sexual relationship without her husband consent, was archaic and discriminated against women. “It is time to say husband is not the master,” said the chief justice, Dipak Misra. India supreme court seems to be on a roll. It has also ruled that women can no longer be banned from Sabarimala temple , which is one of the holiest for Hindus. Before this ruling, women of a menstruating age (which was defined as were barred from entering the temple in Kerala. And let not forget – Bill Cosby is finally behind bars On Tuesday, Cosby was sentenced to three to years for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home years ago. It took decades for justice to be served, but as attorney Gloria Allred, who represents several women who say they were assaulted by Cosby, said: “We’re glad that judgment day has finally come.” Kavanaugh, I hope you’re paying attention.",850,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/kavanaugh-ford-hearing-protest-patriarchy-borrowed-time
7,"For more than years, Black History Month has been a fixture in Britain cultural calendar, celebrated every October in schools and at tens of thousands of events across the country. But this year the event, which starts on Monday, is at the centre of an appropriation row as campaigners complain that a number of councils have scrapped the name, describing it instead as a celebration of all different ethnicities. The historian and broadcaster, David Olusoga , is among those who have spoken out to defend the need to keep the month focused on black history. The shadow equalities minister, Dawn Butler, said the Windrush scandal exposed the need to keep black history in sharp focus. The Conservative-led London borough of Hillingdon, in west London, stopped Black History Month in and resisted attempts earlier this month to get it reinstated, instead focusing on a programme of multi-ethnic events called Culture Bite with events on south Asia, country dancing and wine tasting. Wandsworth , the Conservative flagship borough in south London, has similarly reinvented the celebration as “Diversity Month”, and contracted it out to a company called Better which manages Wandsworth libraries. Diversity Month, explains Better website, is intended to be a time of “celebrating and learning together about the many and varied experiences and cultures within our borough”. Events feature Indian, Polish, Spanish, Chinese as well as African and Caribbean cultures. Boroughs such as Hillingdon and Wandsworth are highly diverse. Wandsworth Asian population is the same size as its black, African and Caribbean population, according to the census. Hillingdon south Asian population is twice the size of its black population at Nationally of the population is black, African, Caribbean and black British while is Asian and Asian British. Black History Month highlights the contribution of Britain high profile figures in the arts and politics, as well as the lives of people like Stephen Lawrence, whose murder triggered nationwide soul-searching about institutional racism. Olusoga, who contributes to Black History Month talks, said he was disappointed some councils were trying to dilute it. “I’ve been critical of Black History Month in the past, but I think it really is becoming a shared experience. We can have Black History Month with all people learning about it. Can black people not create things without being seen as exclusive? Black History Month feels to me really inclusive.” Butler said: “Windrush has highlighted just why Black History Month is so important. It is important that it remains focused on the contribution of African-Caribbean people. It makes a huge difference to hear black history spoken about positively. But it also important that people are reminded of black history.” Uncertainty about the point of the event has spread to schools. Earlier this week a primary school in Lewisham, south London was challenged by parents after proposing it should be expanded to “My History Month” so every child family history could be celebrated. Last year, the head teacher of St Winefride Catholic primary school in Newham, east London, apologised after asking parents to send children dressed as slaves in “dirty and worn-out” clothes for a special assembly. The social commentator Patrick Vernon , who edits Black History Month magazine, said rebrandings of the event were “shameful”. “Black History Month was established years ago because the black experience in Britain was not recognised in the national curriculum and in mainstream society,” he said. “Unfortunately we do not live in a post-racial Britain. If we did perhaps we would not need Black History Month.” June Nelson, a Labour councillor in Hillingdon, first tried to get Black History Month reinstated in the borough in and was rebuffed. Earlier this month she tabled another motion calling for it to be restored, but was once again unsuccessful . Nelson said there was nothing in the council Culture Bite programme that focused on black history. “I feel terribly angry,” she said. “This month should be set aside specifically for black history but there is nothing in there pertaining to the history of black people. “When I became a councillor in and it was first brought to my attention they said they did not have the funds for it. I took my eye off the ball for a few years, then when I started making enquiries, I went to a few of the schools and they weren’t doing anything, apart from putting up a few pictures on their noticeboard.” Nelson, a healthcare assistant who came to the UK from Guyana in said Black History Month was needed now more than ever, with escalating rightwing rhetoric and growing divisions in society as the UK moves towards Brexit. “I think it important that we remember the black people who have contributed to our daily existence, in every aspect.” A spokesman for Wandsworth council said: “We are proud to celebrate the historical achievements and successes of all the diverse communities that make up our borough and who all contribute so much to life in our city. We do continue to recognise and celebrate Black History Month with a number of specific events but we also at the same time celebrate all the different faiths, ethnicities, cultures and genders of all who live in our borough.” Hillingdon declined to comment. Linda Bellos, former leader of Lambeth council who introduced Black History Month to the UK years ago , said: “The involvement of black peoples in all strands of cultural and political life is often omitted and the impression created is that there is little or no positive contribution except within music and sport. “Black men and women who have played a significant and positive role in the history of Britain are written out of history. This needs to be acknowledged.” The origins of Black History Month There was a “negro history week” in in the United States, but the first Black History Month took place in the at Kent State University in Ohio. It took root in the UK in on the prompting, some say, of Ansel Wong , a Trinidadian activist in London and the head of the ethnic minority unit in the Greater London Council. According to Linda Bellos, a former leader of Lambeth council who developed the idea, the guest of honour at the launch was Sally Mugabe, the first wife of Robert Mugabe. The events placed historical figures such as the nurse Mary Seacole on a par with Florence Nightingale. In the black newspaper New Nation listed Jesus, the Rev Martin Luther King and Malcolm X as the top black icons. The event has drawn criticism from black people that if historical black figures are important then they should be considered year-round, and also that the month becomes about hero worship rather than critical understanding.",1118,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/councils-condemned-for-shameful-rebranding-of-black-history-month

9,"The town of Terrebonne is a collection of shopping malls and housing subdivisions amid vast stretches of what used to be farmland a drive north of Montreal. As a general rule, the streets are tidy and commuter traffic is wretched. And unlike most Montrealers, its citizens have enduringly and overwhelmingly supported the cause of Quebec separatism. But provincial elections on Monday are threatening the latter truism. Terrebonne is one of the last few redoubts of the Parti Québécois , which seeks to extricate Quebec from Canada . But according to polls, the PQ candidate trails his opponent from the Coalition Avenir Québec , a self-declared nationalist party that is nonetheless comfortable with Quebec place in Canada. All around Terrebonne, former fiefdoms of the PQ have either already fallen or are poised to be taken by the CAQ. Similarly, the CAQ wave will likely gobble up districts in and around Quebec City and engulf swaths of the province rural heartland – almost all of which were once reliably separatist. The CAQ is vying to replace the governing Liberal Party of Quebec, which despite myriad corruption scandals has governed Quebec for all but months of the last years. Parti Québécois governments held referendums in and on the issue of Quebec sovereignty – and lost both. Now, in contrast to flourishing separatist movements in Catalonia and Scotland, both the PQ and its raison d’être look like spent forces. “At a certain point you have to look at the numbers and realise that the dream of a separate Quebec is dead,” says Patrick Légaré, who lives in Terrebonne. Légaré once counted himself a true believer in the cause. He was a proud Péquiste for decades, and one of million Quebecers who voted to separate in the referendum – only to watch his side lose by less than votes. After starting a family and becoming a high school teacher, his passion for sovereignty turned to resignation with the status quo. During this campaign, he volunteered to hang election posters for a local CAQ candidate. “I’m part of the middle class. We haven’t had anyone in government in Terrebonne in a long time, and it shows in our lack of infrastructure. We need someone who can beat the Liberals – and it isn’t the PQ,” he says. So unpopular is the cause of separation that PQ leader Jean-François Lisée renounced the idea of holding a referendum on the subject until a second mandate of a putative Péquiste government. Despite this, his party has languished in the polls throughout the campaign and is now in a pitched battle for third place with Québec Solidaire , an upstart socialist party founded in The PQ diminished threat is the main reason why, for the first time in nearly years, separatism isn’t a significant electoral issue. The slow collapse of the movement lies in its demographics. Separatism began in the during Quebec “ Quiet Revolution ” – the bloodless overthrow of Catholicism and the Anglophone ruling classes that had both exerted an outsized social and economic influence in the province. Early Quebec nationalists saw separation as a natural progression. Yet the movement wasn’t able to maintain itself through near-constant infighting and two lost referendums. “To put it bluntly, old sovereignists are dying off and there simply aren’t very many young sovereignists to take their place,” says Claire Durand, a public opinion analyst at Université de Montréal. A recent IPSOS poll said only of those ages to considered themselves separatists. The CAQ has positioned itself as the receptacle of choice for disaffected nationalists. Lead by François Legault, himself a former Parti Québécois cabinet minister, the CAQ gains have come mostly at the expense of the Parti Québécois. A one-time diehard separatist, Legault declared the idea “dead” in How did Quebec nationalist movement become so white? Legault has also criticised the current Quebec government immigration regime, suggesting the roughly yearly new arrivals to the province have a detrimental effect on the French language and culture. He has proposed French and “Quebec values” test for immigrants, with deportation from Quebec for those who fail either. (He has since backed off the deportation rhetoric – in part because citizenship is the jurisdiction of the federal government.) Critics say Legault is exploiting the collective fear of Quebecers for electoral gain. “There is part of the population that has a tribal mentality, and Legault comes in with simple solutions and he asks nothing of his voters,” says Jean Dorion, a former politician and an enduring figure in Quebec separatist movement. Though immigration dominated both the rhetoric and the coverage of the campaign, many Quebecers don’t see it as a ballot box issue. A recent study by La Presse, the province main daily, said it placed well behind more pressing priorities such as the environment, health and the economy. Légaré priorities are schools, infrastructure and an end to the Liberal reign — and that means bringing about an end to the PQ. “My vote for the CAQ isn’t from the heart, it practical,” he says. “We believe the dream for a country is dead and we just want to get rid of the Liberals.”",857,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/terrebonne-hold-out-of-quebec-separatism-faces-end-of-the-dream
10,"It was once the world biggest monument to Josef Stalin, casting a dark shadow over Prague at the height of the communist dictatorship that ruled the former Czechoslovakia. Now the smashed granite remnants of the notorious statue will form the eerie backdrop to an exhibition highlighting the Czech Republic often brutal experiences of totalitarianism under Nazism and communism. Visitors will be given a tour of the central European country struggles under oppression just yards from the clearly visible pile of rubble that is all that remains of the sculpture designed as a tribute to the Soviet tyrant when he was at the peak of his powers. The exhibition, organised by Post Bellum – a group dedicated to preserving Czech historical memory – opens on Monday in an underground chamber directly beneath the hilltop location in Letná Park where the statue stood before it was blown up in after the personality cult surrounding Stalin had been discredited. It will pinpoint nine landmark events in the national encounters with dictatorship, beginning with Nazi Germany invasion of Czechoslovakia in March and ending with the mass demonstrations of the Velvet Revolution that ended more than years of communist domination. One dramatic scene simulates the experience of an RAF fighter pilot in a Spitfire plane engaging a German Messerschmitt in the Battle of Britain in It is based on the experience of František Peřina, one of several exiled Czechoslovakian flying aces who served with the RAF in the second world war. Most were persecuted by the communist authorities after returning home and Peřina later fled to Canada. There will also be mock-ups of secret police interrogation cells, where political prisoners were held before the Stalinist show trials of the early and a depiction of the church crypt where the British-trained assassins of Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the Nazi occupation authority, were hunted down and killed in Outside, a temporary five-metre-high wall has been constructed to resemble the Berlin Wall, but also to symbolise calls by contemporary leaders to build barriers against migrants. The display is timed to coincide with a host of events marking the forthcoming anniversary of Czechoslovakia establishment on October as the Habsburg empire collapsed in defeat at the end of the first world war. Featuring oral testimonies, it will run initially until December but organisers hope to use the exhibition to lobby for a permanent publicly funded museum to totalitarianism, something the Czech Republic lacks in contrast to neighbouring countries such as Poland and Hungary. “The lack of a national museum is embarrassing,” said Mikuláš Kroupka, Post Bellum director. “When people visit here and ask where they can go and learn about our recent history and the history of communism, there is nowhere. Prague does have a Museum of Communism but it a private enterprise and not really enough.” The need has become more urgent, campaigners say, because of recent political developments including the growth of the European far right and the return of the Czech Communist party to the fringes of power as a supporter of the minority government of prime minister Andrej Babiš . The former monument site – now a popular location for skateboarders – is is still commonly referred to as “Stalin”, reflecting the Soviet dictator enduring impact. However, the proposal faces opposition from supporters of a rival plan to turn the space into a contemporary art gallery, whose backers include the Prague mayor, Adriana Krnáčová, and Babiš. Finished in two years after Stalin death, the statue became an embarrassment after he was denounced the following year by his successor as Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev. The sculptor, Otakar Švec, killed himself days before it was unveiled. Ironically, the Letná site also witnessed the biggest anti-communist demonstration in when hundreds of thousands gathered to demand an end to the regime. “The place is a symbol of the humiliation of the Czech nation but also of freedom,” said Kroupka. “It the perfect location.”",654,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/stalin-rubble-throws-into-focus-czechs-20th-century-struggles
11,"In a city yet to name even a side-street after Coco Chanel or Christian Dior, Parisians stepped out on Sunday to do their organic shopping at a street market named after the fashion designer Sonia Rykiel. Hours earlier, the city mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had declared Allée Sonia Rykiel open, with her label staging its Paris fashion week show between the twinkling lights of the market stalls. The allée is in the middle of a grand Left Bank boulevard where the late designer, who died in did her fruit and vegetable shopping. It is the first time the French capital has named any kind of thoroughfare after a fashion designer. To celebrate, Rykiel successor, Julie de Libran, staged a Parisian market-themed show, with her models carrying baguettes or popping out for a bit of broccoli in lace nighties and techno trenchcoats. The collection was inspired by the “petit filet” string shopping bags that are de rigueur among Paris hipster “bobos”. “Sonia Rykiel gave us a taste for freedom. She was the most Parisian of Parisians,” said Hidalgo. The designer opened her first shop a stone throw away in Saint-Germain-des-Prés just as French students rose up in revolt in May Authorities in the French capital would not comment on whether there were any future plans for a Boulevard Karl Lagerfeld or Avenue Christian Dior. A street named after Chanel is seen as politically tricky in a city that mostly votes for the left because of the designer spending much of the Nazi occupation in the Ritz hotel with her lover, the German intelligence officer Baron Hans Gunther von Dincklage.",267,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/allee-sonia-rykiel-first-paris-street-named-after-a-fashion-designer
12,"he road link between Greece and Macedonia has never looked better. Newly tunnelled, cemented, widened and signposted, it winds through rolling hills, past vineyards and villages and wood-covered slopes all the way to Skopje, the former Yugoslav republic capital. The European Union takes great pride in this. At a time of impoverished connections between the two bickering Balkan neighbours, the newly paved route is concrete proof of what progress and prosperity can achieve. Every few miles a billboard proclaims it is the EU that co-funded the road “rehabilitation”. When Macedonians vote on Sunday in a referendum that could result in changing their country name – and resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece – Brussels hopes it is projects like this that will sway their ballots. A yes vote would not only see the tiny state being renamed North Macedonia but would clear the path to membership of Nato and the EU. As the military alliance member, the landlocked republic, which came close to inter-ethnic conflict in would secure the stability and security it has long craved in a region prone to shifting borders and bloody strife. For Petre Shilegov, the mayor of Skopje, the choice is a no-brainer. “It very simple. Either we become North Macedonia or North Korea,” he says with strident emphasis in his airy single-storey office. “Our opponents have no plan B. They can only offer isolation.” With Macedonians facing record unemployment, economic stagnation and few prospects, the referendum offers a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to move forward. “The EU spends approximately per day supporting Macedonia,” Shilegov explained. “If we have a yes, that sum will increase and everything in our country will get better – in our schools, in our hospitals, on our streets.” The high-stakes vote follows a landmark accord struck with Greece in June , almost years after the republic seceded from Yugoslavia and declared independence. Under the deal, signed on the banks of Lake Prespa by Skopje social democrat prime minister, Zoran Zaev, and Athens’ leftist leader, Alexis Tsipras, Greece pledged to lift objections that have thwarted the nation EU and Nato integration on condition that the state agreed to amend its name by adding a geographical qualifier and dropped any claim to cherished Greek cultural figures including Alexander the Great. Athens has argued with vigour that unless distinguished from the adjacent Greek province of Macedonia, the republic nomenclature would forever imply thinly disguised territorial ambitions towards a region that includes the strategic warm-water port of Thessaloniki. Greeks, in return, have had to accept their neighbours as internationally recognised Macedonians who speak the Macedonian language even if, as Slavs, they bear no relation to the ancient Macedonian warrior king. On Sunday, Macedonians will be asked if they endorse the agreement once and for all. “We are very lucky to have had Zaev and Tsipras on both sides,” enthused Sasho Ordanovski, Skopje preeminent political commentator. “Macedonia has been a rare success story of peaceful coexistence in the Balkans,” he said of the ability of the country Slavic Orthodox majority and Muslim Albanian minority to live together harmoniously. “But membership of the EU and Nato will enable us to finally secure the liberal consensus to guarantee this model of multi-ethnic, cultural, multi-religious democracy.” At the heart of the Balkan peninsular, Macedonia has long been viewed as a potential powder keg with the strength to ignite a major regional conflagration, which is why the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the US defence secretary, James Mattis, have all descended on Skopje in recent weeks to back the name deal and cheer Macedonians on. “Suddenly it is as if our country is at the centre of the world,” Shilegov smiled, listing the high-profile visitors one by one. “This vote is too important to fail.” Government officials and western diplomats animatedly predict that the plebiscite will pass. But, as in Greece, the compromise it entails has elicited ferocious nationalist opposition. Until campaigning officially ended at midnight on Thursday, protesters such as Goran, in a baseball cap and floppy jacket, were handing out leaflets in Skopje central square exhorting pedestrians to boycott the referendum. In an atmosphere described as both febrile and calm, anti-agreement propaganda has proliferated. By the eve of the vote the republic myriad “fake news” farms – infamous for the role they played in disseminating disinformation before the US elections – had reportedly gone into overdrive, with opponents making widespread use of social media in an effort to suppress voter participation. Decrying the deal, President Gjorge Ivanov has urged Macedonians to boycott the referendum. Some million citizens are eligible to cast ballots but a massive exodus of young people in search of work means confusion abounds as to how many are still in the country. “At least of the voter list are not physically present but they still contribute to the threshold of said Marko Trostanovski, who heads the Institute for Democracy thinktank in Skopje. “In reality we have to hit a threshold of and achieving that is mission impossible.” A low turnout could unleash a scenario where the Zaev government is unable to persuade Skopje parliament to endorse the constitutional changes to push the name deal through. Shilegov, a senior figure in the ruling social democrat party, is leaving nothing to chance. In recent weeks he has been going door-to-door to convince citizens of the need to cast ballots. “People have to have an opinion about this. They just can’t stay at home and go along with the boycott.” But there are worrying signs. In recent months Moscow has intensified its campaign to spoil the vote, with the fiercely pro-Russia United Macedonia party leading the boycott drive. With its augmented staff, Skopje Russian embassy has been described as a hothouse of intelligence activity. Visiting the capital, Mattis warned of the perils that lay ahead, accusing the Kremlin of employing underhand means and “malicious cyber activity” to scupper the vote. While Moscow has denied the charges, it has been open in its disgruntlement over Nato encroachment into the western Balkans, an area long regarded as a traditional sphere of influence. “Skopje right now is a bit like Casablanca before the war,” said Trostanovski. “It is a city full of spies and operatives all watching how the vote will go.”",1046,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/macedonian-vote-either-we-become-north-macedonia-or-north-korea
13,"Fears that Italy is on a collision course with the EU over its spending plans triggered sharp falls in European markets after the new government in Rome unveiled a deficit-widening budget . The coalition of the Five Star Movement and the League announced budget plans late on Thursday that would push the deficit – the gap between income from taxes and expenditure – to three times the size of the spending gap under the previous administration. Italy budget drama – all you need to know Though within the prescribed EU limit of of GDP, the proposals rattled traders, who fear the anti-establishment par ties are not committed to tackling the Italian debt pile, which at about of GDP is the biggest in the eurozone behind Greece. The plan from the coalition of the League leader, Matteo Salvini, and the Five Star Movement leader, Luigi Di Maio, will push the deficit to next year, despite suggestions from the country technocratic finance minister, Giovanni Tria. In recent weeks, Tria had indicated that the figure was likely to be below Italian government bonds dropped on Friday, pushing up the cost of borrowing on international markets for the country, while there was a sell-off in bank stocks. The yield, or interest rate, on Italian debt rose to as investors priced in higher risk. Italian stocks fell by more than on the FTSE MIB index in Milan, while there were also losses in Germany, where the Dax fell in Spain, where the Ibex fell and in France, with a decline of on the CAC. In London, the FTSE declined by Italy banking index was down with shares in the country two largest banks, Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit, also falling by There are fears that problems in the Italian banking sector could spread to other EU countries, including France, Spain and Portugal, with the potential to reignite a financial crisis across the eurozone. Prof Costas Milas of Liverpool University Management School said: “The Italian ‘virus’ has the potential to spread rapidly in other EU countries.” Wall Street opened lower amid concerns over the situation in Italy and lingering fears over the US trade dispute with China, before American stock markets staged a gradual recovery in afternoon trading in New York. Salvini and Di Maio heralded the budget proposal as one designed to end poverty, in a country where youth unemployment has soared since the financial crisis and GDP has failed to return to its pre-crisis peak. Some economists argue Brussels should give the country a wide berth to stimulate its economy with greater government spending and tax cuts, because an austerity-driven approach over the past decade has largely failed. The government plans to push ahead with a minimum income for those out of work, new welfare policies and more generous pensions. Funding a universal basic income will cost which Di Maio says will lift million people, long ignored by previous administrations, out of poverty. Compared with the previous government target for a deficit of next year, the largest contribution to the widening gap between income and spending comes from the repeal of the planned January VAT increase , which economists said was worth of GDP. Further details are yet to emerge about the Italian spending plans. Italy must submit a draft budget to the European commission for review by October. The Italian parliament will debate and vote on the plan before the end of the year. Investors, however, are concerned that tensions between Italy and the EU over its proposals could become inflamed in coming weeks. There are also fears the coalition may fail and snap elections could be called. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, warned increasing the Italian government deficit would raise the cost of paying back its loans. “Italians must not be mistaken: every euro more of debt is one euro less for the highways, for schools, for social justice,” he said on Friday.",655,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/28/european-markets-fall-after-italy-deficit-widening-budget-plans
14,"A major Danish police operation shut two key road bridges to traffic and halted ferry services to neighbouring Sweden and Germany , effectively isolating the country capital, Copenhagen, for several hours. The Oresund bridge linking Denmark and Sweden, the setting of the Nordic noir series The Bridge, and the Great Belt bridge between the islands of Zeland and Funen later reopened as hundreds of Danish police and soldiers used cars, sniffer dogs and helicopters to hunt for a black Swedish-registered rental car. The driver and two passengers in the car, hired from a Hertz agency in Stockholm, were wanted in connection with “a serious crime”, Danish police said in a statement, adding that anyone who saw the vehicle should “on no account try to make contact with the occupants, but notify the police immediately”. The eastern island of Zeland, where Copenhagen is located, was cut off for about two hours, causing long tailbacks and leaving thousands of travellers stranded around Copenhagen. Copenhagen airport remained open but train traffic to and from the city central station was temporarily suspended, while ferry services were slowly recovering and some trains linking western Denmark to Copenhagen skipped some stops to catch up.

15,"The last time Renata Souza saw her friend and colleague Marielle Franco, they hugged and kissed and said they’d see each other the following morning. They were scheduled to meet with higher-ups from their political party to finalize Franco as a vice-gubernatorial candidate for the state of Rio de Janeiro. But minutes after they parted, a reporter called Souza to tell her that Franco had been murdered. A breakout star on Rio political scene, Franco was a black woman from one of the city poorest favelas who defied the odds to become the fifth most voted-for councilor in 'I'm waiting for her to come back': Marielle Franco fiancee on life a month after Rio councillor murder She was an outspoken critic of Rio heavy-handed police and had recently become the chair of the committee overseeing the city federally mandated military intervention . Franco and her driver Anderson Gomes died instantly when two men opened fire on their car on March in what police believe was a targeted assassination. No arrests have been made, but as Brazil prepares for legislative elections, Franco legacy can be seen across the country: an unprecedented number of black women have registered to run for office – and many invoke her example on the campaign trail. As well as choosing a new president next Sunday, October, Brazilians will also elect congresspeople, senators and more than state legislators. Although she was a local politician, Franco murder fuelled an urgent conversation about racial and gender representation among Brazil elected officials. While black women are of the population – Brazil largest demographic group – they only hold of seats in congress. This new generation of politicians – often campaigning with the slogan “ Marielle presente ” – hopes to start levelling the playing field. Souza is now running for a seat as a state legislator. “I always thought about being on the frontline myself, but Marielle murder brought a sense of urgency. I hesitated for months, but knew I had to run,” she said. “Now I feel her every single moment – in every flyer I hand out, every speech I give, every conversation, every joke.” Souza and Franco met as teenagers in a college prep course in Maré, the Rio favela where they both grew up. They both won scholarships to one of Rio best private universities and went on to pursue graduate degrees. They became outspoken human rights activists and became involved with a newly founded leftwing party, the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL). After Franco was elected in Souza became her chief of staff. “I feel a responsibility to continue what we’d been building for the years we were activists together,” Souza explained. If elected, she will focus on legislation related to reducing the number of homicides of poor, black residents in Rio periphery. The first bill she hopes to pass would ban police operations during the hours when children are going and coming from school . Ahead of next month election, a group of women launched Black Women Decide, a collective aiming to raise black female candidates’ profiles and present data about the challenges confronting black women in politics. Brazil current congress includes only black women. In the election, of total campaign spending for congressional candidates went towards black women, even though they represented of candidacies. Juliana Marques, a member of the collective, says the dynamics of funding create a vicious cycle, as parties tend to invest most money in incumbent candidates. “The rules of the game are rigged. But we’re the largest portion of the population – for the sake of democracy, we should have lawmakers that are at least somewhat similar to the demographic makeup of the population.” Many voters agree. “Marielle was our voice. It was such a blow to lose her, but I never expected in my lifetime to see so many black women running,” said Martilde Guilhermina, at a rally in Rio, where Souza and other black female candidates were speaking. “Politics is a space where we black women have always been denied access.” Igor Soares, a high school teacher, said: “You don’t need to look far in Brazil to see how diverse it is … I’d like to see politics reflect that more, in order to make Brazil less racist and less machista .” Journey to Brazil heart: across miles and seven states, we ask – how will Brazilians vote? After a recent rally in Rio, Dani Monteiro, a from a Rio favela also running for a seat in the state legislature, said: “Most of the representatives in the state legislature are white men. They can’t even imagine living the reality we live – they don’t live with constant shootings, having to protect your kids from stray bullets. “We don’t yet know the scale of what we’re doing: we’re in the eye of the storm now — but I really think we’re a part of a historic moment in Brazil,” Monteiro said. Franco legacy has reached far beyond Rio: hundreds of kilometers north in the Amazon region, Vivi Reis, who is running to be a deputy in the lower house, also cites Franco as a political inspiration. “Her murder was a way of trying to shut us up, in the most brutal way, but it done the opposite of that. Now we’re screaming louder.”",885,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/brazil-sees-black-female-candidates-surge-after-of-rising-star
16,"wenty-five years ago, one of the titans of contemporary Latin American politics set off on a gruelling bus journey across Brazil to take the pulse of the region biggest democracy and hear the voices of its forgotten masses. “I’ll have a mouth like a cricket and ears like an elephant,” future president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vowed as he began a listening tour later dubbed “The Journey to the Heart of Brazil”. A quarter of a century later, with Lula in jail and Brazil facing its most unpredictable and divisive presidential election in decades, the Guardian retraced that historic expedition through seven Brazilian states to get a sense of the issues driving the vote – and what might happen when Brazil million voters go to the polls on October. Recife The journey begins in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco, Lula birthplace and the launchpad for his caravan. Brazil north-east is the second most populous region, with more than million voters. Traditionally they have been loyal to Lula, the man who still enjoys hero status here for his crusade against poverty during his presidency. Until Lula, who is now serving a sentence for corruption, was barred from running , polls showed about of voters here backed him. Matheus Henrique Santana Souza isn’t one of them. The president of a group called Direita Pernambuco (Rightwing Pernanbuco), he is one of tens of millions of conservative, and overwhelmingly male voters backing far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro who leads polls with about of the vote. “It a cultural war,” Souza, a history student, explains during an interview at a luxury oceanfront apartment in Pernambuco capital, Recife, owned by one of the group wealthy benefactors. Souza slammed Lula as a “scumbag” who, with his Workers’ party (PT) comrades, hoodwinked the Brazilian people and plunged Brazil into economic turmoil. “He a crook! A thief!” agreed another of the group members, Maxwell Cavalcanti. Polls show of north-easterners are so disgusted by Bolsonaro poisonous views on gender, race and sexuality, they would not even consider voting for him. “He a devilish goat,” sneered one voter. “A rat fever,” said another. But for Souza and many others, Bolsonaro represents deliverance from what they say is a communist cabal determined to decriminalize abortion, mollycoddle criminals, and indoctrinate students with dangerous leftist values. Further up the beach, banner-waving Bolsonaro campaigners had set up shop near Brasília Teimosa, a seaside favela known as a hotbed of Lula support. Alfeu França, a speedo-sporting bank clerk with a Brazil flag draped over his shoulders, said he voted Lula in but was now Bolsonaro to his bones. “The truth is [the PT] has become a criminal faction … at the service of evil.” Garanhuns and Iati With Lula sidelined, he is relying on his surrogate, Fernando Haddad, to derail the Bolsonaro juggernaut. But for that to happen Lula must persuade supporters to back his stand-in – and fast. Haddad has soared in polls since being confirmed as Lula replacement and now occupies second place, with of intended votes. Among Brazil south-eastern intelligentsia the former philosophy lecturer is admired for creating hundreds of miles of bike lanes while São Paulo mayor. But in Lula hometown – the official starting point of the caravan – many still have no idea who is he. “It Bada. Dada. It a funny name, isn’t it?” grinned Geraldo Alves de Araújo, a fruit-seller. “Never heard of him,” admitted Arlindo Pereria da Silva, a painter. “But Lula says it a good idea.” West along Highway on the depressed outskirts of a town called Iati, where many lack running water and some eat protected birds to survive, few though had doubts about supporting team Lula. “If Lula backs a donkey, I’ll vote for a donkey,” said Paulo da Silva, a subsistence farmer who, like many here, survives on a reais monthly welfare allowance called bolsa família that was rolled out under Lula. “Lula left this place with a full stomach,” said Maria Laurentino, a mother in Rua da Taba, a Garanhuns favela Lula visited in And Bolsonaro? “He a demon,” she replied, as her neighbours nodded in agreement. “He no good.” Delmiro Gouveia The next stretch of the caravan cuts across Brazil sertão , a scorched backcountry of cactuses and cattle carcasses long notorious as the fiefdom of ruthless oligarchs. When Lula visited, famished, cactus-eating peasants flagged down his two-coach convoy and pleaded for help. “My problem hunger, sir,” one woman told him. Lula blamed a “shameless” clique of corrupt politicians for allowing such poverty to persist. “Brazil political elite has failed,” he proclaimed, in language similar to that now being used by Bolsonaro. Twenty-five years on the hunger has receded but Lula is behind bars, and the finagling goes on. In June the former mayor of Canapi, one town Lula visited, was sentenced to years in jail for siphoning off millions in public funds. Further west, in Delmiro Gouveia, the mayor was forced from office in for misuse of public funds. “ Politics should be an art, not a business,” complained Tony Cloves, a candidate for the Socialism and Liberty party (Psol) in Delmiro who has spoken out against the thievery. That this region, like Brazil as a whole, suffers a chronic corruption problem is obvious from a billboard at the town entrance that reads: “It not politics that turns a candidate into a crook. It your vote that turns a crook into a candidate.” Cloves, known locally as the Obama do Sertão or Backlands Barack, lamented how many saw politics as a way to get rich: “We feel this everywhere from Delmiro town council to the national congress. It a corrupted system.” Cloves said powerful caciques (chiefs) continued to dominate the region politics; a vote could be bought for reais (about making it almost impossible for upstanding politicians to gain power. Meanwhile, politically driven contract killings remained common , with two councillors gunned down in recent months. 'He not perfect': why do so many Brazilians support rightwinger Jair Bolsonaro? With Brazil reeling from one of the greatest corruption scandals in world history , presidential hopefuls have vowed to purify their country politics. But such pledges have been heard before. “There so much pilfering,” said Marinita de Menezes, a housewife. “The whole lot of them should be in jail after everything they’ve stolen.” Feira de Santana Two hundred miles south down Highway it is the killing voters are worried about. Feira de Santana, Bahia state second largest city, has seen its homicide rate increase sharply , and is now one of the deadliest cities in a country where a record lives were lost last year. A duel between drug factions means scarcely a day passes without murder. Crime reporter Gleidson Santos, whose blog chronicles the bloodletting, said many were turning to Bolsonaro for hardline solutions to the violence. But Santos, a PT-voting journalist – who races to crime scenes on a motorbike adorned with a sticker of Lula and Haddad – said Bolsonaro iron fist would do nothing but accelerate the slaughter of young black men. “He not the way forwards. I’m certain of it.” Zé Neto, a local PT politician, agreed bullets were not the solution. “[We need] more education, more social projects.” But on Feira dirt-poor outskirts, there is little sign of that help arriving. “We’re totally forgotten,” complained Gisélia Miranda, the leader of one rundown favela. “The politicians only remember us when elections come around.” Two days earlier a boy had been shot dead metres from where Miranda stood – Feira murder victim this year. A T-shirt hanging from a nearby washing line carried the name of a man many see as a potential saviour: “Bolsonaro Presidente!” Teófilo Otoni Catholic social worker Maria Graciela Bartesaghi Silveira was part of the Movement for Marginalized Women when she started working with sex workers in Teófilo Otoni brothels in She has given her life to defending some of Brazil most vulnerable women and children. 'Stop this disaster': Brazilian women mobilise against 'misogynist' far-right Bolsonaro To this day she remembers the day Lula and his caravan dropped in on O Ninho, the social project she founded here beside Highway to protect the offspring of the sex workers she was supporting. “The kids loved it,” Silveira recalled. “Lula truly is a very special person … It was a joy to have him here.” Fast-forward years and that delight has been replaced with dread at what the election of Bolsonaro – who has called female rivals idiots, tramps and unworthy even of rape – might mean for Brazil and its million women. Women represent of Brazil electorate and could decide October vote. Yet many have lamented the dearth of proposals about women issues in this year race, not to mention their participation in it. Of the candidates, only two are women. Four of the election manifestos fail even to mention the word “woman”; Bolsonaro document mentions it just once. Silveira, said the lack of propositions reflected a broader lack of progress: “Women still come second. We see it on TV all the time: women being beaten, women being killed, women being raped. I think the situation has changed very little. “I just don’t understand how a woman could want to vote for Bolsonaro.” Eight-five miles further on, in the city of Governador Valadares, Cleuzenir Barbosa said she couldn’t understand why a woman wouldn’t. Millions have joined the #EleNão (#Not Him) campaign to scupper Bolsonaro bid for power but Barbosa – a black female candidate for his Social Liberal party (PSL) – denied her leader was chauvinist. “He a marvellous person,” Barbosa, a evangelical Christian, gushed. “These feminists who preach the destruction of the family and abortion … they twist Bolsonaro words.” A photo attached to the bumper of her car shows the rightwing populist flashing a Churchillian V-sign. “Brazil has spent nearly years under leftist, almost communist regime,” she said. “We can’t take any more.” Duque de Caxias, a suburb of Rio Haddad key campaign pledge has been to bring back “the good times” of Lula boom years . Few places need that more than Parque Vila Nova. A shabby, sewage-streaked shanty better known as the Favela do Lixão or the Rubbish Dump favela, the community is just miles north of Ipanema beach but feels like another world. Alessia Almeida, the residents’ association president, said most of the settlement inhabitants scraped by with the help of bolsa família . “Without it, I don’t know what would become of them,” she said. Paulo César Gomes, a longtime PT member and resident, was among those who helped organize Lula visit, hoping to showcase the forsaken community. Twenty-five years on, “we are still invisible,” complained Gomes, whose redbrick shack overlooks a black swamp of sewage. With Brazil struggling to emerge from the worst recession in its modern history, million people out of work, and extreme poverty again on the rise , Haddad commitment to “make Brazil happy again” has struck a chord in places like this. “When Lula was in power there were jobs for everyone – then the crisis came along and screwed everything,” said Eliane Oliveira, a mother-of-two. Nearby, three more young, unemployed mothers – Angela, Yasmin and Raiane – sat with their babies and said they too would back Haddad. “In Lula day, all you had to do to find a job was walk down the street. Now you walk and you walk and you walk and you find nothing,” said Raiane, jobless since Yasmin, agreed: “Lula stole but he helped like hell.” Almeida, the community leader, said she also was dreaming of a Haddad victory – and as a transgender woman she has more reason to than most. “I’m scared of what might happen if Bolsonaro gets elected,” she said, adding: “Did you know Brazil is the country that most kills LGBT ? Just imagine what will happen if this man becomes president.” São Paulo After days on the road – and at least one case of goat-meat induced food poisoning – Lula reached his final destination, São Paulo state, where he had launched an improbable political career that led to the presidency, then to prison – and which may yet hold some more surprises. Twenty-five years later, eight pretenders to Lula former throne gathered in a hilltop TV studio on the outskirts of São Paulo capital for one of the final presidential debates. For an hour and a half the candidates sparred over everything from tax policy, job creation and healthcare to Brazil “genocidal” war on drugs and the need for more women in politics. Jair Bolsonaro leads Brazil presidential race from hospital bed Two absent figures, however, towered over proceedings: Lula, forced from the race by his controversial incarceration, and Bolsonaro, confined to a hospital miles south after he was stabbed at a campaign event on September . One by one, the candidates swore to save Brazil from the toxic fissure that has opened up between those who love Lula or loathe Bolsonaro, and those who love Bolsonaro or simply loathe Lula. Ciro Gomes promised to end “this hateful confrontation that is driving our country towards violence”. Geraldo Alckmin claimed he could rescue Brazil from both the PT economic incompetence and “the candidate of discrimination”. Marina Silva, a former Lula ally and environment minister, claimed “a courageous woman” was now needed “to put the house in order”. Once the cameras were turned off, Silva lingered on stage and reflected on the state of her bitterly divided nation. “We must be very careful we aren’t left choosing between a rock and a hard place,” she said. “The rock of the PT government corruption and the hard place of authoritarianism and disrespect for democracy and women that Bolsonaro represents.” As her rivals streamed out of the auditorium, Silva insisted: “We can choose a country that is politically democratic, socially just, culturally diverse, environmentally sustainable and economically prosperous.” Similar ideals inspired Lula exhausting pilgrimage across Brazil years ago. But with Brazilian voters enraged and disillusioned and desperate for change, they seem unlikely to be the values that will decide this, the most rancorous of races for power.

17,"or decades, the New York Review of Books has enjoyed a reputation as the most important intellectual publication in the US, a home for complex and challenging ideas. Ex-New York Review of Books editor: I was 'convicted on Twitter' over essay This week, the stately magazine has been capsized after choosing to publish a highly contentious piece by the former broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi , who has been accused of sexual assault by more than women. Ghomeshi article will not be printed until October but it has already cost editor Ian Buruma his job , prompted a detailed apology from the NYRB publisher, divided the staff at its West Village office and generated a storm of criticism which has drawn in some of the biggest names in the literary world. One of the women who accused Ghomeshi of attacking her told the Guardian she was distressed by the article in which, she said, her alleged attacker tried to elicit sympathy and gave a false account of the legal process. “This is so self-absorbed that I don’t know how this could be published and not cause an outrage,” Linda Redgrave said. Ghomeshi was fired from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in after multiple complaints of harassment, which included allegations of hitting, biting and choking during sex . He was acquitted in one criminal trial and a second criminal case did not proceed after he signed a “peace bond” and gave one woman a public apology. There is an ethical line you don’t cross. I think he crossed the line Linda Redgrave In his article for the NYRB, Ghomeshi attempts to “inject nuance” into his story and says “there has indeed been enough humiliation for a lifetime” before ending his account with a “reformed character” anecdote about meeting a woman on a train. He apparently claims ethical credit by describing how he did not try to seduce her. Redgrave, who waived her right to anonymity after the first criminal trial, said of Ghomeshi article: “I had not seen this coming. I suspected that he wasn’t going to go away disgracefully, but it caught me off stride and I was really upset by it. There really wasn’t any apologising, it was trying to just evoke sympathy for something he doesn’t deserve.” After reading the piece online, she contacted Buruma and demanded to write a rebuttal. He agreed and she filed her account the day before he left the NYRB. She has since been assured that her rebuttal will be published in the October edition as part of a pledge by the magazine to devote “substantial space” to responses to the Ghomeshi article. Asked if she thought Buruma should have lost his job, Redgrave said: “Yes I do. There is an ethical line you don’t cross. I think he crossed the line. This was something he did knowing that it was going to have this result. He knew that this was wrong, he did it anyway, he deserved to be fired.” ‘Free exploration of ideas’ The article, published online earlier this month , has attracted little conspicuous public support. But the “enforced resignation” of Buruma has divided observers. The affair has also illuminated some of the most difficult questions of the moment: In the #MeToo era, can someone who faces allegations of sexual violence be rehabilitated if criminal allegations do not lead to conviction? Does public pressure from the so-called “Twitter mob” have a chilling effect on free speech? What is the duty of a publication to challenge, fact-check and counter-balance a writer first-person article, particularly when the author is accused of abusive, offensive or criminal behaviour? This week, a letter with signatories, including authors Colm Tóibín , Joyce Carol Oates and Ian McEwan, was sent to the NYRB . It said: “We find it very troubling that the public reaction to a single article, ‘Reflections from a Hashtag’ – repellent though some of us may have found this article – should have been the occasion for Ian Buruma forced resignation. “Given the principles of open intellectual debate on which the NYRB was founded, his dismissal in these circumstances strikes us as an abandonment of the central mission of the Review, which is the free exploration of ideas.” The letter was coordinated by writer and academic John Ryle and drafted and edited by a core group of contributors. A source with knowledge of how the letter was brought together said it was first distributed via email last Sunday and more than prestigious contributors to the NYRB were given hours to sign or decline. His dismissal … strikes us as an abandonment of the central mission of the Review Open letter to NYRB A second source with knowledge of the letter, who also declined to be named, said: “There was an intense process of revision. I do not know how many of the signatories think that publishing the piece was an error of judgment. The phrasing of the letter embraces those who do think this and those who do not. “It affirms that, either way, the signatories do not think that there was a justification for summary dismissal … this is a difficult situation, with strong feelings on all sides. But it is clear to me that an injustice has been done to Ian Buruma.” Buruma, and described to the Guardian by one supporter as “a terrific public intellectual”, claimed in an interview with the Dutch magazine VN he had been “convicted on Twitter, without any due process”. He said be felt compelled to resign, after just over a year in post. The letter from authors and writers in support of him was made public the day after a detailed statement was released by the NYRB publisher, Rea Hederman, rejecting the allegation that public outcry alone was responsible for Buruma departure. “We acknowledge our failures in the presentation and editing of his story,” Hederman said, citing editorial lapses including a failure to bring female members of staff into the editing process. “We surely had a duty to acknowledge the point of view of the women who complained of Mr Ghomeshi behaviour.” The publisher statement said many of the editorial staff objected to Buruma claim in two interviews that staff came together after initial objections to the piece. “Finally, it is inaccurate that Ian Buruma departure was the result of a ‘Twitter mob’,” the statement said. “In fact before his departure, the mob mostly had moved on.” ‘I believe the women’ The Guardian contacted a number of the signatories to the supportive letter. Joyce Carol Oates said by email she totally agreed with critics of Ghomeshi essay, but said: “I thought that terminating Mr Buruma contract so abruptly was not a good, or necessary decision. Mr Buruma (whom I don’t know) is a distinguished critic, writer, editor who is certainly to be defined by far more than a single misstep. We would all wish to be given a second chance.” Free speech: why editors can no longer publish and be damned | Emily Bell Fintan O’Toole, literary editor of the Irish Times, who signed the letter, said the published piece was very poor and Buruma should not have said that the truth of the allegations was not his concern. “So the issue for me isn’t whether he was right or wrong – to me he was clearly wrong. It whether one bad incident justifies the sacking of an editor who is very widely agreed to have been doing a very fine job. If editors are sacked the first time they make a mistake, we’ll end up with nobody in charge of vitally important publications except ultra-cautious hacks.” The rights and wrongs of the piece and Buruma fate split other commentators. Rebecca Solnit , author of Men Explain Things To Me, said: “There are two things that are really outrageous. The first is to give a platform to somebody who appears to have so violated the rights of others and the rights, the dignity, the safety of the bodies of other human beings. “And the second is to violate all normal editorial standards not only to publish a piece that profoundly dishonest and misleading about what happened but to also, according to reports, deny the longtime women editors the rights to have a look at it.” It treats what he has to say as important and true and what [his accusers] have to say as unimportant and irrelevant Rebecca Solnit She added: “I believe the women who made allegations against Ghomeshi and to lose their voices out of the story and let him tell the stories in ways that contradict what they told us: it treats what he has to say as important and true and treats what they have to say as unimportant and irrelevant.” Gerald Howard , an executive editor at publisher Doubleday, said the NYRB was “immensely important to American intellectual life, which always feels on the edge of disappearing”, but publishing the article was an editorial misfire. “It was not adequate to the case. I can see exactly why people are upset about it, I don’t think he [Ghomeshi] remotely came to terms with what he did and why he found himself in the situation that he did. It substandard without any question.” But Howard said of the enforced resignation of Buruma: “I really disapprove. I feel that he was taken down by a mob and did not deserve it. “The thing that especially upsets me is that apparently there was all this pressure from university presses who said they were going to withdraw their ads from the Review because of publishing this piece, which just makes steam come out of my ears.” Jay Rosen, who teaches journalism at NYU and writes the blog PressThink , said: “A piece that was that provocative and was going to be looked at very closely, because it unusual for the New York Review to do something like that, it just needed to be more solid than it was.” Acclaimed authors pen letter in protest at 'forced resignation' of Ian Buruma He said it would be a tragedy if the NYRB was to begin shying away from publishing controversial subjects, “but it is not clear that what happened. It a valid concern about ideas being shouted down on social media and publishers not wanting the cost of that. I’m not saying it relevant to this piece but it is something to worry about – it good that writers are worried about that.” Speaking on background because they were not authorised to comment publicly, a member of NYRB staff said most co-workers were relieved the editor had gone, having been concerned about some of his decisions. In an editorial meeting, objections were raised about the Ghomeshi piece: about its tone and style, about its lack of insight and about the way it misrepresented the allegations against him. After publication, the source said, some staff expressed longstanding concerns to the publisher. It was distressing Buruma departure had become a free-speech issue, the source added, saying it was really about managerial and editorial shortcomings.",1842,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/new-york-review-of-book-ian-buruma-jian-ghomeshi
18,"Saudi Arabia foreign minister has demanded Canada stop treating it like a “banana republic” and called upon the government of Justin Trudeau to apologize for calling for the release of jailed human rights activists, further escalating a simmering diplomatic row that began over the summer . “You can criticize us about human rights, women rights … that your right. You can sit down and talk about it, but demand the immediate release? What are we, a banana republic? Would any country accept it?” said the foreign minister, Adel Al-Juebir, at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, as world leaders gathered forthe United Nations general assembly. Al-Juebirreferenced a tweet sent by Canada foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, calling for the release of jailed activists Samar Badawi and her brother, Raif Badawi. Raif Badawi wife and children are Canadian citizens. It was a separate tweet of the same content, but translated into Arabic and sent by the Canadian embassy in Riyadh, that in August prompted a wave of anger from the Saudi government, culminating in the expulsion of Canadian diplomats, the near-cessation of trade and the removal of all Saudi medical students from Canadian universities. In his comments on Wednesday, Al-Juebir also attempted to return the criticism, alluding to issues of separatism in French-speaking Quebec and Canada treatment of indigenous communities. A tweet, then a trade freeze: latest row shows Saudi Arabia is asserting new rules “It is outrageous, from our perspective, that a country will sit there and lecture us and make demands – we demand the immediate release. Really? We demand the immediate independence of Quebec. We demand the immediate granting of equal rights to Canadian Indians,” he said. “We don’t want to be a political football in Canada domestic politics. Find another ball to play with.

19,"Pope Francis has defrocked the Chilean priest at the center of the global sex abuse scandal rocking his papacy, invoking his “supreme” authority to stiffen a sentence originally handed down by a Vatican court in Vatican signs historic deal with China – but critics denounce sellout In a statement on Friday, the Vatican said Francis had defrocked the Rev Fernando Karadima, who was originally sanctioned to live a lifetime of “penance and prayer” for having sexually abused minors in the upscale Santiago parish he ran . The “penance and prayer” sanction has been the Vatican punishment of choice for elderly priests convicted of raping and molesting children. It has long been criticized by victims as too soft and essentially an all-expenses-paid retirement. The Vatican did not say what new evidence, if any, prompted Francis to re-evaluate Karadima sanction and impose what clergy consider to be the equivalent of a death sentence. It said Francis made the “exceptional decision” for the good of the church, and cited the church canon that lays out the pope “supreme, full, immediate and universal power” to serve the church. The statement said the decree, signed on Thursday, takes effect immediately and that Karadima was informed of it on Friday. The decision appeared aimed at showing a get-tough approach to sex abuse after a series of missteps by Francis and accusations by a former Vatican ambassador that Francis had rehabilitated a now-disgraced former American cardinal early on in his papacy. While the move will be welcomed by Chilean victims as overdue, the decision could spark a religious debate for those who see it as a second punishment for the same crime. Francis conservative critics might also bristle at another display of raw papal power from the Argentinian Jesuit. Francis sparked a crisis in his papacy earlier this year when he strongly defended one of Karadima proteges, Bishop Juan Barros , against accusations that he had witnessed Karadima abuse and ignored it. Francis had claimed that the accusations against Barros were “calumny” and politically motivated, and he defended his decision to appoint Barros bishop of a small Chilean diocese over the objections of the faithful and many in the Chilean hierarchy. After realizing that something was amiss, Francis ordered a Vatican investigation that uncovered decades of abuse and cover-ups by the Chilean church leadership. Francis apologized to the victims and set about making amends, including getting every active bishop in Chile to offer to resign. To date, he has accepted seven of the more than resignations offered, including that of Barros. Pope tells Sicily mafia 'You cannot believe in God and be mafiosi' Pollsters have cited the Karadima scandal, which first erupted in as the tipping point in the Chilean church progressive loss of credibility among ordinary Chileans. Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of Karadima abuse who has been a key driver in pushing for justice for victims and an overhaul of the Chilean hierarchy, thanked Francis for taking action against Karadima. “I never thought I’d see this day,” Cruz tweeted. “I hope many survivors feel a bit of relief today.”",514,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/28/fernando-karadima-pope-francis-defrocks-chile
20,"A mob of about people in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo doused a detective with gasoline and burned him to death, according to local officials. The Hidalgo state prosecutors’ office said the crowd attacked local police in the town of Metepec on Thursday and took the detective and three other men captive. They severely beat the men and burned the detective after dousing him with fuel. It was unclear if he was on duty or if they knew he was a detective. Video posted on social media sites showed a mob kicking one of the men in the town square and beating him with cudgels and fists. Police eventually arrived to rescue him and two others. The mob was reportedly roused by rumors that the men were planning to abduct children. The prosecutors’ office said it was investigating and would bring the killers and other members of the mob to justice. “Let it be clear, inciting or promoting these kind of acts is also a crime,” the office said. In similar cases, prosecutors have been able to identify and arrest suspects because townspeople often record attacks on their cellphones and post videos online. There have been five killings in the span of about a month in Mexico based on false rumors about child snatchers. In four of those cases, the victims were also burned. Authorities say the rumors circulate on social media and have asked the public not to believe them. It is not the first time that investigative agents have been killed in Mexico after townspeople caught them snooping around.

21,"orge Cobos follows the remnants of an Inca road down the eastern slopes of Peru Andes, through cloud forest and over swaying plank bridges, edging along narrow paths beside sheer drops. Finally, after a four-day trek, he clears a patch of undergrowth with his machete, revealing a moss-covered wall. Thick roots are entwined around fallen lintels. Elsewhere, the stonework is still daubed with orange plaster. Largest known child sacrifice site discovered in Peru “Imagine – there are lots of buildings left to discover in the forest,” he said. “And beyond, in the mountains: who knows?” The sprawling ruins are, scholars agree, the last capital of Vilcabamba: a holdout Inca state that resisted for decades after the conquistadors landed in Peru in executed the emperor Atahualpa, and occupied the Inca capital of Cusco. Forgotten for centuries, the city of Espíritu Pampa – also known as Old Vilcabamba – has only been cleared in recent decades. And the latest findings, a new site museum and fieldwork both scheduled for – along with the pending completion of a road through Vilcabamba – are bringing attention to the last stronghold of the Incas once more. Architect and explorer Vincent Lee first mapped out Espíritu Pampa in detail in the when the region was under the control of brutal Shining Path guerrillas . “It was a step back into the century just to go there – and a potentially dangerous one,” he said. The jungle “was so thick one could hardly see one building from the next,” Lee added. Today, three government workers use machetes to keep the foliage at bay from a palace compound, the remains of a huge hall with doorways, and a labyrinth of rooms, streets and stairways. “The area is fascinating because it still hasn’t been disturbed or looted. The information is firsthand,” said Javier Fonseca, an archaeologist with Peru ministry of culture. “It the last capital of Inca resistance,” he added. “It has history, it has archaeology, it has everything. It genuinely a marvel to work in this place.” Four successive Incas ruled in Vilcabamba, venerating the sun, engaging in diplomacy and guerrilla warfare with the Spanish – and inspiring rebellions beyond their mountain refuge. Facing an overwhelming invasion in the Incas set the city ablaze and fled into the forest. The Spanish captured Peru last indigenous monarch Túpac Amaru I and executed him in Cusco, bringing the Inca empire to an end. Espíritu Pampa was swallowed up by the jungle. Yet recent research points to a far older origin for the site – and to a web of connections linking Vilcabamba with its European and indigenous neighbours. Archaeologists Brian Bauer and Miriam Araoz have documented metal nails, roof tiles and pairs of scissors. Their excavations have shed further light on Yuraq Rumi – a monumental rock expertly carved with steps, shelves and bulges, centrepiece of an Inca shrine near Vitcos. In one sector of Espiritú Pampa – dominated by towering matapalo trees that grip the ruins – Fonseca pieced together a unique ceramic vessel depicting Andean and Amazonian peoples, backed up by jaguars, united in battling the mounted conquistadors. Perhaps the most intriguing discoveries at Espíritu Pampa concern the Wari – a predecessor culture to the Inca that ruled swaths of Peru between and In Fonseca identified a sumptuous Wari burial complex near the main site. One occupant – dubbed the Lord of Wari – was found with a silver mask, breastplate, axe blades and ornaments, golden bracelets and dozens of finely crafted vessels. And late in Fonseca identified a Wari temple nearby, containing both Inca and Wari gold and silverwork. “This society doesn’t disappear overnight. Part of the Wari inheritance survives, thanks to the Incas,” he argued. These cross-cultural finds are currently divided between minor exhibits and storage units, Fonseca lamented, but there are plans to build a museum in Vilcabamba in The Cobos family would like to see it established in Huancacalle, the small village by Vitcos from where explorers have long set out on foot for Espíritu Pampa. But some fear this buccaneering tradition is coming to a close. Archaeologists are currently mapping the Inca path – to avoid any damage from a highway due to be extended into the valley below. Peru royal pedigree: direct descendants trace roots to Incan emperor and kin The new road is eagerly awaited by some Vilcabamba residents, mainly Quechua-speaking smallholders who barter potatoes, yuca, coffee and cuy (guinea pigs) to get by. Even if it becomes more accessible, the last city of the Incas will still inspire wonder, and new techniques such as Lidar mapping may soon reveal the true extent of the city beneath the forest canopy. “I’m sure there a great deal more to uncover,” said writer and explorer Hugh Thomson. Benjamín Cobos, agreed. As a boy, the Machiguenga peoples that lived at Espíritu Pampa told him of yet another city, even deeper in the forest. “They said you have to walk for five days, along a wide Inca road,” he added. He once followed a barefoot indigenous guide, scrambling up densely wooded slopes for hours. “But, because I didn’t care about ruins then, I turned back.”",860,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/28/perus-last-incan-city-reveals-its-secrets-its-genuinely-a-marvel
22,"Canadians have long prided themselves as a nation of outdoors people, taking advantage of their free time to paddle, climb or hike across the country vast and rugged landscape. But the results of new study throw cold water on this notion: a typical Canadian is more likely to spend their leisure time cuddled up in front of a television. The study, released on Thursday by the Nature Conservancy of Canada found a growing detachment between Canadians and the great outdoors. Nearly of respondents said they felt happier and healthier when in nature. But three-quarters said they found it much easier to stay inside, and lamented that they no longer spent as much time outside as they once did. Television wasn’t the only reason Canadian aren’t out in nature as much: many pointed to rain, snow and insects as deterrents from venturing outside. Most of the respondents extolled the benefits they gained from venturing outdoors, including feelings of happiness and reduced stress – and even reduced blood pressure. Half of Canada monitored wildlife is in decline, major study finds Despite the fact that the number of national and provincial parks is increasing, the survey also found that of Canadians feared that nature might not be available to future generations. “It time to talk boldly about the tangible benefits nature provides, and the urgency and importance of protecting it,” Nature Conservancy president John Lounds said in a statement. The Nature Conservancy report, administered by polling firm Ipsos Reid, comes as the organization seeks to double its projected land and water to hectares acres). Canada currently has hectares acres) of forest, according to Natural Resources Canada, making up nearly one-tenth of the world forests.

23,"A former Mexican state governor has pleaded guilty to charges of criminal association and money laundering, after presiding over an administration whose thuggery and excesses outraged the public – and eventually proved too embarrassing for his political allies. Javier Duarte, was accused of embezzling millions in state money, which he used to buy a string of artworks and luxury properties. During his administration, the Gulf coast region of Veracruz became one of Mexico most dangerous, most censored and most indebted states . Mexico elections cast light on governors – and state systems built on corruption On Wednesday, he was sentenced to nine years in prison and fined pesos State authorities have seized properties and cash worth around but Duarte will not have to pay any damages, and could be freed in as little as three years, according to press reports. During Duarte term of office, Veracruz was consumed by a string of atrocities as drug cartels battled for territory amid widespread allegations of official collusion with organized crime. Thousands of people disappeared; hundreds of bodies were later found buried in a series of clandestine mass graves; at least journalists were murdered. As the violence escalated, Duarte appeared unmoved by the plight of victims’ families, and instead blamed reports of bloodshed on his political rivals. “He was the worst governor in the history of Veracruz – and we’ve had bad governors,” said Noé Zavaleta, the Veracruz correspondent for the newsweekly Proceso. Zavaleta predecessor, Regina Martínez, was murdered in In Zavaleta attended five funerals for murdered colleagues and said that for journalists, the period was like “living with a boot on your neck”. Media workers were threatened, filmed and intimidated; at one point Duarte own security detail manhandled a photographer at an event to celebrate freedom of speech. Allegations of graft dogged Duarte administration from the start, including revelations that the state health secretariat had given watered-down medicines to child cancer patients. An exposé by the online news organisation Animal Politico and anti-graft group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity in showed how Duarte close collaborators embezzled billions of pesos of government money into shell companies. Duarte relatively light prison sentence prompted anger in Veracruz. “Once again the justice system is mocking society,” said Zavaleta. “Behind all this money laundering and illicit enrichment are dismantled hospitals in Veracruz, unpaid scholarships, pensioners who died because they couldn’t pay for their medicines, the disappeared persons because we lived in a state of anarchy.” “Duarte got off easily, without doubt,” said Luis Pérez de Acha, a lawyer in Mexico City. “In terms of prison and his wealth? Very easily.” Shortly before his term was due to end in Duarte fled Veracruz in a government helicopter. He was eventually detained in Guatemala in April and extradited to Mexico. Meanwhile, his wife, Karime Macías, has been accused of living a life of luxury in central London. Mexico: wife of captured ex-governor living high life in London, rival alleges Outgoing president Enrique Peña Nieto once hailed Duarte as part of a wave of young governors who would modernise Mexico and renew the venerable Institution Revolutionary party (PRI). Instead, Duarte became a poster child for political corruption; the PRI, which for many years turned a blind eye to graft, eventually used Duarte arrest as proof that it was finally getting tough on wrongdoing Peña Nieto, who leaves office December with record-low approval ratings, abided Duarte excesses until the PRI suffered unprecedented defeats in June local ellections, losing control of several states including Veracruz, where the party wielded power for years. But Duarte remained true to his party allegiance to the bitter end: at his sentencing on Wednesday, he said: “I am still a soldier of the president; I am loyal to him.”",622,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/javier-duarte-mexico-veracruz-guilty-sentenced-corruption
24,"The book topping Argentina bestseller list is not a thriller or a murder mystery. It a crime story of another sort: a blockbuster about political corruption that suggests that bribery is an integral part of the country body politic. “The reality of corruption in Argentina surpasses fiction,” said Hugo Alconada Mon, an investigative journalist and the author of The Root of All Evil, which was published just as the country was shaken by a wave of graft allegations against senior politicians across the ideological spectrum. The cases include allegations of bags of cash delivered to former president Cristina Fernández, as well as a plot to allegedly launder under-the-counter contributions to the electoral campaigns of the centre-right party of her successor, Mauricio Macri. Alconada argues that so many of Argentina foremost politicians, judges, journalists and business people are involved in corruption, that it has become impossible to get anything done without it. “Corruption is no longer an alternative way of conducting business or politics in Argentina – it is the main structure of power, one that has been in place for decades for the benefit of a chosen few,” he said in an interview. Argentina: ex-president Cristina Fernández charged in bribery scandal The scale of the problem has been hammered home over recent months, with the arrest of a string of high-profile figures, including former vice-president Amado Boudou, former public works minister Julio de Vido and a number of lower-ranking officials who allegedly acted as middlemen. Last week, Fernández herself was indicted on bribery charges, accused of receiving sacks stuffed with millions of dollars from construction companies during her presidency and that of her husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner. According to the indictment by federal judge Claudio Bonadío, some of the cash was delivered at the couple Buenos Aires apartment or buried in farmland in southern Argentina. Fernández has denied all wrongdoing, saying in a statement: “They can follow my movements and those of my family, listen clandestinely to my telephone conversations or dig up all of Patagonia or wherever else they see fit, but they will never find anything involving me – because I have never taken illicit money.” On the other side of the political divide, Macri Cambiemos party is under investigation for allegedly stealing the identities of people to launder illegal campaign contributions. In three separate cases, the courts are investigating some fake contributors to Macri presidential campaign and fake contributions to the midterm elections in Buenos Aires province. “They stole the names and ID numbers of social welfare recipients, people living below the poverty line, made them fake members of Cambiemos and passed them off as campaign contributors,” says Juan Amorín, a journalist for El Destape website, which discovered the illegal maneouvre. As a sitting senator, Fernández remains immune from arrest; Macri has not been named as a suspect in the identity theft cases. Operation Car Wash: The biggest corruption scandal ever? But the allegations have electrified Argentina at a time when authorities across Latin America are struggling to confront corruption. The recent spate of arrests – and the indictment of Fernández – were triggered after La Nación newspaper obtained handwritten notebooks in which a chauffeur at the public works ministry had detailed his participation in a huge kickback scheme that allegedly flourished under the Kirchner and Fernández governments. For more than a decade, Óscar Centeno kept records in a set of spiral-bound notebooks, logging the collection of bribes from businessmen who had won government contracts – and their delivery to government officials. Under Argentina plea bargain law, many of those involved struck deals with Judge Bonadío, and implicated others. But few corruption trials make it to court in Argentina, and those that do often drag out so long that the statue of limitations comes into effect before sentencing. According to Alconada book, only of corruption cases that made it to the federal courts in recent years have produced convictions. “In every country there always some dishonest official who runs off with public money,” he says. “But in Argentina what you have is professionalized, institutional corruption across the entire business sector, all political parties and all areas of government, including the judicial branch.” “The level of sophistication of corruption in Argentina is amazing and alarming,” he says. “It so bad that I am even scared my book will be used more as a guide for corruption than as a warning against it.”",735,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/argentina-corruption-book-cristina-fernandez
25,"t was on Wednesday when Jair Bolsonaro fired off his first tweet of the day from what must rank as one of the most unusual campaign headquarters in political history. “While they insist on fallacies, labels and this fixation with the word ‘dictatorship’, more than million people are unemployed, citizens are held hostage in their own homes, there are homicides and women are being raped each year,” declared the far-right frontrunner to become Brazil next president. “This is what the people care about! It urgent!” Sixty-eight minutes later, at a second, salvo emerged from the fifth floor of one of Brazil most exclusive hospitals. Stephen Fry begs Brazilians not to vote for far-right Bolsonaro “We want to rescue our long-lost values and get Brazil out of this swamp of violence and corruption they have put us in!” Bolsonaro told his million Twitter followers. “Our country can’t take another four years [of this].” They were just the latest Trumpian dispatches to emerge from São Paulo Israelita Albert Einstein hospital, where Bolsonaro has been staying after being stabbed on the campaign trail on September. When the rightwing populist was attacked – almost one month to the day before the October vote – analysts and relatives alike predicted it would turbo-charge his bid for the leadership of Latin America largest country. Fast-forward nearly three weeks and those predictions have largely come true. Bolsonaro continues to top polls with about of the vote, compared with the of his closest rival, Fernando Haddad from the Workers’ party (PT) of jailed former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “As disastrous as it was for him personally … politically it was quite good for him,” said Brian Winter, a Brazil expert and the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly. “I don’t believe the stabbing caused his support to grow per se. I think what happened was that his loyal base of supporters hardened. Their narrative of ‘everybody is against us’ was reinforced,” Winter added. But the assassination attempt, which left Bolsonaro on the brink of death and needing life-saving surgery, had also “inoculated” him from negative attacks at precisely the moment opponents had needed to lay siege to his campaign. Winter said Bolsonaro main rightwing rival, Geraldo Alckmin, had intended to spend the last stretch of the campaign “just destroying him” in the media – “and because of the attack they couldn’t do it”. Bolsonaro, in contrast, appears to have played his political cards wisely since the stabbing, transforming his enforced exile from on-the-ground campaigning into a reality TV-style spectacle that has guaranteed him a place on Brazil front pages, day after day. Unable to take to the streets, he has made his final campaign pitches to Brazil million voters in Twitter posts and videos, Facebook live streams and, most recently, a tearful interview in which he urged viewers to ditch Lula PT and take a chance on him. “I know you are very disappointed with politics. But this is your chance,” Bolsonaro, whose hair had been especially trimmed by a hospital coiffeur, told his bedside interrogator. On Wednesday morning six television cameras were trained on the entrance to the hospital and a dozen Brazilian journalists milled around outside waiting for the arrival of family or friends, or an update on Bolsonaro condition. A politically-connected family of three – who did not want to be named for fear for upsetting allies at a sensitive political moment – sat catching some sun on a bench outside the hospital, where one of them was recovering from major surgery. “I’m crazy to see him,” enthused the patriarch, a wealthy Brazilian businessman with ties to Alckmin Social Democracy party (PSDB), who declared that his whole family was now on Bolsonaro side. Why? “We’re worried about this place turning into a Venezuela,” his wife said. The couple daughter nodded in agreement: “We know what the PT did [to Brazil] ... the economy, the corruption and their whole philosophy about just pleasing the poor. “Our first choice was Alckmin. He has no charisma but he competent,” she continued. But with polls showing that Bolsonaro was the only candidate capable of stopping Haddad though, throwing their support behind him was a no-brainer. “I’m betting on him now,” the patriach said. Inside, where one employee said guards and eight federal police agents were watching over Bolsonaro, the candidate was preparing to fire off his latest tweet: a link to his YouTube channel where he boasts nearly subscribers. “God willing, from next year we will, together, change the destiny of Brazil ,” he said in one recent pronouncement. The patriarch said he was desperately hoping Bolsonaro was right. “The experience we had with the PT was awful,” he complained. “They distribute poverty to the many, and give wealth to the few.”",793,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/jair-bolsonaro-brazils-far-right-presidential-frontrunner-campaigns-from-hospital-bed
26,"Argentina has received the biggest loan package ever from the International Monetary Fund, aimed at shoring up the country ailing finances: a whopping that will be disbursed over the next three years. “This is the biggest loan in the history of the IMF,” said the fund director, Christine Lagarde, on Wednesday as the final loan agreement was announced in New York. The loan – of which has already been received by Argentina – comes with stringent conditions, including a commitment to a zero deficit for Argentina had initially secured n in a deal worked out in June after the South American country was battered by a currency crisis, a run on the peso and double-digit inflation. The economy minister, Nicolás Dujovne, said that at the last minute the IMF agreed to increase the lending package by Lagarde said that as part of the deal, Argentina central bank had agreed to intervene in currency markets only in case of extreme circumstances and that the new amount would help Argentina government face its challenges. The agreement will only allow Argentina central bank to intervene to stabilize its currency if the peso depreciates below pesos to the dollar. It is currently at pesos to the dollar after losing of its value since the start of the year. The deal was announced just a day after the president of Argentina central bank, Nicolás Caputo, resigned unexpectedly, reportedly after disagreements with the IMF guideline limiting the bank future intervention to rescue the peso. Thousands of Argentinians joined in a nationwide strike on Tuesday to protest against economic turmoil and Mauricio Macri austerity measures. Most Argentinians blame the international lending institution for encouraging policies that led to the country worst economic crisis, in which pushed millions into poverty.

27,"The British actor and comedian Stephen Fry has made an emotional plea for Brazilians not to vote for the far-right frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro in the country looming presidential election. Fry interviewed Bolsonaro , then a congressman, in for his BBC program Out There, a series about homophobia around the world. The interview gained notoriety in Brazil and has resurfaced during the most polarized election campaign in recent history. In a video posted by BuzzFeed Brasil , Fry said Bolsonaro discourse against people of color, women and the LGBT community is “genuinely terrifying”. He called his encounter with the candidate, who is leading in the polls, “one of the most chilling confrontations I’ve ever had with a human being”. Although Bolsonaro, a former army officer, once said that to have a gay son or daughter was “equal to death”, he told a female lawmaker who called him a rapist that he would not rape her because she did not “deserve to be raped” and has argued that Brazil brutal military dictatorship should have killed more dissidents. Fry said his intention was not to tell Brazilians how to vote, but asked them to reflect on what it means to be Brazilian. He encouraged viewers to think about Brazil multiculturalism, as seen in the music, food, celebrations and the multiracial makeup. He said this “wonderful mixture” does not reflect a “strange, Trumpian belief that there is one Brazilian race, one ethnicity, one political and religious Brazil”. “Does [Bolsonaro] want to be Emperor Maximilian?” Fry questioned. “He lives in a fantasy world of militarism, which I find deeply upsetting and frightening.” The video has nearly combined views between Facebook and Twitter and drew varied reactions on Brazilian social media. “This guy says he loves Brazil , but where does he live?” questioned one Twitter user. “He doesn’t know that our other options are much worse,” reflecting how many Brazilians turn to Bolsonaro as a supposed alternative to the corrupt political establishment. 'He not perfect': why do so many Brazilians support rightwinger Jair Bolsonaro? “Wow, a chilling analysis,” wrote one Facebook user. “Not just because he English, but he captured exactly the essence of what we are going through here. Fear is indeed the word!” “One of the most courageous and emotional testimonies I have seen recently,” commented a Facebook user. “I watched the interview he did with Bolsonaro and you can see he uncomfortable.” In their encounter, Fry challenges Bolsonaro for trying to block a law that criminalizes homophobia and puts an anti-homophobia lesson into public school curriculum. Bolsonaro says in response that the law stimulates homosexuality. “They want to reach our children in order to turn the children into gay adults to satisfy their sexuality in the future,” he says. “We’re thinking about having a heterosexual pride day,” Bolsonaro said to Fry. “You won’t be invited.”",473,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/stephen-fry-jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election-out-there-interview
28,"akia Wardak family has been fractured and diminished by long decades of war in Afghanistan. Soviet forces killed her father four decades ago, Americans seized and tortured her husband two decades later and her brother was murdered in the capital this past summer. Yet, somehow, she has not abandoned hope. Relatives abroad begged her to join them after the latest killing. Instead, convinced that Afghanistan can still change, that the peaceful country of her childhood memories can be reclaimed, she has taken a tentative step into the dangerous, notoriously corrupt arena of Afghan politics, running for a seat in parliament. “There a lot of injustice going on, particularly affecting the younger generation,” said Wardak, a successful engineer who virtually shuttered her business several years ago to focus on health and women rights. “If you have a seat in parliament, you can raise people voices.” The odds are stacked against her. It is still not clear if the October vote – widely seen as a trial run for an even more high-stakes presidential poll next spring – will go ahead. The election is already more than three years overdue and mired in controversy. Some opposition leaders want further delays so that biometric checks on voter identity can be brought in. Officials have already quietly dropped plans for a vote in one key province, eastern Ghazni, without bothering to inform voters or provide an explanation. If the poll does take place elsewhere, voters and candidates alike would be targets for militant attacks, and the results would almost certainly be skewed by serious corruption. “If it a clean vote I think I will be one of the winners, but I am concerned about what happens on election day,” Wardak said at campaign headquarters. “There is a lot of money involved, a lot of rich candidates and people who have different types of support.” Yet she is not alone in her conviction that democracy, though embattled, can still work in Afghanistan and a fight against powerful vested interests can be won. She is part of a wave of candidates, mostly young professionals and entrepreneurs, running in defiance of security concerns and long, bitter experience of parliament as graft-ridden and ineffective. Many came of age after the Taliban were toppled in including the entrepreneur Hamed Warasta. “It time in Afghanistan for the younger generation to do something,” he said, in the headquarters of the conglomerate he built up after a childhood as an impoverished refugee, which supplies everything from printing paper to military uniforms. “At some point we have to stop just relying on our own elders. It the moment for us to prove ourselves to them and the nation.” The election comes at a difficult time. The country has been convulsed by waves of extreme violence, with deaths of civilians setting grim records this year and so many soldiers killed that security forces casualties are now classified information . The Taliban control more territory than at any time since they were ousted from power, and threaten swaths of the country beyond their main bases. In August militants rampaged for days through Ghazni city , only miles from Kabul, as the central government seemed paralysed by indecision and incompetence. Meanwhile, Islamic State has spread its murderous sectarian violence into a country that had been spared at least that one poison amid its other miseries. Although there is more focus on peace talks than there has been for many years – from both Afghans and their US backers, and the Taliban – efforts have slowed as elections draw closer. The Taliban have less incentive to deal with an administration that may be replaced in months and negotiations are a gamble for officials facing an election. That threat of violence makes campaigning hard. Given that bombers have recently targeted schools and sports clubs , rallies are a huge risk both to candidates and those attending. Venues and security are also expensive in a city where candidates are vying for fewer than seats. So Wardak, who describes her campaign as “grassroots activism”, aims to meet influential community figures in small groups and has organised volunteers to reach out to their peers. “To reach people I talk to them face to face and tell them what I have done,” she said. “I also have a big crowd of young people who knock on doors with my biography to discuss my campaign, a group of elders who go to the mosque and say I am the right candidate, and professionals who speak to other professionals.” Looming over all the confusion and fears for the parliamentary vote is next year presidential election. President Ashraf Ghani took power in a controversial compromise cobbled together after a poll marred by widespread allegations of fraud. No one expects a clean fight this spring, with control of the country at stake. Afghanistan is already one of the most corrupt countries in the world, according to Transparency International, and power brokers hoping to gain or hang on to lucrative positions will throw huge sums at the campaigns. A new voter registration system suggests spending has already begun, with the numbers signing up to vote “too good to be true”, according to the Afghanistan Analysts Network thinktank, which picked through statistics from the new electoral roll. Among the suspicious details were an unprecedented enthusiasm for voting in conservative areas where turnout has traditionally been low and many registration centres could not open because of violence. “Several of the highest rates of registration can be found in some of the most insecure provinces,” the analyst Scott Worden wrote. “Four – Paktia, Nimruz, Nangarhar and Nuristan – saw more than of their estimated eligible voters registering.” Still, western countries funding the elections insist both the parliamentary and presidential polls will happen. Without elections that donors can claim are credible, the flow of foreign military support and aid funds that sustain the Afghan government may falter. “Everyone agrees they are not going to be perfect,” said one senior diplomat. “But I think they will be better than people expect.” It would be easy to describe the coming year as critical for Afghanistan. It is an adjective overused for many years by foreigners who dropped in on brief military and diplomatic tours as troop numbers swelled then were cut back down. In reality, the country has long lived on the brink of catastrophe. “I hate this phrase ‘critical period’. Since my first memories, things have always been very sensitive [in Afghanistan],” said a former Afghan security official. Conflict has plagued the country since and the violence is exacerbated by poverty, illiteracy, industrial-scale opium production and widespread addiction. The civil war has gone through so many iterations that there are few enemies that have not been allies in the past, or allies that were not once enemies. The US once embraced the mujahideen as freedom fighters when they battled the Soviets; now their Taliban heirs are waging a fierce jihad against American forces. Meanwhile, Russia stands accused of arming the insurgency, though it denies funding militants. While those cycles of violence have often bred despair, history may also serve as a spur towards peace. The US is weary of a war that is now its longest ever, and its western allies now also accept that – despite overwhelming advantages of money and technology – they must talk to the Taliban. “The main issue is that no one is going to win this militarily,” said one senior western diplomat. Seventeen years after the first US soldiers invaded Afghanistan, this might seem like stating the obvious, but it was barely five years ago that Barack Obama claimed America war in Afganistan was “over” , and David Cameron declared “mission accomplished” . 'Isis will be looking for targets': guns and fear mark Afghan Ashura As the Afghan government grapples with shrinking territory and America growing impatience, senior officials have also made greater overtures to insurgents, declaring a unilateral ceasefire that prompted the Taliban to respond in kind over Eid. The first official break in fighting since was hugely popular. For three days Taliban foot soldiers flooded into cities for ice-cream and selfies and urbanites with government links returned to homes in insurgent-controlled areas that had been off limits for years. It showed that the Taliban could control its fighters and that ordinary people on both sides were desperate for the fighting to stop. Now they just have to hope they can get through the elections safe, and with a leadership – whether new or renewed – that can build on the promise of those brief, heady days.",1432,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/zakia-wardak-afghanistan-young-politicians-democracy-elections
29,"Indonesia geophysics agency lifted a tsunami warning minutes after issuing it following a major earthquake that sent huge waves crashing into the north-eastern coast of Sulawesi island. The quake and tsunami , which hit the city of Palu, about miles) from Jakarta and further along the coastline, has killed at least people. Officials said on Saturday the death toll was likely to rise significantly. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their death. The geophysics agency, BMKG, faced criticism on Saturday on social media, with many debating the timing of the tsunami warning. The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to “end” the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around from Palu. Indonesia tsunami: death toll could rise into the thousands, vice-president warns “We have no observation data at Palu. So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that,” said Rahmat Triyono, head of the earthquakes and tsunami centre at BMKG. He said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in the sea level, only recorded an “insignificant” wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu. “If we had a tide gauge or proper data in Palu, of course it would have been better. This is something we must evaluate for the future,” said Triyono. It was not clear whether the tsunami, which officials say hammered Palu and the surrounding area at extremely high speeds measuring in the hundreds of kilometres per hour, occurred before or after the warning had been lifted. “Based on the videos circulating on social media, we estimate the tsunami happened before the warning officially ended,” Triyono said. Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at the University of Oxford, said it was “surprising” the quake had generated a tsunami. Sulawesi tsunami devastates coast in Indonesia – in pictures Friday quake was recorded as a “strike-slip” event where neighbouring tectonic plates move horizontally against each other, rather than vertically, which is what usually generates a tsunami. “There is some speculation that there was a landslide under the sea, which displaced a lot of water and caused the tsunami,” he said, adding the Palu narrow bay may have concentrated the force of the waves as they moved toward the shore. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster agency, told reporters his team had been “preparing to send public warnings that were easy to understand” when the tsunami warning was “suddenly ended”. The communications ministry said repeated warnings were sent out to residents via text message, but Nugroho said the quake had brought down the area power and communications lines and there were no sirens along the coast. Indonesians took to social media to question the BMKG move to lift the tsunami warning and a failure to release information in a timely manner. “So upset ... the warning was lifted ... although a tsunami happened,” said Twitter user @zanoguccy in a direct message to BMKG.",517,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/indonesias-geophysics-agency-under-fire-for-lifting-tsunami-warning
30,"A powerful earthquake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami has killed at least people, with Indonesia vice-president, Jusuf Kalla, warning the death toll could rise into the thousands. Kalla said there had been “no word” yet about casualties in the Sulawesi city of Donggala, home to people. The Red Cross said in a statement that the situation was “extremely worrying”. “We’re now getting limited communications about the destruction in Palu city, but we have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying.” Athonius Gunawan Agung, an air traffic controller who jumped off a tower roof as it was collapsing while waving out the last flight from Palu airport on Friday night, was one of the first casualties of the disaster. The broke several bones, including an arm and a leg as he jumped off the tower. His employers sent a helicopter to take him to another city for treatment, but he died minutes before it arrived. The earthquake struck Palu, on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, just before dusk on Friday, wreaking havoc and destruction across the city and triggering a deadly tsunami on its coast. In the city of Palu, home to at least people have already been confirmed dead, with more than injured. The quake destroyed thousands of homes in the city, as well as an eight-storey hotel, hospital and a large department store. The damage has been described as extensive: a main highway was cut off by a landslide and a large bridge washed away by the tsunami wave, which hit Palu Talise beach and the coastal town of Donggala. The tsunami wave reportedly reached as high as metres, and as it approached land was travelling up to “The tsunami didn’t come by itself,” said Indonesia disaster agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. “It dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land.” Indonesia geophysics agency (BMKG) has faced criticism over its handling of a tsunami warning issued after the earthquake was detected. The agency lifted its tsunami warning minutes after it was first issued following the earthquake based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around km miles) from Palu. “We have no observation data at Palu. So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that,” said Rahmat Triyono, head of the earthquakes and tsunami centre at BMKG. On Saturday morning as residents awoke to the destruction, with some areas entirely flattened – a horizon of scattered wood, debris and corrugated iron roofs – people have been desperately trying to find their missing relatives. A Facebook page for information on Palu city has become a pop-up ledger for missing persons, with family members posting pictures of their missing children, wives, fathers and grandparents, in the hope that someone will find them. Of the almost dead, emergency teams have only identifed In the aftermath of the disaster, phone communications and seven power stations were knocked out, although on Saturday morning the state electricity company had recovered power at two plants. With limited communications, it has been impossible for authorities to determine the full extent of the damage or death toll, especially in the coastal town of Donggala, population “Donggala is still unreachable because communications are still cut off,” disaster spokesperson Sutopo, told reporters on Saturday afternoon. Sutopo said bodies of people killed by the tsunami had been found on the shores of local beaches, but there is yet to be an official tally. Early witness reports said that people had been killed on Talise beach in Palu. “Many corpses are scattered on the beach and floating on the surface of the sea,” one local resident, Nining, told kompas.com . Photos shared on social media showed bodies being lined up on a shoreline, their faces covered in cloth. Authorities have warned the extent of the tragedy could worsen in the coming days, as more information from currently disconnected areas comes to light. Hundreds of people planning to attend a beach festival who are now missing, may be among the rising toll. “When the [tsunami] threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run – and they became victims,” Sutopo said Amateur footage that has gone viral on Indonesian social media shows a huge wave hitting the coastline, engulfing the roofs of houses as it crashes into the city, and floods into a nearby mosque. Search and rescue teams have been deployed to the worst-affected areas, with authorities saying that military transport planes and helicopters would be deployed along with “all national potential”. About army and police officers have also been dispatched to assist in the emergency response. The military has also started sending in cargo planes with aid, authorities said, from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities. As of Saturday evening, more than people had been displaced, evacuating to centres in Palu. Indonesia president, Joko Widodo, is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday. Indonesia disaster agency is working to restore electricity and communications, as well as address urgent needs, such as the provision of medical treatment, temporary housing and basic supplies such as food and water. Sulawesi tsunami devastates coast in Indonesia – in pictures Palu airport also sustained damage to its control tower and runway.

31,"North Korea needs more trust in the US and the developing relationship between the two countries before it will abandon its nuclear weapons, Pyongyang top diplomat said on Saturday. 'All the time in the world': Trump says no rush for North Korea to denuclearise More than three months after a summit in Singapore, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly Pyongyang does not see a “corresponding response” from Washington to its early disarmament moves. Instead, he said, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping up pressure. “The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant of us,” Ri said, adding that continued sanctions are “deepening our mistrust” and deadlocking diplomacy. “Without any trust in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said, adding that the North commitment to disarming is “solid and firm” but that trust is crucial. Washington is wary of easing sanctions or agreeing to another of the North priorities, a declaration ending the Korean war, without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves. Ri comments come as Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo , are trying to regain momentum in their quest to get North Korea to renounce its nuclear ambitions. Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit. Both Kim and Trump want to meet again. But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety. Pompeo and Ri met on the sidelines of the general assembly on Wednesday for what Pompeo described as a “very positive” discussion. He did not give any details. The North has traditionally said that the nuclear standoff is between it and the US, but recent summits between Kim and South Korean president Moon Jae-in have also dealt with the nuclear issue. Nuclear envoys from the US and South Korea have met three times during this week UN meetings to talk about ways to end North Korea pursuit of an arsenal of nuclear-armed long-range missiles.",378,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-trust-us
32,"Sir Keir Starmer , the shadow Brexit secretary, will fly out to Taiwan this weekend to lobby against the death penalty in an initiative also aimed at demonstrating the UK continued commitment to international legal standards following the EU referendum. His four-day trip, which is supported by the Foreign Office, will include meetings with the country vice-president, minister of justice and senior judiciary. There are more than prisoners on death row in the republic. Starmer, who was formerly director of public prosecutions, has for many years been a director of the Death Penalty Project, which campaigns for abolition of capital punishment across the world. According to Amnesty International latest estimates, countries have stopped imposing capital punishment in law and practice out of more than states globally. Asia remains one region where the death penalty is still widely used. Taiwan adopted a moratorium on using the death penalty but on August, Lee Hung-chi, who was convicted of murdering his ex-wife and daughter, was shot through the heart from behind – the country routine method for carrying out executions. Starmer, who visited Taiwan two years ago, told the Guardian: “The most important thing is to ensure that the moratorium stays in place. One of the most important points to emphasise after the referendum is the UK continued commitment to international law … across the world. “For me personally, and the country, compliance with international human rights obligations has always been central and I have devoted much of my career to that cause ... Going to Taiwan is part of maintaining the UK commitment to international human rights.” Saul Lehrfreund, a solicitor at the London law firm Simons Muirhead &amp; Burton and co-founder of the Death Penalty Project, is accompanying Starmer to Taiwan. He said: “We will be raising the case of Lee. Taiwan has not said it will abolish the death penalty tomorrow, but has stated that it a long-term objective.” Lehrfreund has also been to talk to authorities in China about the death penalty. Chinese executions have declined in number: years ago as many prisoners were being killed every year. The current figure is believed to be roughly executions. “The reality is that miscarriages of justice are inevitable anywhere in the world. An individual on death row in Taiwan was exonerated recently after spending years on death row.” The UK commitment to opposing the death penalty has been questioned since the government signalled in July that it may allow two terror suspects, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, who have been detained in Iraq, to be extradited to the US, where they could face the death penalty. The Foreign Office said: “It is a longstanding policy of the UK government to oppose the death penalty, in all circumstances, as a matter of principle.” The department said it worked closely, through the Magna Carta Fund, with abolitionist organisations such as the Death Penalty Project to reduce the number of executions and restrict use of the death penalty. Asked about the Isis suspects, the spokesperson said: “We are clear that any foreign fighters who may be captured in an armed conflict should be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law and brought to justice in accordance with legal due process.” Starmer is due to return to the UK on Thursday after the end of the Conservative party conference. In an article he and Lehfreund have written for Taiwanese papers, they said: “The global experience shows that support for capital punishment dwindles after abolition as the punishment comes to be outdated. “There are many unanswered questions about Lee death that make it sit so uncomfortably with a commitment towards abolition, including that his original sentence of life imprisonment was increased to death on appeal, the lingering and serious concerns as to Lee mental health and his apparent unwillingness to appeal or seek clemency … It has been made repeatedly clear that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",697,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/keir-starmer-visits-taiwan-to-lobby-against-death-penalty
33,"It was seven in the morning when he felt the jolt. His wooden hut, tethered to the sea floor, had been lurching ominously as heavy winds whipped up the waves around it. He thought he had felt the anchor rope break, but he wasn’t sure until he saw that the hut had moved – unnerving confirmation that he was adrift in the ocean. Aldi Novel Adilang, picked up his walkie-talkie and radioed a message to his friends. “Phone the boss,” he told them over the crackly connection. “My anchor has snapped.” Employed on floating fishing huts known locally as rompong , Aldi and his friends would often spend months at a time out at sea, miles from the Indonesian shore. Their job each night was to light the lamps strung around the huts to lure fish to the traps below. To cope with the isolation they would amuse each other by telling jokes and stories over their walkie-talkies. There was no phone signal, but on rompong less than five miles apart the radios worked. In the two years that Aldi, from the island of Sulawesi, had been doing the job, his anchor had broken twice before, so when it happened again on July he didn’t immediately panic. He had no idea he was about to embark on a tumultuous ordeal in which he would survive off raw tuna, rainwater and, at the lowest point, by sipping seawater through his clothes. “On the first day I was OK, I wasn’t stressed or panicking. I knew they would send a boat but I was worried it would have to turn back because the winds and the waves were strong,” he told the Guardian. “It was after more than a week that I started to get very scared.” Aldi said he had about a month worth of supplies – rice, spices, coconut oil, fuel for the generator and a drum of fresh water – when the anchor broke. In the first weeks, he would busy himself by fishing – mostly catching tuna – scanning the horizon for boats and singing gospel songs. Initially he would boil or grill his catch, and when the gas ran out he started to burn bits of wood from the hut so he could cook. In the end he just ate it raw. As he floated thousands of miles away from home across the Pacific Ocean, Aldi drew up a calendar in his notebook, marking off the days so he didn’t lose track of time. As the days of endless horizon dragged on, he grew increasingly desperate. “There were times when I crying and thinking about killing myself,” he said. “When I was crying the only consolation I had was reading the Bible.” He worked his way through the books of Matthew, John, Isaiah, Genesis and Psalms. Matthew chapter verse the opening of the Lord prayer, particularly stuck in his mind. Without a compass or GPS, Aldi had no idea where he was or how long he might be there. “The hardest thing was the thought that I would never see my parents again,” he said, twisting his shirt around his hands. “That I would never see my island again, and never make it home alive.” Aldi had taken the rompong job at the age of before he even knew how to swim. At the time he thought his monthly salary of rupiah was decent, but it didn’t seem worth it as he drifted in the ocean, an existence punctuated by soul-crushing moments. The first came a few weeks in when an Indonesian ship sailed by. Aldi managed to talk to the captain by walkie-talkie, who promised they would turn around and get him after finishing work for the day. They didn’t return. Polite and soft-spoken, Aldi showed no anger at the recollection. Flown into Jakarta to appear on a national talkshow, his first time in the capital, he seemed somewhat bewildered by all the attention – or perhaps it was just the fact he had survived. One of the worst parts of the ordeal – scarier than the sharks that regularly circled his hut – was when he ran out of water. Aldi survived by dipping his shirt into the ocean and sipping the seawater through the cloth, in the hope that it would reduce the amount of salt he would consume. He lived like that for four days, until finally it rained. That saw him through to day when he was rescued by a Panamanian-flagged vessel, MV Arpeggio. “When I saw the boat I was waving my towel at them in the air and over the radio I was saying ‘help, help’ because I knew that word in English,” Aldi said. “The ship had already passed by me, about one mile, but then they turned around and picked me up.” Video shot from the ship shows Aldi small hut bobbing in the ocean, and the weakened teenager being hauled up a wooden ladder on to the deck, where the crew rushes to bring him a blanket and fresh water. Onboard, he later told his story to the crew via Google Translate. The boat was heading to Japan, so the ship captain made arrangements for Indonesian embassy officials to pick up Aldi in Tokuyama, almost two months after his nightmare had begun. On the train to Tokyo, he made a long-awaited video call home. “We were crying so much the officials from the embassy cut the call short,” Aldi said with a laugh. “They said you cannot be noisy like that on a train in Japan.” With the adventure behind him, Aldi said he would be staying on land. For now he is just grateful to be turning another year older. On Sunday, he will celebrate his birthday.",961,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/28/indonesian-teenagers-ocean-ordeal-after-a-week-i-started-to-get-scared
34,"President Rodrigo Duterte has admitted for the first time to authorising extrajudicial killings as part of his war on drugs in the Philippines. Duterte made the admission during a speech at the presidential palace on Thursday, where he directly challenged anyone who criticised how he ran the country. “I told the military, what is my fault? Did I steal even one peso?” said Duterte. “My only sin is the extrajudicial killings.” Duterte has previously addressed the existence of extra-judicial killings but has always denied they were state-sponsored. This direct acknowledgment of his role in the deaths could give further weight to the ongoing preliminary investigation by the international criminal court (ICC) into the thousands of extrajudicial killings carried out as part of Duterte “war on drugs”. Duterte Harry drugs war: how one family was destroyed In March, the ICC confirmed it was investigating allegations Duterte had committed crimes against humanity in his brutal anti-drugs crusade, both as mayor of Davao and then as the president over the past two years. In response, the president announced he was withdrawing the Philippines from the Rome Statute, which gives the ICC jurisdiction to investigate the country. According to official statistics, people, mostly small-time drug dealers and addicts, have been killed by the police in what have been described as “legitimate” anti-drug operations since Duterte became president. However, the report submitted to the ICC alleged the death toll was more than with some rights groups estimating it is as high as Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said: “This admission should erase any doubt about the culpability of the president.” The president spokesman, Harry Roque, said on Friday morning that Duterte comments had been “playful” and should “not be taken literally”. Duterte also used the speech to emphasise he had no intention of ending his war on drugs any time soon. “It will not end,” he said. “As I have said, I will put on the table my life, the presidency.

35,"Pastor Jin Mingri has felt firsthand the pain of one of Chinese president Xi Jinping harshest crackdowns on religion in years. Jin Zion Church in Beijing, one of the biggest unofficial congregations in the country, was abruptly demolished by authorities this month, who then sent him a bill for yuan for the related costs. Jin had preached there every Sunday for decades. “Before, as long as you didn’t meddle in politics the government left you alone,” he said. “But now if you don’t push the Communist party line, if you don’t display your love for the party, you are a target. “Of course we’re scared, we’re in China , but we have Jesus.” Zion belonged to a vast network of unofficial “house” churches that function outside of the government mandated system, and for decades were tolerated by authorities. They have long been vulnerable, but have become more vulnerable as China leaders call for the “Sinicisation” of religious practice. New regulations that came in in February require tighter control of places of worship, with some forced to install CCTV cameras that fed live footage to local authorities. In the months that followed, officials across China have removed crosses from church buildings and demolished others perceived as too large in the hope of reducing the public visibility of religion. The crackdown comes as the Vatican and Beijing signed a provisional agreement last week that would give the Pope a say in the appointment of bishops in China, an issue that has long caused friction between the two. As part of the deal the pope will recognise seven Chinese bishops who were appointed unilaterally by Beijing and had been excommunicated by the Vatican. But some even within the church have called the arrangement “an incredible betrayal” of underground Catholics who have remained faithful to Rome despite facing potential repercussions . At the same time, an estimated million Muslims have been detained in “re-education” camps in Xinjiang province. The measures ultimately have the same goal: to give Beijing tighter control over groups officials see as a potential threat to their grip on power. Bob Fu, founder of the religious rights group ChinaAid, said Chinese officials were trying to shrink both the official and unofficial branches of the church. He said he had received reports of dozens of rural village chiefs forcing residents to sign papers denouncing Christianity , lest they lose state welfare benefits. The Guardian view on Xinjiang: China secret camps are at last in the spotlight | Editorial But Fu said the church would survive. “I have hope for the future, these campaigns were done in Roman times, under Stalin and under Mao, and none succeeded,” he said. “It will only have the opposite effect, and if Communist party cadres studied history they would see this. Crackdowns will cause the church to grow faster, and help church be more united.” ‘Burning Bibles, destroying churches, and jailing Muslims’ US lawmakers held a hearing this week on “China war on Christianity and other faiths”, and focused extensively on the crackdown on house churches and the agreement between Beijing and the Vatican. Chris Smith, a US congressman who led the hearing, accused China of “taking a hammr and sickle to the cross”. “Burning Bibles, destroying churches, and jailing Muslims by the million is only part of the Chinese Communist Party audaciously repressive assault on conscience and religion,” he said. For decades after the Communist revolution in believers in any religion were harshly persecuted as Mao Zedong pursued his socialist dream. In China adopted a new constitution that technically guaranteed freedom of religion, but it has not stopped authorities from shutting churches, demanding patriotic loyalty from pastors and imams and even dictating how the faithful can pray. Even while religions were technically allowed to exist – there are million Christians in China – the constitution says “religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination”, a key hurdle for the Catholic church. China limits the number of officially sanctioned religions to five: Buddhism, Taoism, Protestantism, Catholicism and Islam. Pamela Kyle Crossley, a history professor at Dartmouth College in the US, warned that the Vatican agreement could be just the first step in an escalating series of demands and said the church was being naive in its negotiations with Beijing. “If the Vatican is willing to give the [Communist party] the right to appoint amenable bishops in China, the [Communist party] will soon point out that it has a distinct interest in promoting amenable bishops in many parts of Asia, and certainly in Africa, probably in Latin America, and very possibly in Italy itself,” she wrote in a recent blog post . “Where Chinese investment goes, [Communist party] interest in acquiescence and harmony follow. Nobody advises on turning the other cheek or handing over your cloak with your tunic like the Church.”",808,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/28/we-are-scared-but-we-have-jesus-china-and-its-war-on-christianity
36,"Like clockwork, the approach of winter in Delhi brings steadily worsening pollution levels in the city. It also heralds elaborate, sometimes hare-brained schemes to fix the problem. Last year, the Indian capital tried showering the city with water from helicopters; but the aircraft were unable to fly in smog. When authorities used “smog cannons” to blast polluted streets with mist, air quality in those areas declined . In October, environmental officials in the city will roll out the latest weapon in their war on pollution: more than outdoor air purifiers at intersections on major roads. Delhi air pollution is now so bad it is literally off the chart Tests in Mumbai showed the devices cut air pollution by about one-third, but only in the surrounding metres. The units in Delhi will be more powerful, but experts are sceptical. “It is like trying to air condition a room with the roof off,” says Alistair Lewis, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York. “There is very little evidence they make a difference to concentrations of pollution.” The outdoor purifiers are “a distraction”, says Anumita Roychowdhury, an executive director at the Delhi-based centre for science and environment. “We are saying, focus on the real action of cutting pollution at the source.” And quietly, Delhi is doing just that, she says. In the past two years, central and state governments, as well as the country supreme court, have pushed through a range of policies to curb the dust, fumes and carcinogenic smoke that blankets the city year-round and grows more acute during winter months. Nobody believes the air quality this winter will be good, but it could be better than the past two years – the worst on record. “Reform processes have been set in motion,” Roychowdhury says. “If they are taken forward, then we can see a silver lining.” Results are already being seen, officials say. Monitoring stations show this year is cleaner so far than the past two. Last year winter was also marginally better than thanks to a graded-action plan that gradually bans sources of pollution such as coal-power plants and construction activity as the air quality declines. “Because these things happened, the number of days with severe pollution levels were less than the previous winter,” Roychowdhury says. At a monitoring station in the heart of Delhi old city, researchers are grappling with just how deadly the atmosphere has become. The facility is one of three in India that can measure pollution particles as small as micro-metre – more than a hundred times thinner than a strand of human hair. “These are the finest particles we are inhaling and can get deep inside the lungs,” says Gufran Beig, a joint director at the Indian institute of tropical meteorology, who oversees research at the stations. The pollutants, labelled are so poorly understood that the World Health Organisation does not know how much exposure, if any, is safe. But the pollutants are likely from the most toxic sources: they is especially thick near traffic or heavy industry. The stations are already changing the way smog in India is understood. Research has revealed the pollution in Mumbai, though less dense than in Delhi, contains more particles. The air in the financial hub may could be deadlier than previously known. “Although the mass concentration of pollutants in Mumbai is less compared to Delhi, the toxicity is more,” Beig says. Sharp spikes in Delhi pollution often come from dust storms blowing in from the Gulf. But the city also exudes extraordinary quantities of car exhaust, construction dust and smoke, especially during the Hindu festival Diwali, when millions of firecrackers can be exploded in a single night. A raft of policies have been implemented in the past year to plug these pollution sources. Emissions standards for cars are being tightened more quickly. Imports of pet coke, a dirty fuel the US was accused of dumping in India, have been banned. The city last remaining thermal coal power plant will be permanently shut next month. Air pollution causes ‘huge’ reduction in intelligence, study reveals As is often the case in India, actually implementing the new policies will be a challenge. But they give the city a path forward, Roychowdhury says. “There is no reason why we can’t bend the curve, if these things take off.” As the winter approaches and the air quality falls, those who can afford to do so are investing heavily in air purifiers. The American Embassy School, in the city leafy diplomatic enclave, has spent more than in the past four years on nearly air purification units on its campus. “We can get the air down to a level you could use in a hospital operating room,” says Jim Laney, the school director. Nearly air monitors are arrayed throughout the school and can warn when the air quality suddenly drops. “So if a teacher leaves a door or window open, we will see a spike in air quality and we can go and investigate it,” he says. Children less frequently play outdoors, the younger ones especially encouraged to spend their recess in new indoor play areas. But the school has not been able to completely insulate students from the city around them. “We are restricted in, for example, putting a bubble over a soccer field or playground under the New Delhi municipal council regulations,” Laney says. At north Delhi Queen Mary school, like the vast majority in Delhi, air purifiers are out of reach. When smog worsens, some kids wear masks in class. Little else can be done but hope authorities make progress against poisonous air. “We do our best to educate them, but they are living in Delhi,” says Rachel Rao, a coordinator at the school. “They can only breathe the air around them.”",964,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/outdoor-air-purifiers-and-inside-play-delhi-gears-up-for-annual-pollution-fight
37,"Prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has appealed to Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to pardon two Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar , saying the Nobel peace laureate held the key to their release.

Reuters reporters jailed for seven years in Myanmar Clooney said the reporters were arrested in an attempt by Myanmar to keep Reuters from publishing a story on the extrajudicial killings of Rohingya men and boys. She noted that Suu Kyi had once “allowed young people to hope for a free Myanmar that respected the rule of law”. “She knows that mass murder is not a state secret and that exposing it doesn’t turn a journalist into a spy,” Clooney said of Suu Kyi. “She has said that one political prisoner is one too many, and so we’re hopeful that since these are the principles that she herself has espoused, she will step in and try to correct an injustice in this case.” About Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh amid a brutal military campaign in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.

She said their families have asked the government for the pardon, which would have to be granted by the country president in consultation with Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi has rejected criticism over the show-trial conviction earlier this month. “The case has been held in open court,” Suu Kyi said. “If anyone feels there has been a miscarriage of justice, I would like them to point it out.” An email seeking comment from Myanmar mission to the UN wasn’t immediately answered. Stephen Adler, the president and editor-in-chief of Reuters, said his reporters’ arrest “was clearly aimed at unmasking Reuters sources and keeping us from publishing the account of the massacre.” He called the attack on the reporters “a chilling warning” to other journalists worldwide. Canadian MPs vote to strip Aung San Suu Kyi of honorary citizenship “We know about the massacre because they did what good reporters do,” Adler said. “Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo went with open minds and left with facts. Except they didn’t really get to leave, did they? Only the facts did. In an astonishing miscarriage of justice, our reporters were set up and arrested.” Rohingya Muslims have long been treated as outsiders in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since effectively rendering them stateless. The discussion Friday was arranged by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which also highlighted the repression and abuse of reporters in countries including Bangladesh, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan.

38,"India supreme court has ruled against a ban on girls and women of menstruating age from entering a prominent Hindu temple in southern Kerala state, upholding rights to equality of worship. The authorities at the Sabarimala temple, which attracts tens of millions of pilgrims every year, have said the ban on women and girls aged from to was essential to the rites related to the temple chief deity, Ayyappan, who is considered eternally celibate, and were rooted in a centuries-old tradition. In the supreme court judgment, the country chief justice, Dipak Misra, said: “Restrictions put by Sabarimala temple can’t be held as essential religious practice. “No physiological and biological factor can be given legitimacy if it does not pass the test of conditionality.” Stating that society needs to undergo a perceptual shift, Misra said: “Patriarchy in religion cannot be permitted to trump over elements of pure devotion borne out of faith and the freedom to practise and profess one religion.” The ruling is the latest in a series of landmark judgments by India top court this month, involving some of the most sensitive issues in Indian society. On Thursday, the court struck down a colonial-era law that criminalised adultery , a day after imposing stringent new limits on how information on the database of the world largest biometric identity card programme can be used. Earlier this month, it scrapped a law that criminalised homosexuality , sparking celebrations across India and elsewhere in south Asia, where activists hope to push for similar reform. The supreme court has been called into action because of a significant rise in public interest litigation in recent years after heal-dragging by successive Indian governments on decisions relating to social issues.

39,"Israeli forces have killed seven Palestinians, two of them children, and shot more than others in one of the bloodiest days of a six-month protest movement along the frontier, the Gaza health ministry said. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled strip said Nasser Mosabeh, and Mohammed al-Houm, were hit by sniper fire near the perimeter fence that surrounds one side of the sq mile coastal enclave. Israel army said around people had gathered at multiple sites along the frontier. “The rioters sabotaged security infrastructure, attempted to cross the security fence and infiltrate into Israel in several locations and hurled over (improvised explosive devices) and grenades towards IDF troops and the security fence,” the Israel Defence Forces said in a statement on Saturday. It said no IDF injuries were reported. Troops “responded with riot dispersal means and operated in accordance with standard operating procedures”,the army said. Israeli aircraft also bombed two Hamas positions in response. Palestinians have protested weekly since March in what they call the “Great March of Return”, demanding that Arabs who fled or were expelled around the time of Israel creation in to be allowed to return to their homes. Demonstrators have also focused on a crippling decade-long Israeli-Egyptian blockade that has trapped much of the strip population and devastated its economy. Israeli attacks have killed more than people, the majority by bullets but also bombings. Children, medics and journalists have been shot, often as they stand far back from the fence. One Israeli soldier has been shot dead. During the past two weeks, the Hamas-led Friday rallies have grown in size and also moved to evenings and night-time, a move protesters say is to save lives as people can move under the cover of darkness. Piles of tyres have also been burnt to obscure the snipers vision. The international aid group Doctors Without Borders says it had treated more than patients with gunshot wounds, of whom were hit in the lower limbs, since the protest began. The youngest patient treated was seven years old, the group said in an email. Nearly half of those shot had fractures and some injuries included severely splintered bones. “The threat of life-long disabilities for these patients is getting bigger as time goes on,” it said. Israel says its actions are focused on preventing people from entering its territory and accuses Hamas of using the mass rallies to stage attacks. On Friday, it said several Palestinians had breached the fence but immediately returned. The World Bank warned on Tuesday that Gaza economy is in “freefall” . It cited the blockade as a factor but also economic sanctions from Hamas political rival, the Palestinian Authority, and a steep reduction in international aid, particularly from the Trump administration. It said unemployment was now more than and higher than among Gaza youth. “A combination of war, isolation, and internal rivalries has left Gaza in a crippling economic state and exacerbated the human distress,” said Marina Wes, the World Bank director for the region.

40,"An Egyptian woman who made a video alleging sexual harassment has been given two years in prison and a fine on charges of “spreading false news”. Amal Fathy, an actor and a former activist, uploaded a video to her Facebook account in May detailing how she was sexually harassed during a visit to her bank and criticising the government failure to protect women . Two days after the post, Egyptian security forces entered her home in a pre-dawn raid and arrested her along with her husband and young son, both of whom were later released. Fathy was subsequently put on trial accused of spreading false news with intent to harm the Egyptian state and possessing “indecent material”. She was sentenced to one year in prison for each charge, and given a fine of Egyptian pounds for making “public insults”. In a second trial that is under way, she faces allegations that include being a member of a terrorist organisation. In a UN survey in of Egyptian women reported that they had experienced some form of sexual harassment . Cairo was described as the “most dangerous megacity in the world for women” in a Thom son Reuters Foundation poll . Mohamed Lotfy, Fathy husband and the head of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms – who was barred from the courthouse during sentencing, said: “The sentencing is an appalling verdict that contains a message for every harasser, that he is free to harass without fearing punishment, and to every victim of harassment that if she speaks out, she will be jailed.” Amnesty International also condemned the sentence . “This is an outrageous case of injustice, where the survivor is sentenced while the abuser remains at large,” said Najia Bounaim, its North Africa campaigns director. “She is a human rights defender and sexual harassment survivor who told her truth to the world and highlighted the vital issue of women safety in Egypt . She is not a criminal and should not be punished for her bravery.” Other women who have attempted to publicly discuss their experiences of harassment in Egypt have faced similar treatment. Mona el-Mazbouh, a Lebanese tourist who recorded a comparable video during her stay in Egypt, was arrested at Cairo airport and sentenced to eight years in prison in July, accused of “spreading false rumours that would harm society, attacking religion and public indecency”. Her sentence was later reduced to one year and then suspended, before she was deported to Lebanon in September.

Officers said they were investigating driver culpability following the incident in Salalah, close to the border with Yemen. A British man is understood to be in a stable condition in hospital after being injured in the crash, which happened on Thursday. Investigators are looking into whether the driver had a licence, and a post on social media from the Royal Oman police said initial conclusions indicated “the cause of the accident [was] the driver deviation from the track”. Oman tourism ministry said: “It is with deep regret that [we have] learned of the accident that took place near the market in Salalah, which affected three British citizens and resulted in the death of two ladies, while a gentleman was injured and is in a stable condition. “The ministry would like to express its deepest condolences to the families of the two victims of this tragic and painful accident, and it wishes the injured a speedy recovery and a safe return to his home country. “The ministry is liaising closely with all relevant authorities in order to provide assistance whenever needed.” The identity of the victims and how long they have been in Oman for is not yet known. Thousands of Britons visit Oman every year, and the Foreign Office says most visits are trouble-free. But the department warns: “You should maintain a high level of security awareness and take care in public places and on the roads. “Driving standards in Oman are not always as disciplined as those in the UK, and the rate of traffic accidents in Oman is significantly higher.”",287,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/two-british-women-die-in-oman-after-car-veers-off-road
42,"Every day the war in Yemen goes on “is a day that a mother loses their child”, the UN envoy to the country has said as he announced a plan to restart peace talks. The scheme would introduce a set of confidence-building measures within a week, including reopening Sana’a airport, prisoner swaps and payment of civil service salaries. It was arranged by the UN special envoy Martin Griffiths after a frenetic round of meetings in New York designed to prevent Yemen from sliding towards a humanitarian disaster as fighting escalates. Griffiths said he was optimistic that overlapping steps could be agreed by Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led coalition that includes the United Arab Emirates and that backs the UN-recognised government of Yemen. He said: “There is a huge appetite for this. Both sides reconfirmed to me their desire to be reconvened, and they both recognise that there is no other solution to this war apart from through this process. We are now working on ways to get them back together as soon as possible.” He said as many as prisoners on either side needed to be exchanged. Sana’a airport is blocked by the Saudis. Griffiths said the confidence-building measures had been due to be discussed at talks in Geneva a fortnight ago that did not in the end take place. He said there was no need for the two sides to be in the same building for the measures to be agreed. The talks in Geneva would have been the first between the two sides for two years, but the Houthis refused to travel from Yemen after seeking assurances about the safe passage of some of its wounded soldiers. Griffiths admitted he had no power to demand a ceasefire or prevent the Saudi coalition from pressing ahead with plans to capture the strategic Red Sea port of Hodeida, through which most humanitarian aid into the country flows. “What I won’t do is to make stopping the war a condition for us to resolve it,” he said. In the wake of the collapse of the Geneva talks, the UAE announced plans to restart the military action. In a letter to the UN security council on September, it said: “The Houthis would not have engaged with the special envoy unless there was a fear of losing access to the Red Sea along with the supply of weapons and funds that sustain them. The capture of Hodeida is critical to re-engaging the Houthis in peace talks.” Aid agencies in New York urged the Gulf states not to press ahead with plans to besiege the city or to cut off the aid supply, including to the Houthi-held capital, Sana’a. The UK, which advises Saudi Arabia on military and political strategy, says it has been calling for restraint. In a sign of the complex diplomatic cross-currents over Yemen, EU states including the UK clashed with Saudi Arabia on Friday by backing a one-year extension of the mandate for an independent group of experts set up to investigate breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen. In a report in August that was rejected by the Saudi-backed Yemeni government, the experts said they had found widespread breaches of the law and said the predominant responsibility for deaths lay with the Saudi coalition. Huge spike in Yemen violence as civilian deaths rise by in four months At a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council, the mandate to renew the experts’ work was passed by votes to eight, with abstentions. The Gulf states and China opposed the move, while the UK said the humanitarian situation and human rights in Yemen were deteriorating. The UK said: “It is important to give the group of eminent experts more time to fully examine the conflict and to ensure that their conclusions accurately reflect the conduct of all parties in future reporting. It is clear that many incidents and alleged violations committed by all parties have not yet been fully documented, particularly those committed by Houthis.” The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, met the Saudi and UAE foreign ministers on Thursday, in part to discuss the humanitarian crisis and to stress the need for a political solution. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said a fund set aside to rebuild Yemen would be doubled to due to the scale of the conflict. He said Saudi Arabia had lost “the communications battle at the beginning of the war and that is why our reputation has taken a big hit”.",752,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/28/un-envoy-announces-plan-to-restart-yemen-peace-talks
43,"t Miksalište refugee centre in central Belgrade, young asylum seekers are queueing up to get a free haircut. The room is packed with newcomers, connecting their phones to plug extensions and wifi; elsewhere, two people are playing table tennis. Some have just arrived from the Middle East and north Africa, others have been sleeping rough in the nearby Park Luka Ćelović, known locally as Afghani Park. But unusually in Serbia – a gateway to the EU – it is Iranians who make up significant numbers of new arrivals. Last year, Serbia became the first country in mainland Europe to offer Iranians visa-free travel. Hostels and apartments are full to the roof thanks to Iranian tourists. In Knez Mihailova, Belgrade pedestrian zone, Farsi is frequently heard. However, many Iranians are not taking their return flights. Planes arrive full and leave empty. They are driven to the west partly because of economic hardship, exacerbated by Donald Trump new sanctions that have sent Iran currency, the rial, into a tailspin. Soroush Rahmani, arrived in Serbia four months ago. He was using a leave period from his refugee camp to sleep rough in the capital, gearing up for his overnight “game” – to try to enter the EU. Tonight would be his ninth attempt. Like other refugees, Rahmani has deposited with a money exchange bureau to pay for his passage. This will only be released to his smuggler once he has called to confirm he has successfully reached Italy. “Iran was like hell,” he says. “I prefer to sleep in cardboard here rather than live in Iran .” US ready to drive Iranian oil exports to zero, says US national security adviser Hungary tough border security means Rahmani will attempt to enter the EU through Croatia. Many refugees first cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the longer border gives them a better chance. Bosnian media reported recently that the number of Iranians seeking asylum in the country this year (up until September) stood at compared to Iranians in the whole of last year. “Every time a refugee plays ‘the game’ they are putting their lives at risk,” but some see no legal alternative, says Milena Timotijevic from the International Rescue Committee. “They are at the mercy of unscrupulous smugglers and human traffickers; they are frequently pushed back, violently, by border guards; they are subjected to ‘survival sex’ and other forms of sexual abuse. And yet they never stop trying.” Hasan Kameli was arrested by Hungarian police during his last game. They released him in the Serbian border town of Subotica, but only after days in jail, where he says he was beaten. “I lost my hope about the future of living in Iran. I sold my motorbike, which was all I had, to come here,” said the who has a motorcycle tattoo on his right leg. “You can’t live in Iran anymore, you can just remain alive there, there is no future in Iran.” Gordan Paunovic, the director of the NGO Info Park, said the number of Iranians arriving was growing fast. “You immediately recognise Iranians,” he said. “You see Syrians, Afghans they all look poor. Suddenly you see a group of kids with backpacks, who look like they’re on the school excursion … You look at them and you give them a smile and you get so many smiles back. “Everyone who comes [from Iran] is either LGBT, or Christian or politically oppressed, or was fighting in Syria for Assad and decided to leave because they didn’t like it.” Most Iranians arrive on one of the two flights a week that land in Serbia. At Info Park, the Guardian met an Iranian couple with a son and a daughter who had arrived by plane four days earlier and were inquiring about seeking asylum. The daughter – a bright student just a year before her crucial university exam in Tehran, was the only one speaking English. She was clearly anxious about her father decision to stay, asking how long it would take her to go to school in Serbia. Serbia tourism minister, Rasim Ljajić, who is trying to promote tourism by abolishing visa requirements, said that in the first seven months of this year, Iranians visited Serbia. More than of these have expressed a desire to seek asylum. It is not known how many of these proceed to the EU. But not everyone wants to go to the EU. The Guardian visited an asylum camp miles outside Belgrade in Bogovađa village, where Iranians were living. Amin, a gay Iranian, fled from the Iranian city of Shiraz after his father reported him to the police for having sex in the house with his partner. His friends bought him a one-way ticket from Tehran to Belgrade. “When I arrived, they kept me in the airport for six days – I had no money, no hotel reservation and no return ticket,” says Amin. “I came here with nothing. In Iran, my biggest threat was my own family, not the government. Family is the biggest problem when it comes to LGBT.” Like Amin, many refugees are detained immediately at the airport – have been deported since last year. The Guardian spoke to a group of Iranians held in a detention centre at Belgrade Nikola Tesla airport who said they were beaten up, humiliated and kept in horrible conditions for more than a week. They sent pictures of themselves with bruised arms and legs, and a toilet overflowing with faeces. The Serbian interior ministry denies that the guards used force against them and said one refugee fractured his hand after falling down. Back in the Miksalište refugee centre in Belgrade, Samsour, a Afghan, ate bread and cheese given to him by his cousins. He has not been able to shower for six days, nor has he a blanket for the cold nights. The outside walls of the refugee centre have recently been transformed by an Iranian artist called Reza. One wall features a cartoonish depiction of a journey from Africa, and a cake behind the wire fences of the EU surrounded by yellow stars. An eagle is breaking into the fence, reaching a blue area, reminiscent of the colour of the EU flag.

44,"Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that Israel had identified a “secret atomic warehouse” in Tehran, containing nuclear equipment and radioactive material. Israel prime minister called for new sanctions against Iran and accused European leaders of “appeasement” for opposing them. In a speech to the UN general assembly on Thursday, Netanyahu said he was revealing the existence of the “atomic warehouse” for the first time in public. As he has in past presentations , Netanyahu brought visual aids to illustrate his claims. He held up a satellite image which he said showed where the warehouse was located in Tehran, and a photograph of a nondescript wall and metal gate, which he said showed of the exterior of warehouse. Netanyahu described the facility as a “secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran secret nuclear weapons programme”, but gave no further details, other than to allege that government officials had spread of the radioactive material around the streets of Tehran in an attempt to dispose of it. He said a nearby rug cleaning business should check its wares for radioactivity. Tehran is party to a agreement curbing its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. As part of the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) it dismantled uranium-enriching centrifuges and a reactor and exported most of its stockpile of enriched uranium. It is not clear, even if some surplus equipment was stored in a Tehran warehouse, whether it would represent a violation of the JCPOA. Dismantled centrifuges were to be stored in specified locations under international monitoring, but there not specific stipulations on the storing of other ancillary pieces of hardware. Since the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly certified that Iran is abiding by the terms of the JCPOA. But Netanyahu urged the IAEA director general, Yukiya Amano, to investigate the warehouse Israeli intelligence had identified. “Do the right thing. Go and inspect this atomic warehouse immediately,” Netanyahu said. Donald Trump broke ranks with his European allies in May by withdrawing the US from the agreement and calling for the sanctions to be reimposed on Iran. An effort by Trump to win support for his Iran policy on Wednesday however left him isolated as other council members voiced their support for the JCPOA as long as Iran continued to abide by the agreement. Netanyahu lauded Trump and condemned European states, accusing them of appeasing Iran, and making clear he was deliberately drawing parallels with the Nazi era and the initial failure of the UK and France to stand up to Hitler Germany. “I just used a strong word: appeasement,” Netanyahu said. “I use it reluctantly but unfortunately that is exactly what we are seeing again in Europe.” “I’m a historian son,” the Israeli prime minister went on. “I have to ask: have whether these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?” Netanyahu theatrics&nbsp;help push Trump towards Iran deal withdrawal In a similarly dramatic presentation in April , Netanyahu unveiled what Israel claimed was a nuclear archive that the country intelligence services claim they had seized and smuggled out of Tehran. Documents purported to have been part of the archive appear to have previously been seen by the IAEA, as early as and made public by the agency in Asked about the possible significance of the “atomic warehouse” Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department responsible for implementing the IAEA, said: “I’m sceptical just because this would be a strange and ineffective way to release this information. But if the Iranians are found to be in violation, it would be a different story.” “For the Iranian government … Netanyahu speech is merely pageantry,” said Holly Dagres, nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council and editor of the council IranSource blog. “Unfortunately for Netanyahu, his annual general assembly speech fell flat in the United States, his primary audience after Israel , since the speech took place during the Kavanaugh hearing. Tehran will likely see this as somewhat of a blessing.”",668,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/netanyahu-claims-israel-has-found-irans-secret-atomic-warehouse
45,"Ministers are pressing to toughen the government stance towards Iran by proscribing the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah in Britain. Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based political party and militia, and since the UK has banned only Hezbollah military wing or apparatus, not its political arm. The call to ban the group has been a longstanding demand of the British Jewish community, and many Tory MPs are eager to use an outright ban to contrast the Conservative approach to antisemitism with that of the Labour party. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt , has been pushing for tougher action, but reports of an announcement by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, at the Tory conference were not confirmed. Hunt is also eager to find ways to put pressure on Iran in the wake of its refusal to release the Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe . He has accused Iran of using her as a diplomatic pawn. Critics of Hezbollah, including the Labour MP Joan Ryan, the chair of Labour Friends of Israel, claim there is not any true distinction between the military and political wings, arguing they both promote antisemitic propaganda, the export of terror and the extinction of Israel. According to Home Office assessments, Hezbollah is committed to armed resistance to the state of Israel. Hezbollah blames Sunni militants for commander death A total ban would help Javid to argue he is closing down so-called safe spaces for terrorism. Until recently the government has argued that the political wing is not proscribed because ministers, acting on security service advice, have to strike a balance and maintain contact with the Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is a member. The security minister Ben Wallace has said the police have sufficient powers to prosecute cases of racial hatred. In a statement soon after becoming foreign secretary, Hunt described Hezbollah as an “outrageous, disgusting” organisation and said he deplored the group in its entirety. The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, has argued that proscription of the political wing would not conflict with the UK duty as a government to speak to ministers in the Lebanese government. Hezbollah, which is mainly Shia supported and Iranian financed, is already considered a terror group by the US, Canada, Israel and the Arab League. The European Union banned the political wing of Hezbollah in after an attack by members of the organisation on an Israeli tour bus in Bulgaria in which resulted in the deaths of five Israelis and their Bulgarian Muslim bus driver. During a lengthy meeting at the UN general assembly in New York on Thursday, Hunt pressed his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, to intervene in the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held in jail for two years. Hunt came away believing Zarif understood the UK position. He said: “The central issue here is that the Iranian government is detaining innocent people as a tool of diplomatic leverage, and we cannot operate on that basis. Zarif understood the British position, but what happens inside the Iranian regime frankly is more complex. We are not going to let this situation rest, or ignore the problem. “I want Iran to publicly recognise that this is a situation that they need to address and that this is not a stable situation. What they are doing is holding innocent people to create diplomatic leverage.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",594,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/hezbollah-could-be-banned-in-uk-in-bid-to-toughen-iran-stance

47,"Theresa May has used a pair of speeches at the UN summit in New York to firmly contradict Donald Trump isolationist view of the world, arguing that the best way to resist extremist forces was through close cooperation between countries. The prime minister, speaking a day after Trump address to the UN general assembly explicitly rejected global cooperation in favour of a “doctrine of patriotism”, even delivered a polite if direct rebuke to the US president over his abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal . May, who was addressing a special session of the UN security council on weapons proliferation chaired by Trump, told the president that the deal remained “the best means of preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon”. Trump urges world to reject globalism in UN speech that draws mocking laughter The prime minister, in her main address to the general assembly shortly afterwards, reiterated her call for transnational cooperation, saying public disillusionment about economic and political systems risked a return to influence for far left and far right ideologies. “We have to show there is a better way to meet the concerns of our people,” she said. “That way lies in global cooperation between strong and accountable states based on open economies and inclusive societies.” While Downing Street was adamant that May choice of words was not intended to be critical of Trump, whom she was meeting one-to-one in a final engagement before leaving New York on Wednesday evening, the strong language would be seen by many as a counterpoint to Trump stark statement to the UN: “We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.” She did also say countries should address the worries of “those who feel that the global economy is not working for them”, citing reform of the World Trade Organization as one area where action was needed. In her security council speech May also warned of potential renewed military action if chemical weapons were again used in Syria . Russia and other backers of Syria government should seek to avoid repeated use of chemical weapons, she said, adding: “For there must be no doubt: we will respond swiftly and appropriately if they are.” May also condemned what she said was Russia “desperate fabrication” in response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack. On Iran, May said the long-negotiated international deal on the country nuclear programme, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), had been “an important step forward” in addressing worries about Tehran nuclear ambitions. She said: “It remains the best means of preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and we are committed to preserving the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to abide by its obligations in full.” Trump announced in May he was breaking with European allies over the Iran deal, and signed an executive order reimposing sanctions on any foreign company that continued to do business with Iran. May has repeatedly and publicly disagreed with Trump over his decision. She praised Trump for his talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un , saying this had “created a historic opportunity for complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation” on the Korean peninsula. But here, too, she played up the role of international cooperation, saying previous sanctions imposed by the UN “played no small part” in getting Kim to the negotiating table. May, in her condemnation of Russia over the novichok attack in Salisbury, said: “We have taken appropriate action, with our allies, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our collective security. Russia has only sought to obfuscate through desperate fabrication.” More widely, May praised the multilateral treaties on weapons proliferation as “one of the greatest achievements of the international community, demonstrating the value of global cooperation”. She said: “It has improved all of our security. It has brought a measure of predictability and stability. And it has paved the way to arms control agreements and disarmament.” May ended by again reminding Trump about the benefits of cross-national work: “Mr President, it was collective engagement by states across the globe that produced the counter-proliferation framework. “Even the most powerful recognised that investing in collective rules-based restraint was the only effective way of addressing national security interests and avoiding unilateral recourse to force.” Despite her criticism of Trump strategy, the prime minister later held talks with him in New York, where they discussed the issue of a US-UK trade deal following Brexit. Trump is risking more than a war of words with Iran | Simon Tisdall “They agreed that Brexit provides a wonderful opportunity to strike a big and ambitious UK-US free trade agreement,” a No statement said. They also discussed Syria , and taking action against what Downing Street called “Iran destabilising regional activity”. The White House statement on the talks cited discussions on various international situations, but made no mention of a trade deal. May, asked by reporters ahead of the talks how the British people could believe Trump would stick to his word over trade, given his habit of sometimes changing his mind about international agreements and his tendency to routinely say things that are untrue , argued he had shown trustworthiness. She cited examples including the US decision to expel Russian diplomats in the wake of the novichok nerve agent attack on Salisbury. This meant he could be trusted on a trade deal, May said, arguing the omens were positive: “It in both our interests to do that good trade deal, and I believe that when we have negotiated that deal it will indeed be put in place.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",970,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/may-chides-trump-over-decision-to-abandon-iran-nuclear-deal
48,"Efforts to fight the continuing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo were set to resume on Wednesday after a suspension following a attack by militia in which people were killed. At least people have died so far from the recent outbreak of the disease, and people are known to have been infected. The decision to resume the effort to vaccinate thousands of people in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri will go some way to reassure worried health officials. Ebola: medics brace for new cases as DRC outbreak spreads The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday that the outbreak could worsen rapidly because of the attacks by armed groups, as well as because of community resistance and the broad geographic spread of the disease. The outbreak has occurred in one of the most violent parts of DRC, a base for dozens of armed groups that contest government authority and exploit mineral resources in the region. The militia attack on Saturday took pace on the outskirts of the city of Beni. In a second incident, in the town of Oïcha, about miles north of Beni, armed men burned houses, killed one man and kidnapped children and one woman on Monday night, according to two local officials. Both attacks have been blamed on a group known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which has a history of targeting civilians and is considered one of the most active and violent of the armed groups operating in the region. The insecurity in the region and a mobile population has made vaccination campaigns – like the one that helped overcome an Ebola outbreak that killed people in the DRC north-west this year – less effective. Insecurity is likely to intensify as tensions rise with the approach of elections later this year, observers said. “We are now extremely concerned that several factors may be coming together over the next weeks and months to create a potential perfect storm,” Peter Salama, the World Health Organisation emergencies chief, told a news conference in Geneva. Although the weekly number of new cases has fallen from about to about in the past few weeks, and more than people have been vaccinated, significant obstacles remained, Salama said. Nyonyi Masumbuko Bwanakawa, the mayor of Beni, said vaccination of people had resumed. “All stakeholders including civil society leaders have agreed to resume the work on Wednesday because suspending it can be dangerous to those infected ... everybody understands the severity of the epidemic.” Congo enters uncharted territory as it faces gravest Ebola challenge to date The Congolese army has launched new operations against the ADF to try to ensure the campaign against Ebola can continue safely. A military spokesman said the militia attacked on Saturday at about and clashed with the army for nearly six hours. The militia long-term aim appeared to be to establish a base close to Beni. After the attack Beni declared a “ville morte”, a period of mourning, until at least Friday. On Monday of Ebola contacts (people at risk of developing the disease and so requiring monitoring) and three suspected cases in and around Beni, could not be reached for disease monitoring, officials said. The town of Oïcha, which is almost entirely surrounded by territory held by the ADF, has two confirmed cases of the virus and one probable case. Pockets of “reluctance, refusal and resistance” to accept vaccination were generating many of the new cases, Salama said. Some people were fleeing into the forest to escape Ebola follow-up treatment and checks, sometimes moving hundreds of miles. Uganda , to the east, is now facing an imminent threat, and social media posts were conflating Ebola with criticism of the DRC government and the UN and a range of conspiracy theories, a development that could put health workers at risk. The DRC, whose heavily forested interior makes it a natural home for Ebola, is at the forefront of a global campaign to combat the disease.

49,"Emmanuel Macron will offer honours and a financial support package to the families of Algerians who aided French troops in the war of independence, as part of a wider policy of confronting his country colonial legacy in north Africa . Earlier this month, the French president took the historic step of acknowledging for the first time that France carried out systematic torture during the conflict. Macron – the first French president born after the Algerian conflict – has turned his attention to the Algerians known as “harkis”, a loaded and often pejorative term for the Algerian Muslims who helped the French in the brutal eight-year independence war and faced discrimination and poverty in France . 'My father was tortured and murdered in Algeria. At last France has admitted it' Macron is granting national honours to more than former fighters and those who have campaigned for recognition for the harkis as well as a support package designed largely to help their descendants, who still face marginalisation and poverty. After a peace accord granted Algerian independence in March about Algerian loyalists were allowed into France. There, they were often kept in camps behind barbed wire and suffered discrimination, marginalisation and poverty that has lasted across generations. Tens of thousands more were left behind in Algeria and faced reprisals. The fate of the harkis in France and their descendants, who number hundreds of thousands, remains a highly sensitive issue in Paris, acting as a reminder of its colonial history. In recent years, films and novels have tackled the issue of discrimination against harkis. In a bestselling novel last year, The Art of Losing , the writer Alice Zeniter tackled the assumptions in France around the term “harkis” and highlighted the haphazard and uncertain ways a person might pick a side in a conflict as brutal as Algeria independence war. Some harkis had previously fought for France in the second world war. Macron acknowledged that the French military instituted a “system” that facilitated torture as it sought to cling on to its rule in the country. He said the past must be faced with “courage and lucidity”. The French government is to present its package of financial support over four years for descendants of harkis. But concerns persist over whether the support will be sufficient and whether France should go further and offer a full official apology. The Algerian conflict, which has been shrouded in secrecy and denials, is still seen as unresolved in the French collective psyche. Macron is said to view it as a divisive factor that must be addressed. Macron caused controversy during the presidential campaign last year by declaring that France colonisation of Algeria was a “crime against humanity”. He later backtracked on his comments, calling for “neither denial nor repentance” over France colonial history, adding: “We cannot remain trapped in the past.”",473,/world/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/25/macron-faces-up-to-france-algeria-colonial-past-with-40m-euros-harkis-aid
0,"Theresa May has refused to rule out further compromises in order to broker a final deal with the EU, but hit back at Boris Johnson after the former foreign secretary questioned her belief in Brexit. The prime minister was asked repeatedly whether she was prepared to make further concessions to the EU after European leaders rejected her proposal in Salzburg earlier this month, saying it would risk the integrity of the EU single market. Speaking on the first day of the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, May told the BBC Andrew Marr Show that the government had to wait to hear the EU specific counter-proposals. “We need to know what their concerns are,” she said. “This is challenging for the EU and I accept that. It is a deal like no other, they have not done it with anyone else. We believe it does not destroy the single market and we need to have that conversation with them.” Overnight, May pre-conference announcements were overshadowed by comments by Johnson in an interview with the Sunday Times , in which he cast doubt on the prime minister commitment to leaving the EU compared with his own beliefs. “Unlike the prime minister I campaigned for Brexit ,” he said. “Unlike the prime minister I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in On Sunday, May said she was the one ensuring Brexit could be delivered. “I do believe in Brexit, but crucially I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on behalf of the British people, while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of it,” she said. The prime minister also admitted her party could not rule out a hard border in Northern Ireland in the event of no deal, but said there was not an alternative proposal on the table apart from her Chequers plan for a free trade area for goods, governed by a common UK-EU rulebook. “If we get to the point of no deal … we as a United Kingdom government are still committed to doing everything we can to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” she said. “But there is only one plan on the table at the moment that provides for that frictionless trade across the border and indeed between the UK other borders with the EU.” Johnson, the most keenly watched challenger to the prime minister, has called for May to ditch her plan and broker a deal similar to the one the EU has with Canada, but which would require customs checks on the Northern Irish border, which he says could be simplified with technology. He said May proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other tariffs was “entirely preposterous” and called the entire plan “deranged”. May said it was wrong for critics of her Brexit plan to portray the alternative as a “free trade deal” and said the other alternative proposed was not a Canada-style deal, which took seven years to negotiate, but a very basic free trade agreement. “People often differentiate Chequers from a free trade deal, but at the heart of Chequers is a free trade deal,” she said. “If you have a free trade agreement, you have to agree the rules you’re going to trade on. Canada for the UK is not on the table from the EU. What is on the table is a basic free trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and single market.” The former Brexit secretary David Davis, who departed the cabinet over the Chequers plan a day before Johnson, said he would vote against the prime minister plan as it stood. “It will be a very, very exciting autumn in Westminster because the government, if it sticks with Chequers, will lose the vote,” he told Sky News. “Losing votes is always difficult for governments, but governments have lost votes in the past.” He also cautioned his former cabinet colleague Johnson and said he would back May in any vote of no confidence. “Where I differ from Boris is that he is conflating the two,” he said. “This is such an important issue we must keep it away from internal Tory party battles and from leadership issues.” The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, also made a thinly veiled dig at Johnson in her interview on Sunday morning, especially his admission that he did not fully appreciate the implications of the withdrawal agreement, where leaders agreed to implement a “backstop” to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market to avoid a hard border, should no deal be reached. “I don’t sit around the cabinet table, I’m not in government. I do attend political cabinet. But I knew what was being said in December, I’m not quite sure how the foreign secretary didn’t,” she said. “He hasn’t even mentioned the fact that he was foreign secretary for two years and was in the room helping to influence this and, indeed, was praising it as soon ago as December.” The Labour chair, Ian Lavery, said the interview showed May was “tinkering around the edges” rather than rebuilding Britain. “The Tories are clearly too busy fighting among themselves and have neither the ideas nor the desire to offer real solutions to the problems they have caused,” he said.

1,"Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has warned the EU that the UK will turn belligerent in the Brexit negotiations if Brussels maintains it uncompromising stance. In remarks directly addressed to EU leaders, he said: “If you put a country like Britain in a corner, we don’t crumble. We fight.” The remarks in a wide-ranging speech that also included a well-received passage celebrating British exceptionalism. He said: The real reason for our success goes beyond ... anything tangible. It because of a few simple ideas that started here, on this small island, and went on to conquer every corner of the planet. One of those simple British ideas was free trade, a stroke of genius that was written into life by Adam Smith in Glasgow and exported across the seas by the Royal Navy. Another British idea was the fragile and beautiful insight that power should pass from leader to leader not by force, but peacefully through a franchise expressing the will of the people. The long journey to parliamentary democracy that started with Magna Carta. The speech was seen as boosting Hunt standing as a possible future leader. Speakers at the Conservative conference have strongly attacked EU leaders for the manner in which they dismissed Theresa May Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit earlier this month. Liam Fox , the international trade secretary, said: I’m sure that I wasn’t the only one after Salzburg, to feel that taunting Theresa May , one of the most unfailingly polite people I know, was absolutely beyond the pale. And Digby Jones , the former CBI boss, told the conference: I thought they showed themselves for what they are, bully boys, by their behaviour to our prime minister in Salzburg. I thought it was disgusting. Jones comment was widely applauded (even thought there was nothing new about what EU leaders said about Chequers at Salzburg; it was just the tone that was more negative than No anticipated). Jones was addressing the conference as a Birmingham dignitary, not as a party member, but he sounded as if he might have been a Tory as he praised Brexit lavishly. EU leaders have probably been advised to ignore anything said at this conference, on the grounds that it is just party politics and Tory activists are being indulged, but remarks like Hunt, Fox and Jones probably don’t make eventual compromise any easier. Fox has said that a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn would be a “colossal threat” to the next generation and warned Conservatives failed to spell this out at the last election. In his speech he said: Let me tell you what global investors really fear. They fear a Corbyn Labour government that would steal their investments and call it nationalisation They fear the dark forces bubbling under the surface of the hard-left - anti-wealth, anti-trade and antisemitic. A party which is not the future of the young but the betrayers of the young, whose reckless spending plans would leave an economic wasteland and a generation or more of debt to be repaid. Frankly, we failed to spell that out at the last election. We must now call out Corbyn hard-left Labour party for what they actually are, a colossal threat to the next generation and to the security and wellbeing of our country itself. Brexiter Tory MPs have renewed their calls for Theresa May to abandon her Chequers plan. At a Leave Means Leave rally, Peter Bone said: I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers. And Andrea Jenkyn s said: I am simply saying: prime minister, listen to the people. Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition not going to vote for it, it unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place. Please drop Chequers and start listening. Digby Jones has dismissed Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, as an “irrelevant and offensive person” because of Johnson apparent hostility towards business. (See Jones said this in a speech that was very well received by the hall. But Johnson is not the only Brexiter to criticise corporate opinion. In his speech Jones himself criticised the Financial Times newspaper for being too pro-Brussels, and the former Brexit minister Steve Baker described the CBI as “a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK” in a newspaper article. (See Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, has said the Ministry of Defence is set to recruit a teenage “cyber cadet” force which to help guard the nation against online attacks. (See The Conservatives could “go out of business as a political party” unless they re-engage with the needs of younger and minority ethnic voters, some of its own MPs have warned at the start of a party conference set to wrestle with the problem. That all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at BST Updated at BST Here is some Twitter comment on the Jeremy Hunt speech. From ITV Robert Peston From the Economist Jeremy Cliffe From the Spectator James Forsyth From the New Statesman Patrick Maguire Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit , is speaking at a BrexitCentral fringe this evening. It is probably the most popular meeting of the day. Here are some tweets. This is from the BBC Laura Kuenssberg. This is from ITV Daniel Hewitt. Gove says a no deal Brexit is something I would contemplate with glad Rajeev Syal Michael Gove has claimed that the UK will not lower its environmental or wildlife standards after Brexit but expressed concerns about the possibility that no deal will be struck with the EU. The environment secretary told a fringe event at Conservative party conference that it was an advantage for Britain to be known for quality food products and that the government would announce a food strategy later this year. Asked by World Wildlife Fund CEO Tanya Steele if he worried about ‘no deal”, Gove said: Well I do worry about it. I think that a deal would be much, much better. I think if we left without a deal, we and the EU would put in place all sorts of arrangements to make sure that the impact was mitigated. But it certainly not my favourite option. We’ve been talking about some of the things that we would need to do both constitutionally and in other respects in order to make sure that the ambitions that we have for the environment are met. I don’t think intrinsically a no deal Brexit with the right policies is harmful to the environment. I think we can do the right thing with our own legislation and the international commitments that we make, but it would certainly be the case that it would be disruptive initially and that would be a difficult period. We in government are seeking to be prepared for every eventuality, but it certainly not something I would contemplate with a glad heart. Here is an interesting take from the Sun Tom Newton Dunn on Theresa May interview earlier. Hunt says UK will if EU refuses to compromise in Brexit talks And here are two more lines from Jeremy Hunt speech about Brexit . Hunt said the UK would “fight” if the EU did not compromise in the Brexit talks. He said: And let me say one more thing about these talks. Never mistake British politeness for British weakness. Because if you put a country like Britain in a corner, we don’t crumble. We fight. Hunt did not explain what he meant by “fight” - although obviously he was not talking about deploying the new HMS Birmingham. (See (Hunt has used the line about not mistaking politeness for weakness before, although arguably the misunderstanding is his, not the EU. The UK has compromised more than the EU in the Brexit negotiations so far; Hunt words imply that that is because of politeness, but it more realistic to attribute it to the weakness of the government position.) He said the EU was failing to respond to the causes of Brexit. Punishing Britain for Brexit is dealing with the symptoms of the problem and not the cause, which is the failure of political elites across Europe - including people like me in Britain - to deal with people concerns about migration. That is the heart of the problem - and if you’re worried about the EU future that is also the solution. of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Conservatives Conservative conference Conservative conference Theresa May Boris Johnson",1437,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/30/tory-conference-brexit-theresa-may-marr-boris-johnson-labels-mays-chequers-plan-as-deranged-as-tory-conference-opens-politics-live
2,"In a libertarian, religious thinktank, the American Principles Project, convened a symposium on monetary policy in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Robert Mercer, the US billionaire behind Cambridge Analytica, was reported to have paid for the event. The Conservative MP for Wycombe, Steve Baker was a star speaker, who declared the trip in his register of interests . He would later become a Brexit minister – and is now the key figure coordinating the guerrilla war being waged by hardline Tories against Theresa May Chequers plan. Back then, Baker was causing trouble for the world most senior bankers, who were meeting in a separate conference in the mountain resort. Baker, took to the stage and declared that the panjandrums up the road posed an existential threat to capitalism itself. “Central banks are the problem,” he said. In a speech , he warned the world was in the grip of experiments in credit expansion and state management of economic growth, both of them “monetary socialism” and doomed to failure. He wanted the global financial system to evolve to a free banking model, whereby the value of money would be determined by market forces alone, free from any intervention by the state or central banks. Unfashionable ideas, boldly expressed, are something of a stock in trade for Baker, whose manoeuvrings may yet bring down the prime minister, or bring the UK closer to the no-deal Brexit that only the most ideological Eurosceptics would welcome. But ideology is something that drives Baker. And one of his heroes was a man who split the Tory party – and left it in the wilderness and unable to form a government for a generation. His speeches, interviews and own writings before and after he became an MP in illustrate the extent to which his political life has been shaped by radical libertarian ideals. Born in and state-educated in Cornwall, Baker took a degree in aerospace systems engineering as an RAF cadet and served as an engineer officer in the Royal Air Force until (“to fight totalitarian communism”, he told Politico ). He then took a master degree in computer science and became a software engineer, initially working for small companies. It was two years’ work as a software architect for the financial services firm Lehman Brothers from to that would alter the trajectory of Baker life. “One of the things I realised as a software engineer, asking the detailed questions,” Baker would later explain, “is that they didn’t really understand how the system worked, or what the implications of it were.” Following the financial crash, he co-founded his own thinktank, the Cobden Centre , named after the English radical Richard Cobden, who led the campaign to abolish the Corn Laws, overturning trade restrictions on grain but splitting the Tory party in the process. He also began volunteering for the Centre for Social Justice, a rightwing thinktank founded by Iain Duncan Smith, and in was elected to parliament. At a meeting of the Libertarian Alliance the same year, he said: “I think the European Union needs to be wholly torn down.” Though it was Euroscepticism that he said inspired him to seek political office, the subject of his maiden speech was, true to form, monetary policy. It is a theme he has repeatedly revisited throughout his early parliamentary career, championing the laissez-faire Austrian school of economics, and predicting a future with a free banking system, driven as much by new technologies as base metals. He has placed his money where his mouth is, and recently reported a shareholding of over in Glint Pay Ltd, an app for bartering in gold, on his parliamentary register of members’ interests. Baker has other political interests – he visited Kashmir in (Wycombe has a large number of Kashmiri constituents). Outside parliament, he has an extraordinary array of hobbies; he has posted thousands of photographs on Flickr, rides motorcycles, enjoys sailing, and skydives. A born-again Christian, Baker has said his faith is very important to him but has written of his acceptance that it is impossible to “eradicate abortion and related actions completely”. Unfashionable and outside the political mainstream, he would likely have remained in the obscurity of the Tory backbenchers had events not quickly, and inexorably, turned his way. Following the general election, he co-founded Conservatives for Britain, a group of Tory MPs described by the Guardian as “ the new bastards ”, intent on putting pressure on David Cameron as he renegotiated the UK membership in the EU. After Cameron announced the EU referendum, it was Baker who successfully headed off the possibility of it being posed as a “yes/no” question (“yes” typically enjoys an advantage) and secured a “remain/leave” question format, according to the political journalist Tim Shipman book Fall Out. In late he became chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) – at a time when it had almost no public profile. Baker was the man who instilled military discipline, organising a disparate group of MPs through a WhatsApp group, coordinating their media appearances and firing off public letters agitating for the government to take Britain out of the single market and customs union. Behind the scenes, Baker ERG was also raising money. Most of it came from the taxpayer – MPs can claim a year via their expenses. But private donations were funnelled into a second bank account, the existence of which was only discovered after a freedom of information request. This revealed how parliament expenses watchdog had repeatedly written to the group to convey the concerns of MPs and members of the public that taxpayer funds were being misused for political campaigning. The largest private donation of came from a pro-Brexit businessman. But more intriguing was a donation in December from the Constitutional Research Council. The CRC is an “unincorporated association”, which paid supposedly the largest donation in Northern Irish history, to the Democratic Unionist party for its own pro-Brexit campaign. The identities of the CRC backers have never been revealed. In early following Cameron announcement of the EU referendum, Baker, by now a leading figure in the leave campaign, emailed pro-Brexit colleagues with an idea. He suggested creating multiple legal entities that could each spend campaigning to leave the EU. “Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” Baker wrote . The plan was swiftly disavowed after critics warned it would be illegal. Baker was appointed Brexit minister in but quit over May Chequers proposals, and has since closely associated himself with a push by an assortment of rightwing thinktanks to force a harder break from the EU. In recent months, he has been ever-present at events designed to undermine his prime minister. He spoke at the ERG launch of a report by Economists for Free Trade on the purported merits of a “world trade deal” (meaning no deal with the EU and trading on WTO terms). He also attended the launch by the Institute of Economic Affairs of its “Plan A+” proposal for the UK to “deliver the Brexit prize” through radical free trade deals and deep cuts to regulation with countries including the US. Earlier this year, undercover journalists from the environmental NGO Greenpeace filmed the IEA director, Mark Littlewood, describing how the organisation was in “ the Brexit influencing game ” and explaining that he had facilitated meetings between the author of the Plan A+ report, Shanker Singham, and Baker. Politicians in Westminster and Brussels may be growing increasingly alarmed at both the prospect and the potential ramifications of a collapse in the Brexit negotiations. For Baker, the priority remains to avert what he regards as an altogether more apocalyptic scenario: the collapse of capitalism itself. His public statements are occasionally laden with a sense of doom, as well as a sense of mission that has pushed his party to the point of self-destruction. He has written that “in truth, it is often hard to be optimistic when you have ‘taken the red pill’ of Austrian School economics”. In he told Politico that western economies were “ on a catastrophic trajectory ” and destined to face the same fate as debt-ridden Greece.

3,"Quote of the day Jeremy Hunt on the Brexit talks in a speech to the Tory conference arguably as much about his own leadership ambitions as his brief as foreign secretary: “And let me say one more thing about these talks: never mistake British politeness for British weakness. Because if you put a country like Britain in a corner, we don’t crumble. We fight. Row of the day Boris Johnson versus everyone else. The former foreign secretary might have hoped his pre-conference interview with the Sunday Times would dominate the first day. Instead he first found himself sharing the front page with Theresa May , and then had his ideas – including a grand plan for a bridge to Northern Ireland – either mocked or derided. Tory conference: Hunt says UK will 'fight' if EU refuses to compromise in Brexit talks - Politics live Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said Johnson had spent “very little time” in his criticisms of May Brexit plans mentioning the fact he was foreign secretary for two years “and was in the room helping to influence this and, indeed, was praising it as soon ago as December”. Even his former cabinet colleague David Davis criticised the ideas he raised in the interview: “He wants to cancel and spend it on a bridge to Northern Ireland. I don’t want to do that. I think one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas that cost a fortune and don’t do much good.” More blunt still was the former CBI head Digby Jones who told the conference that reportedly derogatory comments by Johnson about business “showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is”. I do believe in Brexit, May says – but won’t rule out compromises Debate of the day Unlike Labour, the main Conservative party conference hall doesn’t hear debates: it receives speeches from ministers, which are received with different degrees of rapturous reverence. Of those on Sunday, the address by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson , was notable in that in contained some new announcements. This included improved welfare support for armed forces members, including career development plans and ID cards to allow veterans to show they have been in the forces when they are back in civilian life. He also announced a scheme for so-called “cyber cadets”, to learn how to protect the country from cyber-attacks. Tweet of the day The home secretary, Sajid Javid , joins the throng mocking Johnson “Irish bridge” brainwave, tweeting: Monday highlight Philip Hammond speech at noon. The chancellor speech is usually the second biggest highlight of Tory conference, after the prime minister. But there a crowded field this year, with grassroots favourites Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg touring the fringes.

4,"The Conservatives could “go out of business as a political party” unless they re-engage with the needs of younger and minority ethnic voters, some of its MPs have warned at the start of the party conference in Birmingham. In the opening speech in the main conference hall, Brandon Lewis,the party chairman, told delegates that the UK was changing quickly, with the Conservatives at risk of being left behind. In a long section devoted to party modernisation, Lewis cited the Tories’ record in areas such as equal marriage and reforming police use of stop-and-search tactics. This was “a proud record”, he said, adding: “But if we are honest, it hasn’t done enough to change the perception some people have of our party today.” Tory conference: Hunt says UK will 'fight' if EU refuses to compromise in Brexit talks - Politics live Earlier, an event on the conference fringe discussing how the Conservatives can gain more younger voters heard from a series of backbenchers, all of whom urged swift action. Neil O’Brien, who became MP for Harborough last year, noted that in the election there was a massive deficit between the Tories and Labour in terms of younger voters, and those from minority ethnic backgrounds. At the election, O’Brien said, the Tories lagged two percentage points behind Labour for voters in their , and by four percentage points for those aged Just two years later these deficits had shot up to and points behind . The party was also doing increasingly less well among other groups whose numbers were rising, such as those with degrees, people who were unmarried, and those who rented their homes or live in cities, said O’Brien, a former director of the Policy Exchange thinktank. Major security flaw in Tory conference app reveals users' data “All these different social bases of Conservatism are being eroded,” he said. “Either we have to do much better amongst these groups of people, or we’re going to go out of business as a political party.” Such structural changes would have an impact, he added: “It a bit like a beam that is rotting away, and eventually it snaps.” Another leading reformer, George Freeman, MP for Mid Norfolk who formerly chaired Theresa May policy unit, said the differences in how people of various ages voted was key for the party future. He said: “It isn’t just about, can we get more new people in the Conservative party, it is the dividing line in politics. And I think we’re on the wrong side of it. It not too late to get on the right side of it, but it won’t just happen.” While in just of female voters under voted Labour, by this had risen to Freeman said: “We have a real problem, a massive problem. We have a demographic, structural and economic crisis in our political support base, and it getting worse, just with the passing of time.” The Observer view on the Conservative party conference | Observer editorial Solutions for the party raised at the event included radical changes to the housing market, a cut in interest rates for student debt, and an attempt to become less tribal over Brexit. The way Brexit was being debated in the party risked putting young people off the Tories for good, Freeman said. “That religious zealotry, I think, is completely weird to a generation under and I fear will lead us to Jeremy Corbyn having the keys to post-Brexit Britain.” At yet another event the former education secretary Justine Greening urged a new focus on social mobility, calling it “an existential challenge for our party”. It was, she noted at a fringe speech, years since the party last won a significant Commons majority, under Margaret Thatcher in “It is years since we last truly carried the political argument in this country,” she said. “It means we stopped connecting with people a long time ago.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",689,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/30/tories-conservatives-could-go-out-of-business-without-engaging-young-voters-says-their-own-mp-neil-obrien
5,"Brexit is already costing the public purse a week, new research has found – a stark contrast to the “dividend” promised by the Leave campaign. The Centre for European Reform analysis also suggests that the government austerity drive would be on the way to completion had Britain voted to stay in the European Union. Johnson labels May Chequers plan 'deranged' as Conservative conference opens - Politics live It shows that the UK economy is already smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum. Public finances have been dented by a year, more than half of the defence budget. This translates to a penalty of a week, a figure that is growing. The stark finding comes as the Tory conference begins in Birmingham, with Theresa May premiership under severe strain. The prime minister faces competing proposals from cabinet ministers over how she should resolve the Brexit impasse with the EU. The febrile conference coincides with explosive claims that the boss of one UK-based carmaker has been flown by private jet to meet President Emmanuel Macron, in an attempt to persuade the company to move manufacturing to France after Brexit. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, told the Observer this development was a sign of the damage Britain faces from the wrong deal. While some ministers are pushing for a loose, Canada-style trade deal, support is growing in May ministerial team for a deal under which Britain would stay closely tied to the EU for a limited period. May is being warned that for some businesses a Canada-style deal is little better than crashing out of the EU with no agreement in place. Fairbairn said that companies were already acting to minimise the impact of trade friction at Britain borders. “Among car manufacturers , we have heard of one CEO who has been flown out on private jets to meet Macron about relocating his entire business,” she said. “You have got tens of millions being spent by firms on preparing for friction at borders. “One of the reasons that the government proposals are on the right track is that they will mean no friction at borders. This is what the Canada deal does not do. It does not do it in some really fundamental ways. For some of our members, it is not much better than a no-deal outcome.” A YouGov poll of entrepreneurs and chief executives, carried out by the People Vote for another referendum, suggests the Tories risk denting their pro-business reputation over the handling of the Brexit talks. Almost three-quarters believe Britain is heading for a bad deal. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, said it suggested the party was “jeopardising its reputation for economic competence with the business community as a result of the way Brexit has unfolded”. Meanwhile, Britain wealthiest funder of independent scientific research, the Wellcome Trust, says it is losing patience with the government. Writing in the Observer , the trust director states that in common with industry and universities, his organisation – which spends more than a year on medical research – is increasingly nervous. “No deal would leave a void on access to funding, regulation and, critically, migration,” Jeremy Farrar states. “Wellcome … wants to support researchers, wherever they are from, in order to tackle the greatest global health challenges. But if the conditions and the culture here are damaged that will affect our support. It is not unconditional.” The CER thinktank model on the costs of Brexit examined its impact up until the end of June. It said the findings were a central estimate that contained a margin of error. Researchers created a model of how the economy would have fared had Remain won in June An earlier estimate in the summer suggested that Britain economy was smaller than it would have been by the end of the first quarter of As it has developed its model and updated it for the second quarter of the gap has grown. The model also suggests that had Britain not voted to leave, the deficit would be down to just of GDP, or It would mean the austerity drive in place since would be all but complete.",699,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/29/britain-bill-brexit-hits-500-million-pounds-a-week
6,"The Conservative party chairman responsible for overseeing conference has refused to confirm whether or not he would be resigning from his role after a major security flaw in the conference app exposed the private data of cabinet ministers. Anger was directed towards Brandon Lewis in the immediate aftermath of the security breach as senior party figures poured scorn on the chairman credentials. One senior Tory said: “Brandon Lewis is telling everyone who will listen that he could be the man to run the country – yet this conference fiasco shows he couldn’t run a bath.” In an interview on Sunday morning, Lewis recognised the seriousness of the incident and said his focus was ensuring conference went smoothly. “Any breach of data is a serious matter and that why we are taking it seriously,” Lewis told Sky News. “We are investigating, and we have already contacted the information commissioner, and will be putting in a fuller report to them. “We’ve spoken to the company that supplied it, who themselves have put out a statement apologising for the error that they made.” Neither Lewis nor the app provider was able to reveal the extent of the mishap and the MP for Great Yarmouth speculated that “it will be a limited number of our delegates”. “This will affect people where somebody has guessed or already known somebody email address and was therefore able to log in as them,” he said. “So, it will be a limited number of our delegates here and we are contacting the delegates to outline to them what has happened and what they can do about that.” Asked whether he considered resigning over the “fiasco”, Lewis said: “At the moment I’m focused on making sure that conference goes well.” The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson , said the episode was embarrassing for the party. “I think there was an issue there but it was resolved very quickly,” she told Sky News. “Of course the party is going through all the appropriate inspections and remedies that are there. “It is embarrassing, there no getting away from that, but it was identified early, it was fixed quickly and then we move on.” In order to attend Conservative party conference, hundreds of people were required to consent for their personal data to be shared with a third party, CrowdComms Ltd, which developed the Conservative Party Conference event app that many guests appeared to have no option but to agree to “utilise”. The registration form for attending the conference stated: “Your data will only be shared for this purpose and will not be given to any other third party.” The app has a list of speakers; however, many of those listed – including journalists, dignitaries and businesspeople – do not appear to be speaking at the conference. This list remained visible on Sunday, although the app is now functioning securely. The data of attendees could be accessed by guessing email addresses, with that of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Gavin Williamson and others among those whose personal information – including their phone numbers – was potentially viewable. Cabinet ministers were reported to have received prank calls, while others, including Johnson, appeared to have their details changed. Twitter users claimed the former foreign secretary picture had been briefly changed to one featuring a pornographic image. Attendees received an email from the party on Sunday, which said it was taking the incident “very seriously”. “It not good enough that people data may have been made available and we are disappointed that we have been let down by a third party supplier,” the email read. In a statement, CrowdComms said: “An error meant that a third party in possession of a conference attendee email address was able, without further authentication, to potentially see data which the attendee had not wished to share – name, email address, phone number, job title and photo. “We apologise unreservedly to the Conservative party and their delegates.” The Information Commissioner Office said it would be making inquiries with the Conservative party – which had already made an initial data breach report to the public body – and that organisations had a legal duty to keep personal data safe and secure.

7,"Foreign buyers of properties in the UK will have to pay a new levy, in a renewed attempt by Theresa May to tackle the housing crisis. With concern growing among senior Tories that the party has allowed Brexit to drown out a compelling domestic agenda, plans unveiled on Saturday night will see foreign buyers pay extra stamp duty to fund a drive to tackle rough sleeping. The announcement marks the start of the party conference in Birmingham, where the prime minister is desperate to avoid another row over her Brexit plans that might threaten to engulf her premiership. Ministers are also concerned that the party has been failing to respond to the radicalism of some of Labour economic programme , set out at its own conference in Liverpool last week. On Sunday the prime minister will attempt to return to her vow to tackle social injustices and champion what she describes as the “British dream” – the idea that the next generation should do better than the last. Fixing the housing market is a major part of the programme. It comes as the latest Opinium poll for the Observer suggest the Conservatives take a three-point lead into their conference. Despite being carried out during the Labour conference week, which can often provide a poll bounce, the poll puts the Tories on support, with Labour on According to Opinium, Labour had entered its conference with a two-point lead. The Tory plans unveiled on Sunday follow concerns that foreign buyers have been taking advantage of Britain housing market as a safe haven for their money, pushing up prices in the process. Party aides pointed to research from York University which estimated that of new London homes were bought by non-residents between and A study by King College London estimated a one percentage point increase in the volume of homes being sold to overseas companies put up house prices by The exact increase in stamp duty, which will be paid by individuals and companies not paying tax in the UK, will be hammered out after a consultation. Those buying a second home or buy-to-let property already pay an extra chunk of stamp duty on purchasing their property. The extra money raised will be used to support schemes in the government rough sleeping strategy . The plan has echoes of the new Labour policy, revealed in last week Observer , to increase council tax on second homes used as holiday homes. Labour said the funds raised would be used to tackle homelessness – and especially to help children in temporary accommodation. May said: “At Conservative conference last year, I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream, that life should be better for each new generation, and that means fixing our broken housing market. Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here. “However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don’t live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hardworking British residents. “For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real. This government is committed to helping hardworking British residents get the right home for them and helping to end the scourge of rough sleeping for good.” The latest Opinium poll suggests that Labour lost support among Remainers after its conference – the party was three points down among the group, with support falling from to of those who voted to stay in the EU. Some Tories believe their party relatively healthy polling figures suggest the public were impressed with May recent Downing Street statement, in which she demanded more respect from the EU in its negotiations with Britain. However, there is little change in how voters regard May leadership qualities. The poll does contain some good news for Labour. After its conference, it is regarded as a more united party. Last week of the public perceived Labour to be generally united, which has risen to The proportion who perceive Labour to be divided has dropped from to Jeremy Corbyn approval rating has improved marginally, with a net approval – the difference between those who think he is doing a good or bad job – of minus compared with minus last week. May approval rating has also improved from minus to minus May lead over Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister has remained stable at points. In terms of May future as prime minister, of the public think she should resign, which has dropped from in December last year. Tory voters appear to be split between Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in terms of who they want as the next party leader. Opinium polled adults online between September and September. As well as concerns over its domestic agenda, there are also fears in the Tory party that its pro-business reputation is being put at risk by those pushing for a hard Brexit. A poll released by the People Vote campaign suggests that, while most business decision-makers regard the Tories as pro-business, their confidence falls when asked about the way in which the government has pursued the Brexit talks. Only of those surveyed said the party is pursuing business-friendly Brexit policies, while disagreed. Business leaders from companies that do no trade with the EU would split between staying in the EU and leaving, if they were given a public vote. However, among those from companies whose trade with the EU is more than of turnover, the split is in favour of staying in. Melvin Benn, managing director of Festival Republic, which promotes Latitude, Reading and Leeds festivals, and the Download festival, said: “A hard or no-deal Brexit would not only create worrying commercial difficulties for my industry, but would cripple the economy and potentially strand our artists at passport control when they should be striding on to the main stage.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",1035,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/29/theresa-may-slaps-new-property-tax-on-foreign-buyers
8,"A prominent Conservative critic of Boris Johnson has said she would support a new Brexit referendum because “irresponsible” rightwingers in her party had killed off the Chequers plan . The Cambridgeshire South MP, Heidi Allen, said she would now back a second public vote on leaving the EU because of the threat to jobs and businesses in her constituency and the rest of the country from crashing out without a deal. It came as the Conservative party gathers in Birmingham before the start of its annual conference on Sunday, with Johnson at the centre of a huge row over criticism of Theresa May negotiations with Brussels. Allen told BBC Radio Today programme she would still support in principle an hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister, but many in the party, especially on the right, would not. Describing them as “fiscally and economically irresponsible”, she said: “They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands. Forget Salzburg. The real Brexit battleground will be Westminster | Anand Menon “It is they who have made Chequers dead and that being the case – they have made their position totally clear – then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative other than asking, should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.” Allen comments came as the former prime minister John Major made the case for another vote and described attacks made by some Tory MPs over May leadership as “completely unacceptable”. Speaking at an event in South Shields alongside the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, Major said: “I do not think routine attacks on the PM in the most lurid fashion is either the spirit of politics that one would wish to see, or is it in the interest of the negotiating posture of the United Kingdom. “The threats that come in her direction of a leadership election unless she delivers a certain sort of Brexit … [went] far beyond anything that I would think was remotely acceptable in behaviour towards any prime minister.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",410,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/29/tory-mp-says-she-would-back-new-brexit-vote
9,"In the middle of last year election campaign, Matt Hancock sister had a very nasty accident that left her struggling for life in intensive care. Later, when she had recovered, she went to see her GP to get the all-clear to have her driving licence restored. The doctor asked why she had lost her licence in the first place. “The GP had no idea that she’d been through this experience,” said Hancock. “The system simply hadn’t thought to tell the GP.” This was a horrifying revelation about how bad the NHS has been at getting its digital life in order – its left hand often has no idea what its right hand has been doing. One of the self-described “missions” of the new health secretary is sorting this out. “I’ll go round the world looking for the best technology that can save lives and improve the lives of clinicians too. We need to be embracing it.” This is a big challenge that has defeated many predecessors. He acknowledges that the health service history with IT projects is punctuated by “huge and costly mistakes”, including multibillion-pound programmes which were ultimately scrapped at enormous cost to the taxpayer. Why will this time be any different? One reason, he says, is because he knows “a top-down solution” will not work. “I’ve learnt that what you need to do is have standards that are agreed nationally and then allow people locally to work out what they need. I don’t want to buy an IT system for the whole NHS, but when somebody does buy an IT system within the NHS, I want to make sure that it fits with everybody else.” His admiration for private sector health tech – he has enthused about Babylon controversial online consultation app – leaves many wary. After everything we have been learning about the abuse of data by tech titans – and all the attacks on their platforms that he himself made when he was minister responsible for digital – does he really think they can be trusted with healthcare? “It has to be based on consent. So your data about your health is your property. That is my starting point. That must be the principle that I will put at the foundation of data protection in the NHS.” We suggest that his vision of a technologically transformed NHS will not be much relief to a patient stuck on a trolley waiting for treatment in A&amp;E at three in the morning. After a prolonged financial squeeze, the health service is struggling to cope with rising demand and rising expectations from a growing and ageing population. He does not dispute that key performance indicators, such as waiting times, are heading south, though he prefers to call it “pressure”. His predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, won an extra for the NHS over the next five years and Hancock has to make some big decisions about how to spend the money. He identifies three priorities. One will be technology. Another will be prevention. A third concern is the workforce, which he thinks is too often the victim of what he calls “old-school” management. By way of examples, he cites “rates of bullying (which) are far too high”. He also concerned about sexual harassment within the NHS, and “there too much racism. There isn’t much, but any is too much for me. I’ve seen this in the staff surveys.” He is the first MP to have launched an app devoted to himself – and been widely mocked for doing so. One Twitter wag claims to have met his girlfriend on the Hancock app “but we tell people that we met at a bar”. Colleagues suspicious of his ambition see it as another example of relentless self-promotion. It increasingly clear that unrestricted use of social media by younger children is very damaging Matthew Hancock, health secretary At the same time as being a tech evangelist, he is also a fierce critic of the industry behemoths and remains very exercised about the effect of social media on the mental health of children. “It increasingly clear that unrestricted use of social media by younger children is very damaging.” He reveals that he has asked the chief medical officer to produce guidelines, similar to those issued on safe drinking, about the use of social media by children. “The reason we need formal government guidance from the chief medical officer is to empower parents. As a parent, you want to be able to say: ‘The rules say that you shouldn’t use social media for more than a certain period of time.’” Hancock has three children. What rules does he impose at home? “My children aren’t allowed on social media,” he says. A zero-hours rule? Doesn’t his call him a fascist who is preventing her from talking to her friends? “She accepts it,” he says, but “the pressure is growing … This isn’t easy for individual parents to do on their own.” That why we needed to create “a norm in society”. His rise up the greasy pole of government under Theresa May has surprised some. He was a protege of George Osborne and nearly all the rest of them were purged when she became prime minister and sacked the then chancellor and culled most of his gang. In return for her unexpected favour, Hancock is studiously loyal to his leader. He is one of the diminishing band of cabinet ministers still willing to defend her Chequers plan for Brexit, saying “there is no deal on the table” that is better. Like many Tories he fears that his party, mired in what he calls “the fog of the Brexit debate”, is losing critical arguments with Labour. Labour conference was “scary” and its prospectus “could really sink Britain”. He goes on: “It is mission critical for us to win the argument for a well-run market economy. It more important than ever to make the argument for support of aspiration and wealth creation.” When we ask whether May will lead the Conservatives into the next election – most Tories assume not – he answers “yeah” without missing a beat. He is more stuck for an answer when we invite him to come up with one adjective to describe the prime minister. You can almost hear the frantic clicking of his brain synapses before he produces “fastidious”. Fastidious? Is that much of a compliment to his leader? “I was going to say fortitude, but that not an adjective is it?” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",1117,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/29/health-secretary-matthew-hancock-nhs-technology
10,"Theresa May must remake the case for conservatism to take on Labour and prove that her party cares about “left behind” parts of the country, her de facto deputy prime minister has said. David Lidington, who oversees both the domestic agenda and the Brexit process, said the Conservative party had not yet done enough to reach voters who felt their local areas had been neglected by the government. The Cabinet Office minister said May should go back to “first principles” as he suggested she would serve a full parliamentary term despite her leadership coming under sustained attack from within the party. He indicated May was prepared to make more concessions on her Brexit plans in order to get a deal, in spite of fierce opposition from Brexiter MPs and the Tory grassroots. “Yes I do think we’re going to get through to he said in an interview. “I think people underestimate the degree to which most Conservative MPs, and certainly most Conservative members in the country, want to get behind the government and the PM and get things done. “When you get to the next election, of course the public will have a memory of how [Brexit] was handled, but actually they, in my experience at elections, tend to ask: ‘What are you going to do next for me?’ What we offer on domestic policy is very important.” He added: “These are things that she [May] cares deeply about. We are all in government having to spend a lot of time and energy on EU exit stuff at the moment … But I think she will also want to focus on and get results in some of these key areas of domestic policy.” Earlier in the week Lidington raised speculation that May knew her leadership days were numbered when, asked whether she should take the Tories into the next election, he said she would “decide in due course what she wants to do”. He told the Guardian: “If I were to say no, which I’m certainly not going to say, that then becomes dagger-wielding. If I say yes, that turned into a great plot of some kind. So as long as she got the energy to continue, she’ll have my support to do it.” His intervention follows what was widely regarded as Jeremy Corbyn most successful Labour conference yet. Prominent Tory ministers and backbench MPs have been left fearful that Labour policies have exposed a lack of substance in their party beyond infighting over Brexit. As May heads this weekend to what many predict will be her final party conference as leader, Lidington stressed the importance of making the Tory case for government. “I think we can never do enough, let me put it that way. There always more that can be done and it was clear at the last election, as the results showed, that we were not getting that message across with sufficient persuasive power, and we were not reaching those people whose votes were perhaps affected by those issues,” he said. “As a party, I think we have to make again, from first principles and telling stories to illustrate it, the reasons why we believe that a free-enterprise economy is the best way to deliver both high living standards in the face of global competition and digital technology, and at the same time enable individual men and women to have greater freedom for themselves and their family. That they are better doing that at company level, at the individual, family level, than if this is done here in Whitehall.” He warned the Tories against relying on outdated tactics to attack Labour. “What is true is that some of the arguments that we’ve used about Labour in the past won’t work now,” he said. “With every year that passes there less and less point in referring to the You can’t just republish an Adam Smith Institute pamphlet from and think that going to do it. “You’ve got to take people through the argument from basics. You’ve got to take account of the reality of [the] gig economy, of the fact that young people will expect to change not just jobs but careers several times in their lifetimes.” Lidington, a former Europe minister under David Cameron, is part of May inner circle on Brexit, one of just a handful of ministers trusted to meet Brussels chiefs and oversee Brexit plans on her behalf. He remains confident of getting a deal, although government insiders have suggested this could ultimately be dependent on Brussels compromising on its proposals for a backstop for the Irish border. He said conversations had “intensified” since the disastrous Salzburg summit, where EU leaders rejected key planks of May Chequers plan. This week the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said Chequers was only the “basis for agreement”, raising the prospect of further concessions from May despite deep resistance from Tory Brexiters. “The prime minister has said repeatedly that nobody is going to get all that they want, there going to have to be give and take on both sides – there always is in a negotiation,” Lidington said. However, he was clear that the UK would not break its word by under-cutting the EU on social, environmental and employment standards, which some Brexiters and libertarian MPs believe could boost the economy post-Brexit. “It not just about the standards of production, it about the environment in which that production takes place and whether you unfairly undercut the costs, becoming a sort of Shanghai on the Thames or Shenzhen on the Thames. But that is not where the prime minister is. The Chequers package represented a strategic choice for continued close alignment with the European model.” Lidington claimed that getting the final deal through the House of Commons was not something that kept him up at night, suggesting that once a final deal was agreed it would focus the minds of MPs on all sides. He hinted that the political declaration on the future trading relationship with the EU that accompanies a withdrawal agreement could be deliberately vague, even though No is understood to have concerns about getting it past MPs. “You can’t have, you won’t be able to have, a document this year which is able to answer every detailed question,” he said. “But it got to have enough clarity so that parliamentarians both here and in Strasbourg know where it is we’re heading. It got to be something better than saying this is going to be the biggest, most beautiful agreement that anybody has ever reached. It got to be more than slogans.” Lidington said there was no getting away from the fact that an abrupt Brexit would involve “considerable economic dislocation”, which in the long term could affect investment in some of the “left behind” parts of the country, many of them leave-voting. Many of May MPs feel she has not done enough to offer solutions to those areas, but Lidington said: “We don’t think that can be done by passing an act of parliament or waving a magic wand. It is more complicated. I don’t think it being honest to people if you’re saying this can be done overnight, click the fingers. We’re talking about very deep-rooted problems here.” But he conceded: “It not enough to say that average prosperity has increased. Actually, you can’t be comfortable with a state of affairs in which there are whole communities and sectors of society that feel left out.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",1280,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/29/david-lidington-may-must-remake-case-for-conservatism-brexit
11,"Deep divisions over Brexit overshadowed the opening day of the Conservative party conference on Sunday as Theresa May attempted to wrestle back the focus on to her domestic agenda. The bitter infighting that has crippled the Conservative party was laid bare as big beasts including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg laid into the prime minister Brexit plans as thousands of delegates gathered in Birmingham. May appealed to Tory MPs and the party grassroots to back her Chequers proposal as she was forced to hit back at Johnson, her former foreign secretary, who questioned her belief in leaving the European Union. “I do believe in Brexit, but crucially I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on behalf of the British people, while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of it,” she told the BBC Andrew Marr. However, May risked infuriating the party pro-Brexit grassroots by appearing to refuse to rule out further compromises to her Chequers plan in order to broker a final deal. The Tories are a party in crisis, their identity in desperate shape | Matthew d’Ancona It came after Johnson used a newspaper interview to launch a renewed attack on May entire Brexit plan, dismissing it as “deranged” while suggesting the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other tariffs was “entirely preposterous”. Rees-Mogg, leader of the hard Brexiter European Research Group, said the plan was the “deadest of dying ducks” at a packed fringe meeting with hundreds of delegates while Tory MP Conor Burns, a former aide to Johnson, also pleaded with the prime minister to change course. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who is often considered a leadership contender, struck a more combative tone in his speech to the party faithful, seeking to burnish his credentials with an attack on Brussels’ negotiating tactics . He said the EU seemed to want to “punish” a member for leaving, and likened their tactics to the Soviet Union. “The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish it will grow … and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to escape,” he said. While Hunt remained loyal to May Brexit position, he went on to attack the EU for embarrassing May at the last summit at Salzburg with the unexpected rejection of Chequers. “Because if you put a country like Britain in a corner, we don’t crumble. We fight. So as your friends of many years we say simply this: Brexit is not about whether you succeed or we succeed. Europe prospers when we both succeed and it time to change your approach.” Responding to a tweet highlighting Hunt comparison of the EU to the Soviet Union, Latvia ambassador to the UK Baiba Braze said: “Soviets killed, deported, exiled and imprisoned thousands of Latvia inhabitants after the illegal occupation in and ruined lives of three generations, while the EU has brought prosperity, equality, growth, respect.” However, several senior Tories criticised Johnson over his intervention. Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: “Now, I don’t sit around the cabinet table, I’m not in government ... but I knew what was being said in December. I’m not quite sure how the former foreign secretary didn’t.” The Tories are desperate to show that they have more to offer the public than just infighting and will on Monday attempt to shore up their domestic agenda with a series of announcements, including plans to expand apprenticeships and detailing an eye-catching ban on employers pocketing workers’ tips. 'May totally betrayed us': Tory grassroots' Brexit tension boils over Business secretary Greg Clark said on Sunday that the government determination to protect business underpinned May Chequers plan for post-Brexit trade. “We are a country that is superbly well positioned in most of the big transformations that are taking place across the world today,” Clark told a HuffPo fringe meeting. “To do that, we need to be able to build on the foundations that are successful – from manufacturing to pharmaceuticals and life sciences. And the ability to trade without introducing new barriers and frictions is important to that.” Clark dismissed the “ super-Canada” plan being pushed by Johnson and his fellow hardline Brexiters . He said: “One of the problems of the Canada model is that it requires frictions at the border, it requires checks at the border – – I think everyone recognises that, and it doesn’t do what is necessary to avoid those frictions which would set back our competitiveness.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",804,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/30/may-fights-to-assert-authority-at-tory-conference-as-brexit-divisions-erupt
12,"We have long had serious concerns about the lack of due impartiality and accuracy in the reporting of allegations of antisemitism against Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party. The recent report by the Media Reform Coalition examining coverage of Labour revised code of conduct on antisemitism shows that we are right to be concerned. The research examined over articles and broadcast news segments and found over examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. In relation to the IHRA definition of antisemitism that was at the heart of the dispute, the research found evidence of “ overwhelming source imbalance ” in which critics of Labour code of conduct dominated coverage, with nearly of Guardian reports, for example, failing to include any quotes from those defending the code or critiquing the IHRA definition. Moreover, key contextual facts about the IHRA definition – for example that it has only been formally adopted by eight countries (and only six of the IHRA member states) – were consistently excluded. The researchers conclude these were not occasional lapses in judgment but “systematic reporting failures” that served to weaken the Labour leadership and to bolster its opponents within and outside of the party. It is of course entirely appropriate and necessary for our major news outlets to report on the horrors of antisemitism, but wrong to present it as an issue specific to the Labour party. In covering the allegations that Labour is now “ institutionally antisemitic ”, there have been inaccuracies, clear distortions and revealing omissions across our most popular media platforms. We believe that significant parts of the UK media have failed their audiences by producing flawed reports that have contributed to an undeserved witch-hunt against the Labour leader and misdirected public attention away from antisemitism elsewhere, including on the far right, which is ascendant in much of Europe.

13,"few dozen people with an average age of gathered in a room to discuss how to win back the under Though not Matt Hancock , who was a no-show. A shame because he could have lowered the average age to The health secretary is going on James Brokenshire also failed to attend a fringe event on dealing with disasters and emergencies. Not even the communities minister had an answer to the disaster that this year Tory party conference in Birmingham is shaping up to be. The best that anyone is hoping for this year is to come out alive. Even those who did turn up were rather regretting their decision. The business secretary, Greg Clark, had the best of it as no one heard a word he had to say because he was drowned out by whoops and cheers from next door for Ruth Davidson , the woman whom every Tory – Boris Johnson excepted – wishes was their leader. In a studio nearby, the prime minister – for the time being at any rate – was going through the latest in her ongoing series of private hells on the BBC Andrew Marr show . Normally the Sunday morning of a party conference is a chance for a party leader to come up with some positive spin and a policy announcement on the politics chat shows. Theresa May only had her silence to offer. Nothing to say on Windrush . Nothing to say on Brexit. Nothing to say about anything. She merely rolled herself into a foetal ball, her expression a hybrid of fury and glacial misery, and counted down the minutes to the end of the interview. It was left to Brandon Lewis to open proceedings in the main conference hall. After scraping the barrel with his achievements in holding on to Wandsworth in the local elections, Lewis declared: “Never did I believe I might stand up here as party chairman.” It was a feeling widely shared by everyone in the room, as he is a man who likes to keep his talents well hidden. It also a racing certainty that he won’t be party chairman by this time next year, as he was responsible for showing the government was leading the way in technological Brexit solutions by producing a conference app that listed the phone numbers of almost everyone in government . Fortunately, Chris Grayling had managed to provide the organisers with the wrong details, so he wasn’t compromised. Even the losers get lucky sometimes. Tory conference: Hunt says UK will 'fight' if EU refuses to compromise in Brexit talks - as it happened For some reason, Lewis chose not to mention Appgate – probably hoping that there were plenty more far worse shitstorms yet to come and everyone would have forgotten about his by the end of the week – and instead concentrated on delivering a speech so dull, so devoid of content insight, that it would set the tone for the whole conference. An endeavour in which he was wholly successful. So much so that there were even fewer people in the hall than there otherwise might have been to hear Liam Fox declare that the big Brexit dividend was to be found in selling dairy products to China. Blessed are the cheese-makers, for they shall inherit the earth. Even by his own standards, that was catatonically dim, but these days the international trade secretary will say almost anything to get some attention. His neediness is not attractive. Tories could ‘go out of business’ without young voters, says MP Normally the speech from the defence secretary is one of the highlights of a Tory conference, but Gavin Williamson reputation precedes him. The more desperate he is to sound authoritative, the more he sounds like Private Pike. He is a man who oozes levitas, even when he has two awfully big announcements to make. The first was that he was going to name a new ship HMS Birmingham. The second was that he was going to set up a cadets’ cyber security training centre. This from a party that can’t even manage its own conference app. Even Private Pike had the grace to die a little at this point. The only speaker to stop the audience from flatlining wasn’t a politician. Or even a Tory. But Digby Jones, the former head of the CBI, is a fully paid-up Brexiter and he was there to tell everyone that Brexit was going to be fine. He didn’t know why and he didn’t know how, but no one was too concerned. They just wanted a glimmer of hope.

14,"Will Tanner, the former adviser to Theresa May and director of the Onward thinktank It can’t be worse than last year. That is the bottom line for Theresa May , no matter how Boris Johnson behaves. In truth, with luck and a good strategy, this could be the week she regains control of the narrative and turns the grudging respect of the party into fondness. Last year the prime minister was apologising for leading her party into minority government. This year she is six points ahead in the polls and leading the country out of the European Union. Her plan for Brexit remains the only substantive one on the table, and her declaration that “we stand ready” after Salzburg means no one can doubt her resolve. Brexit is not this week main event and the prime minister should direct her energies elsewhere. If she sets out a serious vision for Britain economy and society after we leave the EU, she will prove wrong the people who think the Tories are running out of road. She will need to be bold – pledging to jumpstart a comatose economy, fix broken markets, cut immigration and strengthen fragmented communities. However, with fewer than days before Brexit, it is the right moment for leadership. Isabel Hardman, the assistant editor of the Spectator Theresa May is a cautious type but this conference season will go much better for her if she breaks at least one political rule. It is often said that if she were to say publicly that she is not going to “go on and on”, this would undermine her authority. But the reality is that her party doesn’t want her to go on and on, and is quite publicly discussing who will take over. May would gain far more from saying honestly that her time as leader is limited, but that she wants to use it to protect her party from the siren calls of populism on both right and left. She could then join the debate about what sort of party the Conservatives want to be, rather than appearing delusional about her own chances. One of her strongest moments was, oddly, straight after the election, when she told MPs: “I’m the person who got us into this mess and I’m the one who will get us out of it.” She should deploy that same realism this week. Kate Andrews, an associate director at the Institute of Economic Affairs The top priority for any party, but especially the one in charge, is to put the UK in the best position it can be to claim the Brexit prize. Now that the Chequers plan has essentially been rejected, it time to move on to a framework that should have been pursued from the beginning – a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU. But Brexit cannot be the only topic on the agenda. Once the UK has exited, it will become even more apparent which domestic policy woes the UK government alone is responsible for. Housing remains the issue of the day. Too many people – especially those on low incomes and the young – are struggling to get on to the housing ladder. The answer is clear: liberalise the housing market and build more homes. Stewart Jackson, a former MP and chief of staff to the ex-Brexit secretary David Davis Team May objective is to get through conference with some modicum of authority and credibility, not mislay any members of her cabinet who despair at her Brexit strategy, and trash the team Boris insurgency. Chequers landed very badly, not just with members and the usually loyal local officials, but MPs – both Leave and Remain. The open secret over the past years is that Theresa May isn’t very good. The Chequers fait accompli is like Monty Python Black Knight – mortally wounded but not yet dead. While Salzburg bought a little time with supporters and the electorate, the fundamentals haven’t changed. Her only way through is to: rebadge Chequers, map out a Canada-plus deal, de-dramatise her fixation with the Ireland border by offering a different backstop, and articulating a positive picture of post-Brexit.

15,"MPs could still alter any Brexit deal secured by Theresa May and voted through by a majority in parliament, researchers have concluded. Analysis of parliamentary procedures on both sides of the Channel show that MPs could wave Brexit through but still force concessions during the process of putting it on the statute books. They could also make amendments to the withdrawal bill, which could amount to a rejection of the deal. Forget Salzburg. The real Brexit battleground will be Westminster | Anand Menon It is widely expected that if May gets a deal she will leave as little time as possible for MPs to scrutinise it, calling a vote in the House of Commons within days of returning from Brussels. However, the researchers said this could prove problematic. “If MPs feel they have been press-ganged into voting on a deal that they have not had sufficient time to absorb, this could create problems down the line,” said the authors of The Brexit Endgame, published on Saturday to mark the start of the six-month countdown to the departure deadline. The Guardian view on May and Brexit: honesty is still an option | Editorial The report – written by researchers from the UK in a Changing Europe organisation, which conducts academic research on Brexit, and the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law – shows that even if the prime minister secures a deal, she is not home and dry. The authors, Matt Bevington, Alan Wager and Jack Simson Caird, spell out the hurdles she must jump, testing every permutation of parliamentary procedure. If May strikes a deal with Brussels, she will come back with two settlements: a fully agreed draft withdrawal bill, which must then be made into law; and a political deal, which will set the framework for the future relationship and trade negotiations between the UK and the EU. The authors point out that if politicians vote through the deal, they will still have the option to make amendments to the withdrawal agreement when it is translated into a bill. Anything substantial would amount to a rejection, which is is unlikely, but they could win concessions at this point. “MPs will have longer to scrutinise [the bill] than the withdrawal agreement so it is therefore conceivable that they will raise issues at this point that they did not have time to bring up or had not considered when the exit deals were passed,” they say. Can Theresa May keep her Brexit bus on the road? MPs could make their support conditional on a vote on the final trade deal, or on a second referendum. “As we’ve seen with previous bits of Brexit-related legislation, the threat of a defeat might lead the government to amend its proposals,” the report says. If the government rejected any proposed amendments, it could offer inducements instead, such as a “meaningful vote” on the trade treaty. The political agreement that May hopes to secure in Brussels is not legally binding so a meaningful vote on the future trade deal could be valuable to her opponents. Alternatively, the government could choose not to resubmit the deal for parliamentary approval and simply end the negotiations and opt for a no-deal scenario. Under its own rules, the government must make a statement by January on what it intends to do. If there is no agreement, the authors believe this would be the point when a vote of no confidence could occur under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. This does not automatically trigger a general election but would make one more likely. The authors’ analysis of the unprecedented European procedures also highlights the potential for changes in the unlikely event that the European parliament rejected the deal. If it did, EU negotiators would have to seek changes to the withdrawal agreement to satisfy the European parliament. If negotiations on either side took a little longer than timetabled and the article process was extended slightly, the pressure to sign off would still be immense, the authors predict. The European parliament last voting session is on April. If a deal is not ratified by then, Brexit could not be voted on again until parliament returned in the autumn and a much longer extension of article would have to be considered. This would require unanimous support at the European council of prime ministers.

16,"The general rule in Brussels is that what goes on at a party conference stays at the party conference. Rhetorical fireworks from politicians playing to the crowd are regarded as part and parcel of the political cycle, to be safely disregarded as a bit of theatre. But with six months to go until Brexit , the normal rules do not apply. Every cough and spit in the British debate at this stage is attracting the closest attention, and much of it is causing great anxiety in the EU quarter of the Belgian capital. Jeremy Corbyn was first up, with his leader speech in Liverpool. To say it was forensically examined and discussed by EU officials and diplomats does not do it justice. EU officials liked bits of it. They chortled in the European commission at Corbyn line that the government envisioned a “Britannia that both rules the waves and waives the rules”. They thoroughly approve of Labour policy on negotiating a customs union with the EU, and have had this message passed on to the Labour leader. But the central thrust of Corbyn speech worried them deeply. Corbyn has made it clear he is sticking with his “six tests” as the criteria for judging whether Labour will back the government in the meaningful vote on a deal in parliament. The six tests – not least the one insisting that a deal must offer “the exact same benefits” of single market and customs union membership – are designed to help Labour vote down whatever May brings home. Certainly Labour members are clear that they would vote down a free trade agreement of a so-called Canada+++ nature (the pluses are increasing in ratio to the desperation in Brussels for it to be accepted). It might cover lots of sectors, from fisheries to aviation, and avoid tariffs, but it would leave Northern Ireland in the EU customs territory and do little to protect Britain manufacturing base from checks, red tape and worse. The former home secretary Amber Rudd has said Tory MPs would join Labour in the “no” lobby. The EU executive senses danger, and it has started disregarding some diplomatic norms to try to mitigate against it. On Thursday Corbyn was in Brussels for the inauguration of Place Jo Cox in honour of the Labour MP murdered a few days before the EU referendum. On hearing that Corbyn would be in town and likely to visit Michel Barnier, the commission all-powerful secretary-general, Martin Selmayr, known as the “monster of Berlaymont” for his tactical nous and work ethic, let it be known he would like to talk to the Labour leader. It was a potentially controversial move. EU heads of state and government – acting as something of a leaders’ union – have previously told Barnier, their chief Brexit negotiator, they felt distinctly uncomfortable about him meeting the leader of Theresa May opposition. Selmayr rendezvous would do little to ease concerns. When the Guardian broke news of the meeting , the commission spokesman told reporters there was no meeting of which he was aware. Weasel words that were swiftly shown to be so. The meeting took place. Selmayr laid on the charm, as he is very capable of doing. Selmayr, who is in charge of no-deal preparations and who will take control of the trade talks after Brexit day on March wanted to keep open the lines of communication and keep talking. But if Selmayr was the good cop, Barnier, in the next hour-long meeting, proved to be very much the hard-hitting bad cop, willing to crack some heads to get a result. Corbyn was told that his stance made a no-deal Brexit more likely than not, sources in Brussels claimed, although talking to reporters later the Labour leader insisted that no opinion on his party position was voiced. Barnier and his deputy, Sabine Weyand, told Corbyn they believed they might be close to finding agreement with May, but everyone needed to act calmly and responsibly if the withdrawal agreement was to get through parliament. Senior figures in the commission believe Labour could play a key role in de-dramatising the issue of the Irish border. It is likely to have been an unwelcome lecture that exposed just how worried the Eurocrats are, even before the Tories have started their caterwauling in Birmingham. Asked what they would most like to hear from the Conservative party conference getting under way this weekend, there are two responses from EU officials and diplomats involved in the talks. Initially, they express their frustration. They have no understanding of the political fissures and rivulets that run through the Conservative party, little understanding of the Downing Street strategy, and have almost completely given up on trying to work with May in a coordinated way to stage-manage a result. It just doesn’t seem possible. That might all sound rather gloomy. But it is the second reaction that should cause the greater concern. Some say they just hope the Conservatives can have a “sensible, rational discussion” in which they accept that keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs territory is the only solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, and come to realise that the EU is offering a trade deal like no other. The coming days and weeks are likely to prove a considerable disappointment.

17,"Q: Chequers is dead, isn’t it? No, says Theresa May . She defends the plan, saying the EU proposed two options - Norway and Canada - that were both unacceptable. Her plan delivers on the Brexit vote, restoring control of borders and laws, but ensures no hard border in Ireland. Q: So it is not dead, but resting. Are you willing to alter it? May says, if the EU have counter proposals, she wants to hear what they are? Q: Are you willing to move as well as to listen? Let see what they say, she says. She says what is important is to have frictionless trade. Theresa interview with Andrew Marr The Andrew Marr interview with Theresa May will start shortly. Updated at BST Boris policy ideas much says David Davis Ruth Davidson , the Scottish Conservative leader, and David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, were both interviewed on Sky Sophy Ridge on Sunday. And both of them criticised Boris Johnson for what he has been saying to the Sunday Times. (See Davidson said Johnson was attacking plans that he supported when he was in government. She said: What I think is strange about some of the attacks in the newspapers today is that this is someone who was praising what the prime minister brought home in terms of moving on to the next stage last December, someone who was in one of the great offices of state who was sitting around the Cabinet table, who now says he was in some ways deceived. She also pointed out that, in his interview, he seemed more keen to talk about his record as London mayor than his record as foreign secretary. She said: He seems to be spending an awful lot of time talking about his London mayorship and very little time, in fact he hasn’t even mentioned the fact that he was foreign secretary for two years and was in the room helping to influence this and, indeed, was praising it as soon ago as December. And David Davis said the policy idea Johnson floated in the interview were flawed. He said: Take what he said this morning in the papers. He wants to cancel and spend it on a bridge to Northern Ireland. I don’t want to do that. I think one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas that cost a fortune and don’t do much good. If you’re going to use that money, use it for broadband or something else ... Boris is a great mate of mine, we have a very knockabout friendship, but quite a lot of his ideas, I think, are good headlines but not necessarily good policies. The criticism from Davis is more significant, because Johnson and Davis were both leave voters (unlike Davidson) and Davis and Johnson both resigned around the same time over Chequers. But since then they have not been working together in trying to get Theresa May to think again. Updated at BST Boris Sunday Times interview - Summary One of the signs that Boris Johnson is running a quasi-covert bid for the Conservative party leadership is that he has started to propose alternative domestic policy. There is more of that in his Sunday Telegraph interview, which goes well beyond calling Chequers “deranged”. (See Here are some more lines from the interview. Johnson said the Conservatives should do more to defend the principles of free market economics. He said: I think we need to make the case for markets. I don’t think we should caper insincerely on socialist territory. You can’t beat Corbyn by becoming Corbyn. I believe that the best way to pay for great public services is to have a strong market economy, and I think that we should be proud of being Conservatives , proud of what we stand for, believe in ourselves and believe in our ability to create the wealth to pay for fantastic mental healthcare services, a fantastic social care, a fantastic NHS. He said should be shelved in favour of a trans-Pennine high-speed rail link. He said: There are projects we should have on transport in the north of the country that ought to take precedence over It crazy how long it takes to get east–west across the country. He cast doubt on Theresa May commitment to Brexit. He said: Well, unlike the prime minister, I campaigned for Brexit . Unlike the prime minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is alas not what people were promised in He claimed that, in continuing to press May to adopt his alternative to the Chequers Brexit plan, he was like a “loyal and faithful labrador”. I am like a loyal and faithful labrador that is relentlessly returning to her an object that she has mistakenly chucked away in the form of her own first instincts about how to do this. (Johnson capacity to use language to mask the truth never ceases to amaze. “Loyal and faithful”? You have to laugh ...) He claimed he wants Theresa May to stay on as prime minister for as long as she wants. He said: The prime minister said she is going to serve for as long as her party wants her, and I certainly think she should. He restated his call for a bridge to be built to Ireland. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, Johnson record with bridges is not a good one. J ohnson denied having met Steven Bannon, President Trump former adviser, this summer. He said: That is total cobblers. This whole thing about Steve Bannon is a load of the biggest . . . I have met him in the White House. He wanted me to be on his show and I said no, he wanted me to meet him and I couldn’t. It is total balls, total utter balls. He described himself as a “one-nation Tory”. I remain an absolutely solid one-nation Tory, I believe totally in the duty of our society to care for everybody in society as equals. I believe that we should be welcoming and generous towards people of talent who want to come to this country, and I always felt that. He mocked the Guardian for overstating his unpopularity. Ten years ago when I first ran to be mayor of London, The Guardian ran a whole section in which various prominent Guardianistas and others said they would leave the country — I think Max Hastings was one of them — if I became mayor of London. I think Max is still here, knocking around somewhere. They’ll always find something to take offence at. Johnson mocked Sir Alan Duncan, his deputy when he was foreign secretary, who criticised him in an interview with the Times (paywall) on Saturday. Duncan told the paper: [Johnson] an enormous character but not a team player, not intellectually focused. He got a very untidy mind. And he doesn’t know if he a journalist or a politician — but he does know it all about him ... The more he repeats what everyone can see is not credible the more his own credibility disappears. His supposed solution is neither workable nor on offer. If he thinks he can go into the conference and undermine [Mrs May] I think he kidding himself. I think the party will be for her and not for him. Asked about these comments, Johnson said: He should pick on someone his own size. It was a joke about Duncan height; he not tall. Updated at BST Dominic Grieve says of Tory MPs back second referendum on Brexit In an article for the Sunday Telegraph (paywall) Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general and one of the key pro-Europeans in the party (he led the revolt in the Commons demanding a “meaningful vote” last year) , claims that a “significant group” of Conservative MPs now favour a referendum on the final Brexit deal. He strongly backs the idea himself, saying it would be a “pragmatic” way of resolving the deadlock on this issue. Here is an extract: I believe the time has come for a polite rebellion by pragmatic Conservatives . Including myself, it is now clear that there is a significant group of Conservative MPs who think that a People Vote- a vote on the final form Brexit will take, is absolutely indispensable for the future wellbeing of our country .. A no deal Brexit is a proposal so damaging to our future that it cannot be accepted. Apart from around of my colleagues linked to the ERG, none I have come across believe that such an outcome could be acquiesced to with a clear conscience. So the only possible response must be to return to the British electorate and ask them what they want. That, it seems to me, is good pragmatic Conservative position. It presupposes nothing as to the outcome of a referendum. It responds to the clear evidence of a shift of public mood on the consequences of Brexit. It can and should be couched in honest terms which provide a choice that reflects the options now on offer and are capable of being implemented thereafter. Such a referendum cannot be categorised as undemocratic. We are after all the party which insisted in enacting legislation requiring the trade unions to ballot their members on the outcome of any pay negotiations because we considered it essential members should have the option to express a view before rejection or acceptance. This argument, about Brexit being like a pay negotiation, is one that has been used by union leaders like the GMB general secetary Tim Roache, although Grieve may be the first person to point out that the Tories have already legislated for votes on final deals. Grieve says a “significant group” of Tory MPs now back a second referendum. It is not clear from this whether he thinks the number of MPs involved is significant, or that it is just who they are that is significant. Until now only a handful of Conservative MPs have explicitly backed a second referendum. Updated at BST May announces plans for festival celebrating UK in In her Sunday Times interview Theresa May also announced plans for a festival to celebrate Brexit Britain, due to take place in January just months before the next scheduled general election. She told the paper: We want to showcase what makes our country great today. We want to capture that spirit for a new generation, celebrate our nation diversity and talent, and mark this moment of national renewal with a once-in-a-generation celebration. Describing what planned, the paper reports (pdf): The event, called the Festival, is designed to pump billions of pounds into the economy and has conscious echoes of Queen Victoria Great Exhibition in and the Festival of Britain in ... Ministers are to set aside to plan the event and hire a creative director. Neil MacGregor, the broadcaster and former director of the British Museum, and senior figures from the London Olympics are in the running to take charge. The festival will be one of a number of celebrations already due to take place that year — including the anniversary of the Edinburgh International and Fringe festivals, the birthday of the BBC and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. May proposes higher stamp duty for foreigners buying property in UK One of Theresa May goals as prime minister has been to show that she has a domestic reform agenda that goes beyond Brexit. By and large this has been an uphill struggle - most of the government energies are focused on Brexit, and media coverage reflects this - but the party will be using the conference to announce non-Brexit policy and in her Sunday Times interview May announced a plan to increase stamp duty for foreigners buying property in the UK. As Tim Shipman reports (pdf), This time [May] is focusing on a crackdown on foreign buyers of British properties. Those who do not pay tax in the UK will face a stamp duty surcharge of up to on top of the higher levels of stamp duty introduced in on second home and buy-to-let purchases. The money raised, expected to be tens of millions of pounds, will pay for a scheme to tackle rough sleeping. On Sky News a moment ago, Brandon Lewis , the Conservative chairman, said the government would consult on the level at which the stamp duty surcharge would be set. It would probably be around he said. Interestingly, at their conference Labour also announced plans for a new tax affecting second homes, with the revenues being used to help tackle homelessness. But Labour is proposing a new council tax levy, specifically aimed at holiday homes. And its policy seems predominantly aimed at British owners, not foreign owners. In an interview with BBC Breakfast this morning Brandon Lewis, the Tory chairman, refused to comment on Boris Johnson decision to describe an aspect of the Chequers plan as “deranged”. (See Asked if this language was appropriate, Lewis said: Boris has his own style of using language. I think the party is focused around being behind the prime minister to deliver a good deal for the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union. You would have to ask Boris what he thinks of the language he using. May says backing Chequers is in the national interest Theresa May has also given an interview to the Sunday Times (paywall) . In it, she argued that Tories should back her Chequers plan for Brexit because it was in the national interest. She said: My message to the Conservative party is going to be that people voted to leave the EU. I believe it a matter of trust in politicians that we deliver on that vote for people. We’re the party that always puts country first and puts the national interest first. And that what I want us to be doing. The only proposal on the table at the moment that delivers that is the Chequers plan. Boris Johnson labels Chequers plan as Tory conference opens The Conservative party conference starts today and, as is traditional, they are fighting like ferrets in a sack over Europe. But even by the standards of the Tories, this week political internecine warfare may turn out to be particularly severe. It could also determine the fate of Brexit . The Sunday Times has probably the most dramatic scene-setting headline. Given that just two days ago Boris Johnson , the former foreign secretary, published a word article in the Daily Telegraph rubbishing Theresa May Chequers plan for Brexit and proposing his own “SuperCanada” plan instead, this might not seem very new. But Johnson has ramped up his rhetoric. In an interview with the Sunday Times (paywall), he described the customs aspects of the Chequers plan as “deranged”. He told the paper: The idea that we could ask customs officers in Dubrovnik and Santander to charge British-only tariffs is deranged, and nobody thinks it can work. There will be economic and political damage to the UK if we go with Chequers. It surrenders control. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson said the UK should build a bridge to Ireland and put the High Speed rail line on hold to focus on a high-speed link in the north of England. In remarks that will fuel speculation about Mr Johnson leadership ambitions, he highlighted a key distinction between himself and Mrs May: “Unlike the Prime Minister, I campaigned for Brexit.” Claiming he may be able to strike a better deal than Mrs May, he told the newspaper: “Unlike the Prime Minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in We’ll get May response in about two hours, when she gives an interview to Andrew Marr . I’ll post more from the Johnson Sunday Times interview soon. Here is the agenda for the day. Brandon Lewis, the Conservative chairman, and David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, are among the guests on Sky Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Theresa May is interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show. Brandon Lewis formally opens the conference. Then there will be speeches from Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary and Jeremy Hunt , the foreign secretary.

18,"Brandon Lewis, the Conservative chairman, is speaking to the conference now. He has just said he wants the Tories to become “the natural home for ethnic minority communities within a generation”. I will post a full summary soon. Lunchtime summary Theresa May has refused to rule out further compromises in order to broker a final deal with the EU, but hit back at Boris Johnson after the former foreign secretary questioned her belief in Brexit. Senior Tories have rounded on Boris Johnson after he used a pre-conference interview to describe May Chequers plan as “deranged”. Ruth Davidson , the Scottish Conservative leader, called for a period of silence from him. Asked about his views on the BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, she said: There been time over the last two years for debate. The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as last year. Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country. In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one. David Davis , the former Brexit secretary, said that some of Johnson domestic policy ideas wouldn’t “do much good”. (See And Sajid Javid , the home secretary, mocked his call for a bridge to be built to Ireland. (See May has refused to apologise for the “hostile environment” policies she introduced that contributed to the Windrush scandal. (See In response, Diane Abbott , the shadow home secretary, said: Theresa May refusal to apologise for her hostile environment policy is disgusting. It is astonishing that the prime minister doesn’t care to know how many people have been denied access to healthcare or lost their homes. May has announced plans to impose a higher stamp duty on foreigners buying property in the UK, with the revenue being used to help tackle homelessness . (See Labour claimed that this was “a poorly-targeted rehash” of a proposal in Labour manifesto for an offshore company property, a tax on property purchased by offshore trusts located in tax havens. Brandon Lewis, the Conservative chairman, has said that only a “limitd number” of people were affected by a security breach in the party conference app that made private personal data of those attending the conference accessible. Referring to what happened, he said: Any breach of data is a serious matter and that why we are taking it seriously. We are investigating, and we have already contacted the Information Commissioner, and will be putting in a fuller report to them. We’ve spoken to the company that supplied it, who themselves have put out a statement apologising for the error that they made. This will affect people where somebody has guessed or already known somebody email address and was therefore able to log in as them. So, it will be a limited number of our delegates here and we are contacting the delegates to outline to them what has happened and what they can do about that. Sajid Javid mocks Boris proposal for bridge to Ireland Sajid Javid , the home secretary, has joined those mocking Boris Johnson for his latest bridge proposal.(See Presumably the Boris Johnson bridge to Northern Ireland is in addition to the one he wants to build to France. David Davis predicts there will be Brexit deal, but says next few months will get During his interview with Sky Sophy Ridge on Sunday, David Davis , the former Brexit secretary, predicted that there would be a Brexit deal - but that things would get “very scary” before then. He explained: I think it is likely there will be a deal and I think actually the deal with end up as something like what Boris calls “SuperCanada”, what somebody else called free trade bluff – basically a free trade [deal], but we are going to have a very scary few months, between now and about November is going to be really scary. Everyone is going to be calling each other bluff, there is all sorts of brinkmanship going to go on. That normal, that the European Union daily bread and that what we’ve got to be ready for. Liam Fox claims treatment of Theresa May has been the Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, was on Radio Live Pienaar Politics this morning. Here are some of the key points he made. Fox claimed that the way the EU has treated Theresa May has been “beyond the pale”. He said: Under article of the Lisbon treaty, they have a duty to help us deal with that future relationship. Taunting the prime minister in the way that they did post-Salzburg, which I have said was beyond the pale, is not an appropriate way to proceed. Fox seemed to be referring to this Donald Tusk instagram post . He said Brexit would cause a “short-term blip” in investment in the UK. He said: I have just come back from Canada, talking to pension funds in Canada about their investments in the UK and they say that Brexit is a short-term blip in terms of a long-term investment portfolio. He said he would be willing to serve under Boris Johnson if Johnson became party leader. “I would have no problem with serving under any duly-elected leader of the Conservative party,” Fox said. Best for Britain campaigners are marching through Birmingham city centre in protest over Brexit . As the Press Association reports, hundreds of protesters snaked through the streets chanting “bollocks to Brexit”. The march is being staged near to the Conservative party conference. Theresa May has tweeted this about her meeting with the national Conservative convention. (See This morning there was a members-only meeting of the national Conservative convention at the conference, from which journalists were excluded. According to the Sun Harry Cole, Theresa May confused activists by claiming that the EU has not rejected Chequers. Here is some more reaction to Theresa May interview with Andrew Marr . From the Guardian Jessica Elgot From the Spectator James Forsyth And this is from Forsyth blog. May did talk briefly about her plans to levy a higher level of stamp duty on foreign buyers, and how that could help more British families get on the housing ladder. But there was no big new announcement that Marr would have felt obliged to ask her about. There was also a broader lack of a positive message about either Brexit or domestic policy. I suspect that this interview will have reinforced Tory concerns that they don’t currently have an adequate response to either Corbyn agenda or voters’ concerns. From the Daily Telegraph Gordon Rayner From the Independent Nigel Morris From ITV Piers Morgan Theresa Marr interview - Summary and analysis When Andrew Marr interviewed Jeremy Corbyn in Liverpool last week, he devoted much of it to antisemitism and invited Corbyn (without much success) to deliver some form of mea culpa on air to the Jewish community. Today the most interesting part of his interview with Theresa May came when he asked her to give own apology to the Windrush migrants. Again, he did not get a proper apology, but it made for compelling TV. Perhaps it says something about the state of our politics that both main leaders are having to spend so much of their time finding off calls to say sorry. I’m sure it wasn’t always quite like this. Overall, it was a very defensive interview. The general assumption is that you are supposed to use these opportunities to announce something newsy. But the housing announcement put out by the Tories overnight (see got just a minimal reference, and otherwise it was mostly Windrush and Brexit, on both of which May was on the back foot. Here is the main line on Windrush. May refused to apologise for introducing the “hostile environment” immigration policies that led to Windrush migrants losing jobs or benefits or worse. Marr played a clip featuring Sarah O’Connor, one of the Windrush victims who recently died. Responding to this, May said: I can only apologise for what Sarah went through, and for what her family have gone through. This shouldn’t have happened. We are doing everything we can to ensure that we are supporting those who have found themselves in difficulties as a result of being part of the Windrush generation, of not having the documents that guaranteed their status. May also stressed that some of the problems started before she came to office. If you look at what has happened to the Windrush generation, actually there are people who found themselves in some difficulty without documents before we came into government. But Marr pressed her to explain what she was actually apologising for. For the fact that something bad happened? Or for the fact that her own policy was to blame? (This question should be compulsory whenever a politician apologises in an interview.) At this point May made it clear that she was not apologising for the “hostile environment” measures she introduced. She said: For most people, they do want to know that the government is taking action against those people who come to this country illegally or who stay in this country illegally. What we need to do is make sure that, in doing that, we don’t find people who have every right to be here being caught up in it. And, when pressed as to whether she was apologising for what she did, she replied: The purpose of the policy was - and we maintain a compliant environment policy - is to ensure that those people who are here illegally are identified and appropriate action is taken. I apologise for the fact that some people who should not have been caught up in that were caught up in that with, in some cases, tragic results. May refused to say how many Windrush migrants had lost their homes, lost access to NHS treatment or lost their jobs as a result of the government “hostile environment” immigration policies. And here are the main lines on Brexit . May did not have anything particularly new to say on Brexit, although that in itself was noteworthy. On the basis of her remarks, the prospect of there being a no deal Brexit does not seem to be decreasing. It probably a good job that foreign exchange traders have got the day off. May could not give a firm guarantee that there would be no hard border in Ireland in the event of a no deal Brexit. When it was put to her that, in these circumstances, there would have to be a hard border, she replied: If we leave with no deal, we as the United Kingdom government are still committed to doing everything we can to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. She refused to rule out agreeing to alter aspects of her Brexit Chequers plan, but she stressed that she wanted to hear what the EU was saying first. She implied that she did not fully understand the EU objections to Chequers. She said: The point is very simple. Until we know what their [the EU] problem is - that what we need; we need to know what their concerns are. This was curious because the EU says it has been telling the UK in private for weeks what it finds unacceptable about Chequers. She brushed aside Boris Johnson description of her Chequers plan as “deranged”, but did not comment specifically on his languge.

19,"Brandon Lewis, the Conservative chairman, is speaking to the conference now. He has just said he wants the Tories to become “the natural home for ethnic minority communities within a generation”. I will post a full summary soon. Lunchtime summary Theresa May has refused to rule out further compromises in order to broker a final deal with the EU, but hit back at Boris Johnson after the former foreign secretary questioned her belief in Brexit. Senior Tories have rounded on Boris Johnson after he used a pre-conference interview to describe May Chequers plan as “deranged”. Ruth Davidson , the Scottish Conservative leader, called for a period of silence from him. Asked about his views on the BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, she said: There been time over the last two years for debate. The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as last year. Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country. In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one. David Davis , the former Brexit secretary, said that some of Johnson domestic policy ideas wouldn’t “do much good”. (See And Sajid Javid , the home secretary, mocked his call for a bridge to be built to Ireland. (See May has refused to apologise for the “hostile environment” policies she introduced that contributed to the Windrush scandal. (See In response, Diane Abbott , the shadow home secretary, said: Theresa May refusal to apologise for her hostile environment policy is disgusting. It is astonishing that the prime minister doesn’t care to know how many people have been denied access to healthcare or lost their homes. May has announced plans to impose a higher stamp duty on foreigners buying property in the UK, with the revenue being used to help tackle homelessness . (See Labour claimed that this was “a poorly-targeted rehash” of a proposal in Labour manifesto for an offshore company property, a tax on property purchased by offshore trusts located in tax havens. Brandon Lewis, the Conservative chairman, has said that only a “limitd number” of people were affected by a security breach in the party conference app that made private personal data of those attending the conference accessible. Referring to what happened, he said: Any breach of data is a serious matter and that why we are taking it seriously. We are investigating, and we have already contacted the Information Commissioner, and will be putting in a fuller report to them. We’ve spoken to the company that supplied it, who themselves have put out a statement apologising for the error that they made. This will affect people where somebody has guessed or already known somebody email address and was therefore able to log in as them. So, it will be a limited number of our delegates here and we are contacting the delegates to outline to them what has happened and what they can do about that. Sajid Javid mocks Boris proposal for bridge to Ireland Sajid Javid , the home secretary, has joined those mocking Boris Johnson for his latest bridge proposal.(See Presumably the Boris Johnson bridge to Northern Ireland is in addition to the one he wants to build to France. David Davis predicts there will be Brexit deal, but says next few months will get During his interview with Sky Sophy Ridge on Sunday, David Davis , the former Brexit secretary, predicted that there would be a Brexit deal - but that things would get “very scary” before then. He explained: I think it is likely there will be a deal and I think actually the deal with end up as something like what Boris calls “SuperCanada”, what somebody else called free trade bluff – basically a free trade [deal], but we are going to have a very scary few months, between now and about November is going to be really scary. Everyone is going to be calling each other bluff, there is all sorts of brinkmanship going to go on. That normal, that the European Union daily bread and that what we’ve got to be ready for. Liam Fox claims treatment of Theresa May has been the Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, was on Radio Live Pienaar Politics this morning. Here are some of the key points he made. Fox claimed that the way the EU has treated Theresa May has been “beyond the pale”. He said: Under article of the Lisbon treaty, they have a duty to help us deal with that future relationship. Taunting the prime minister in the way that they did post-Salzburg, which I have said was beyond the pale, is not an appropriate way to proceed. Fox seemed to be referring to this Donald Tusk instagram post . He said Brexit would cause a “short-term blip” in investment in the UK. He said: I have just come back from Canada, talking to pension funds in Canada about their investments in the UK and they say that Brexit is a short-term blip in terms of a long-term investment portfolio. He said he would be willing to serve under Boris Johnson if Johnson became party leader. “I would have no problem with serving under any duly-elected leader of the Conservative party,” Fox said. Best for Britain campaigners are marching through Birmingham city centre in protest over Brexit . As the Press Association reports, hundreds of protesters snaked through the streets chanting “bollocks to Brexit”. The march is being staged near to the Conservative party conference. Theresa May has tweeted this about her meeting with the national Conservative convention. (See This morning there was a members-only meeting of the national Conservative convention at the conference, from which journalists were excluded. According to the Sun Harry Cole, Theresa May confused activists by claiming that the EU has not rejected Chequers. Here is some more reaction to Theresa May interview with Andrew Marr . From the Guardian Jessica Elgot From the Spectator James Forsyth And this is from Forsyth blog. May did talk briefly about her plans to levy a higher level of stamp duty on foreign buyers, and how that could help more British families get on the housing ladder. But there was no big new announcement that Marr would have felt obliged to ask her about. There was also a broader lack of a positive message about either Brexit or domestic policy. I suspect that this interview will have reinforced Tory concerns that they don’t currently have an adequate response to either Corbyn agenda or voters’ concerns. From the Daily Telegraph Gordon Rayner From the Independent Nigel Morris From ITV Piers Morgan Theresa Marr interview - Summary and analysis When Andrew Marr interviewed Jeremy Corbyn in Liverpool last week, he devoted much of it to antisemitism and invited Corbyn (without much success) to deliver some form of mea culpa on air to the Jewish community. Today the most interesting part of his interview with Theresa May came when he asked her to give own apology to the Windrush migrants. Again, he did not get a proper apology, but it made for compelling TV. Perhaps it says something about the state of our politics that both main leaders are having to spend so much of their time finding off calls to say sorry. I’m sure it wasn’t always quite like this. Overall, it was a very defensive interview. The general assumption is that you are supposed to use these opportunities to announce something newsy. But the housing announcement put out by the Tories overnight (see got just a minimal reference, and otherwise it was mostly Windrush and Brexit, on both of which May was on the back foot. Here is the main line on Windrush. May refused to apologise for introducing the “hostile environment” immigration policies that led to Windrush migrants losing jobs or benefits or worse. Marr played a clip featuring Sarah O’Connor, one of the Windrush victims who recently died. Responding to this, May said: I can only apologise for what Sarah went through, and for what her family have gone through. This shouldn’t have happened. We are doing everything we can to ensure that we are supporting those who have found themselves in difficulties as a result of being part of the Windrush generation, of not having the documents that guaranteed their status. May also stressed that some of the problems started before she came to office. If you look at what has happened to the Windrush generation, actually there are people who found themselves in some difficulty without documents before we came into government. But Marr pressed her to explain what she was actually apologising for. For the fact that something bad happened? Or for the fact that her own policy was to blame? (This question should be compulsory whenever a politician apologises in an interview.) At this point May made it clear that she was not apologising for the “hostile environment” measures she introduced. She said: For most people, they do want to know that the government is taking action against those people who come to this country illegally or who stay in this country illegally. What we need to do is make sure that, in doing that, we don’t find people who have every right to be here being caught up in it. And, when pressed as to whether she was apologising for what she did, she replied: The purpose of the policy was - and we maintain a compliant environment policy - is to ensure that those people who are here illegally are identified and appropriate action is taken. I apologise for the fact that some people who should not have been caught up in that were caught up in that with, in some cases, tragic results. May refused to say how many Windrush migrants had lost their homes, lost access to NHS treatment or lost their jobs as a result of the government “hostile environment” immigration policies. And here are the main lines on Brexit . May did not have anything particularly new to say on Brexit, although that in itself was noteworthy. On the basis of her remarks, the prospect of there being a no deal Brexit does not seem to be decreasing. It probably a good job that foreign exchange traders have got the day off.

20,"Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has warned the EU that the UK will turn belligerent in the Brexit negotiations if Brussels maintains it uncompromising stance. In remarks directly addressed to EU leaders, he said: “If you put a country like Britain in a corner, we don’t crumble. We fight.” The remarks in a wide-ranging speech that also included a well-received passage celebrating British exceptionalism. He said: The real reason for our success goes beyond ... anything tangible. It because of a few simple ideas that started here, on this small island, and went on to conquer every corner of the planet. One of those simple British ideas was free trade, a stroke of genius that was written into life by Adam Smith in Glasgow and exported across the seas by the Royal Navy. Another British idea was the fragile and beautiful insight that power should pass from leader to leader not by force, but peacefully through a franchise expressing the will of the people. The long journey to parliamentary democracy that started with Magna Carta. The speech was seen as boosting Hunt standing as a possible future leader. Speakers at the Conservative conference have strongly attacked EU leaders for the manner in which they dismissed Theresa May Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit earlier this month. Liam Fox , the international trade secretary, said: I’m sure that I wasn’t the only one after Salzburg, to feel that taunting Theresa May , one of the most unfailingly polite people I know, was absolutely beyond the pale. And Digby Jones , the former CBI boss, told the conference: I thought they showed themselves for what they are, bully boys, by their behaviour to our prime minister in Salzburg. I thought it was disgusting. Jones comment was widely applauded (even thought there was nothing new about what EU leaders said about Chequers at Salzburg; it was just the tone that was more negative than No anticipated). Jones was addressing the conference as a Birmingham dignitary, not as a party member, but he sounded as if he might have been a Tory as he praised Brexit lavishly. EU leaders have probably been advised to ignore anything said at this conference, on the grounds that it is just party politics and Tory activists are being indulged, but remarks like Hunt, Fox and Jones probably don’t make eventual compromise any easier. Fox has said that a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn would be a “colossal threat” to the next generation and warned Conservatives failed to spell this out at the last election. In his speech he said: Let me tell you what global investors really fear. They fear a Corbyn Labour government that would steal their investments and call it nationalisation They fear the dark forces bubbling under the surface of the hard-left - anti-wealth, anti-trade and antisemitic. A party which is not the future of the young but the betrayers of the young, whose reckless spending plans would leave an economic wasteland and a generation or more of debt to be repaid. Frankly, we failed to spell that out at the last election. We must now call out Corbyn hard-left Labour party for what they actually are, a colossal threat to the next generation and to the security and wellbeing of our country itself. Brexiter Tory MPs have renewed their calls for Theresa May to abandon her Chequers plan. At a Leave Means Leave rally, Peter Bone said: I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers. And Andrea Jenkyn s said: I am simply saying: prime minister, listen to the people. Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition not going to vote for it, it unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place. Please drop Chequers and start listening. Digby Jones has dismissed Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, as an “irrelevant and offensive person” because of Johnson apparent hostility towards business. (See Jones said this in a speech that was very well received by the hall. But Johnson is not the only Brexiter to criticise corporate opinion. In his speech Jones himself criticised the Financial Times newspaper for being too pro-Brussels, and the former Brexit minister Steve Baker described the CBI as “a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK” in a newspaper article. (See Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, has said the Ministry of Defence is set to recruit a teenage “cyber cadet” force which to help guard the nation against online attacks. (See The Conservatives could “go out of business as a political party” unless they re-engage with the needs of younger and minority ethnic voters, some of its own MPs have warned at the start of a party conference set to wrestle with the problem. That all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at BST Updated at BST Here is some Twitter comment on the Jeremy Hunt speech. From ITV Robert Peston From the Economist Jeremy Cliffe From the Spectator James Forsyth From the New Statesman Patrick Maguire Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit , is speaking at a BrexitCentral fringe this evening. It is probably the most popular meeting of the day. Here are some tweets. This is from the BBC Laura Kuenssberg. This is from ITV Daniel Hewitt. Gove says a no deal Brexit is something I would contemplate with glad Rajeev Syal Michael Gove has claimed that the UK will not lower its environmental or wildlife standards after Brexit but expressed concerns about the possibility that no deal will be struck with the EU. The environment secretary told a fringe event at Conservative party conference that it was an advantage for Britain to be known for quality food products and that the government would announce a food strategy later this year. Asked by World Wildlife Fund CEO Tanya Steele if he worried about ‘no deal”, Gove said: Well I do worry about it. I think that a deal would be much, much better. I think if we left without a deal, we and the EU would put in place all sorts of arrangements to make sure that the impact was mitigated. But it certainly not my favourite option. We’ve been talking about some of the things that we would need to do both constitutionally and in other respects in order to make sure that the ambitions that we have for the environment are met. I don’t think intrinsically a no deal Brexit with the right policies is harmful to the environment. I think we can do the right thing with our own legislation and the international commitments that we make, but it would certainly be the case that it would be disruptive initially and that would be a difficult period. We in government are seeking to be prepared for every eventuality, but it certainly not something I would contemplate with a glad heart. Here is an interesting take from the Sun Tom Newton Dunn on Theresa May interview earlier. Hunt says UK will if EU refuses to compromise in Brexit talks And here are two more lines from Jeremy Hunt speech about Brexit . Hunt said the UK would “fight” if the EU did not compromise in the Brexit talks. He said: And let me say one more thing about these talks. Never mistake British politeness for British weakness. Because if you put a country like Britain in a corner, we don’t crumble. We fight. Hunt did not explain what he meant by “fight” - although obviously he was not talking about deploying the new HMS Birmingham. (See (Hunt has used the line about not mistaking politeness for weakness before, although arguably the misunderstanding is his, not the EU. The UK has compromised more than the EU in the Brexit negotiations so far; Hunt words imply that that is because of politeness, but it more realistic to attribute it to the weakness of the government position.) He said the EU was failing to respond to the causes of Brexit. Punishing Britain for Brexit is dealing with the symptoms of the problem and not the cause, which is the failure of political elites across Europe - including people like me in Britain - to deal with people concerns about migration. That is the heart of the problem - and if you’re worried about the EU future that is also the solution. of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Conservatives Conservative conference Conservative conference Theresa May Boris Johnson",1437,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/30/tory-conference-brexit-theresa-may-marr-boris-johnson-labels-mays-chequers-plan-as-deranged-as-tory-conference-opens-politics-live?page=with:block-5bb104d5e4b06b7d55e2a3ec#block-5bb104d5e4b06b7d55e2a3ec
21,"Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is speaking to the conference now. He had some firm things to say about Brexit . In a passage where he said he was addressing the UK “European friends” directly, he said if they tried to punish the UK for leaving the EU, other countries who leave too. At the moment you seem to think the way to keep the club together is to punish a member who leaves. Not just with economic disruption. But even by breaking up the United Kingdom with a border down the Irish Sea. What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream? The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving. The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish it will grow … … and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to escape … If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister … … you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom and more opportunities than ever in history. … and a setback for the EU will become a wholly avoidable tragedy for Europe. Changes to business rates could be made to recognise the importance of protecting the high street, Greg Clark, the business secretary, has said. As the Press Association reports, Clark said he believed the benefits to communities from high streets should be recognised, and suggested changes to the tax on business properties was “one way of doing that”. He told a fringe event: Clearly the high street is going to change and so planning rules and regulations have to roll with that change to allow the reshaping of high streets, and we are seeing people living in town centres for example, different uses - that is very important and we should adapt to it better. Business rates is a factor and that something that the retailers do say, we’ve made a commitment, the chancellor is conducting a review of business rates. My own view is that it is I think a presence on a high street, quite apart from the turnover that it has, I think makes a big contribution to the community, and to villages, towns and cities - and I think some recognition of that is required. Business rates will be one way of doing that. Service personnel to get career development plans and ID cards for when they leave so their service recognised Gavin Williamson , the defence secretary, has not delivered his speech to the conference yet, but the party has already sent out a press notice about it, with no embargo, so here are the announcements he is making. Williamson announces an overhaul of welfare support for members of the armed forces, including ensuring that personnel get their own career development plans and ID cards to allow veterans to prove they have been in the forces when they enter civilian life. There will also be a new fund “dedicated to supporting the careers of the spouses and civil partners of those who serve, in recognition of the vital role of families within the military community”, Williamson will say. The press notice says: By the end of all serving personnel will have access to their own Professional and Personal Development Plan – a new scheme that will enable them to hone the skills they need to succeed throughout their service, and equip them for the next stage in their careers. Providing an extra layer of care for those preparing to leave the military, the new Defence Transition Service will deliver specialist support for serving personnel who are most likely to face challenges as they adjust to civilian life. These individuals will be offered unique solutions to the challenges they face, including help with housing or employment. To further support the transition to civilian life, the Defence Secretary also announced that new ID cards will be available to military service leavers shortly. The ID cards will initially be given to everyone leaving the Armed Forces, and will give them instant recognition for their service to the country. Williamson says he is setting up a scheme to train cadets in cyber warfare. The press notice explains: The Cadets CyberFirst programme, delivered by Ministry of Defence cadet organisations and the GCHQ National Cyber Security Centre, will equip over cadets a year with the skills and expertise to become future leaders in this emerging industry. Over will be invested in the programme each year, giving cadets the opportunity to learn how to protect systems connected to the internet from cyber attacks. Cadets will be able to choose from introductory courses covering the tools, knowledge and skills to protect small networks, to more advanced courses where they will be fully immersed in cyber security issues. He says the UK will maintain a military presence in Germany beyond “Around British Army personnel and Ministry of Defence civilians will remain in Germany, once the withdrawal of British Army units to the UK has been completed,” the party says. He announces that a new navy frigate will be named HMS Birmingham. CBI menace to political stability and economic prospects of says former Brexit minister If Digby Jones is unhappy about Conservatives who don’t take the concerns of business seriously (see , he probably need to widen his list of targets. There has been more evidence today of how Brexit pushing a wedge between the Conservative party and corporate Britain it used to represent. In an article for the Sunday Telegraph (paywall), Steve Baker , the former Brexit minister, describes the CBI (Jones former employer) as “a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK”. He writes: Today, the CBI is a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK. I choose that term deliberately. When Hayek attacked economists for making the intellectual error of concentrating on superficial short-run effects at the expense of the long-term forces of economic life, he called them “a grave menace to our civilisation”. So it is with the CBI. The CBI is to blame for the Brexit talks being in a dire state, Baker claims. Eventually came the catastrophe of Chequers. Timid and afraid, a terrified Establishment who never understood the demand for independence have clung too close to EU institutions . With Marxists opposite, hungry for power and all the ruin that would bring, the Tory party is riven and a rule-bound EU has inevitably rejected a proposal incompatible with their legal order. This grave threat facing our country is the triumph of the CBI. It is the product of the CBI conservatism and willingness to grasp passing expedients. More anti-business sentiment has surfaced in the conference this afternoon. So far here have been two moments when speakers have attacked a newspaper, to the delight of the audience. Not the Guardian. (We probably get booed more by the hardcore Corbynistas.) The jibes, which came from Jones and Liam Fox , were directed at the Financial Times - the house journal of FTSE-world. Michael Gove , the environment secretary, thinks a bit like this too. We have not heard from him today, but in Tom Baldwin excellent new book about politics and the media, Ctrl Alt Delete , he quotes Gove as saying: My view is that the Sirs and Dames and the captains of industry more often than not tend to be complacent … If you are the chairman of a FTSE company, then I tend to think you’re probably wrong. Digby Jones dismisses Boris Johnson as and The most blunt (public) response to Boris Johnson so far was delivered by Digby Jones , the former CBI general secretary, who gave a speech welcoming members to Birmingham in his capacity as a peer from Birmingham. Jones kept stressing that he was not a member of a political party, but his speech was strongly pro-Brexit (he once addressed a Ukip conference) and he sounded - well, quite at home with his audience. The anti-Johnson jibe came when he was speaking about the importance of business. He said he “took exception” to the reports that Johnson had said “fuck business” when asked about business concerns about Brexit earlier this year. He went on: Business is so important that when I heard a former foreign secretary f-business, it showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is. Updated at BST Brandon Lewis says he wants Tories to be home for ethnic minority communities within Here are the main points from Brandon Lewis speech to the conference. Lewis, the Conservative chair, said that he wanted the Tories to become “the natural home for ethnic minority communities within a generation”. He said: Our greatest challenge still lies ahead: winning more support from black, asian and minority ethnic communities. I don’t underestimate the size of this task. Our vote among ethnic minority voters is stalling. Yet we can be their natural home. Because these are the people who have done so much to build Britain. years ago, in the first world war, at least Indians volunteered to fight for the British army. years ago, many travelled from around the world to make their home in this country and help build our fantastic NHS. Today, Muslim communities in Britain give more to charity than any other group – donating around million to charities every year, a stunning example to us all. And the values that these things speak to – country, aspiration, self-reliance, hard-work – are our values too. They are Conservative values. So I want us to become the natural home for ethnic minority communities within a generation. He announced a mentoring fund for people under-represented in the Conservative party. Today I can announce that we are establishing a dedicated mentoring fund to support those who are under-represented in our party. A fund to provide guidance and training to help them pursue a life in public service, and to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds to stand for parliament, become MPs and help us truly represent the face of modern Britain. He said he had set a target for of people on the candidates’ list to be women.

CBI menace to political stability and economic prospects of says former Brexit minister If Digby Jones is unhappy about Conservatives who don’t take the concerns of business seriously (see , he probably need to widen his list of targets. There has been more evidence today of how Brexit pushing a wedge between the Conservative party and corporate Britain it used to represent. In an article for the Sunday Telegraph (paywall), Steve Baker , the former Brexit minister, describes the CBI (Jones former employer) as “a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK”. He writes: Today, the CBI is a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK. I choose that term deliberately. When Hayek attacked economists for making the intellectual error of concentrating on superficial short-run effects at the expense of the long-term forces of economic life, he called them “a grave menace to our civilisation”. So it is with the CBI. The CBI is to blame for the Brexit talks being in a dire state, Baker claims. Eventually came the catastrophe of Chequers. Timid and afraid, a terrified Establishment who never understood the demand for independence have clung too close to EU institutions . With Marxists opposite, hungry for power and all the ruin that would bring, the Tory party is riven and a rule-bound EU has inevitably rejected a proposal incompatible with their legal order. This grave threat facing our country is the triumph of the CBI. It is the product of the CBI conservatism and willingness to grasp passing expedients. More anti-business sentiment has surfaced in the conference this afternoon. So far here have been two moments when speakers have attacked a newspaper, to the delight of the audience. Not the Guardian. (We probably get booed more by the hardcore Corbynistas.) The jibes, which came from Jones and Liam Fox , were directed at the Financial Times - the house journal of FTSE-world. Michael Gove , the environment secretary, thinks a bit like this too. We have not heard from him today, but in Tom Baldwin excellent new book about politics and the media, Ctrl Alt Delete , he quotes Gove as saying: My view is that the Sirs and Dames and the captains of industry more often than not tend to be complacent … If you are the chairman of a FTSE company, then I tend to think you’re probably wrong. Digby Jones dismisses Boris Johnson as and The most blunt (public) response to Boris Johnson so far was delivered by Digby Jones , the former CBI general secretary, who gave a speech welcoming members to Birmingham in his capacity as a peer from Birmingham. Jones kept stressing that he was not a member of a political party, but his speech was strongly pro-Brexit (he once addressed a Ukip conference) and he sounded - well, quite at home with his audience. The anti-Johnson jibe came when he was speaking about the importance of business. He said he “took exception” to the reports that Johnson had said “fuck business” when asked about business concerns about Brexit earlier this year. He went on: Business is so important that when I heard a former foreign secretary f-business, it showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is. Updated at BST Brandon Lewis says he wants Tories to be home for ethnic minority communities within Here are the main points from Brandon Lewis speech to the conference. Lewis, the Conservative chair, said that he wanted the Tories to become “the natural home for ethnic minority communities within a generation”. He said: Our greatest challenge still lies ahead: winning more support from black, asian and minority ethnic communities. I don’t underestimate the size of this task. Our vote among ethnic minority voters is stalling. Yet we can be their natural home. Because these are the people who have done so much to build Britain. years ago, in the first world war, at least Indians volunteered to fight for the British army. years ago, many travelled from around the world to make their home in this country and help build our fantastic NHS. Today, Muslim communities in Britain give more to charity than any other group – donating around million to charities every year, a stunning example to us all. And the values that these things speak to – country, aspiration, self-reliance, hard-work – are our values too. They are Conservative values. So I want us to become the natural home for ethnic minority communities within a generation. He announced a mentoring fund for people under-represented in the Conservative party. Today I can announce that we are establishing a dedicated mentoring fund to support those who are under-represented in our party. A fund to provide guidance and training to help them pursue a life in public service, and to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds to stand for parliament, become MPs and help us truly represent the face of modern Britain. He said he had set a target for of people on the candidates’ list to be women.

23,"Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is speaking to the conference now. He had some firm things to say about Brexit . In a passage where he said he was addressing the UK “European friends” directly, he said if they tried to punish the UK for leaving the EU, other countries who leave too. At the moment you seem to think the way to keep the club together is to punish a member who leaves. Not just with economic disruption. But even by breaking up the United Kingdom with a border down the Irish Sea. What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream? The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving. The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish it will grow … … and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to escape … If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister … … you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom and more opportunities than ever in history. … and a setback for the EU will become a wholly avoidable tragedy for Europe. Changes to business rates could be made to recognise the importance of protecting the high street, Greg Clark, the business secretary, has said. As the Press Association reports, Clark said he believed the benefits to communities from high streets should be recognised, and suggested changes to the tax on business properties was “one way of doing that”. He told a fringe event: Clearly the high street is going to change and so planning rules and regulations have to roll with that change to allow the reshaping of high streets, and we are seeing people living in town centres for example, different uses - that is very important and we should adapt to it better. Business rates is a factor and that something that the retailers do say, we’ve made a commitment, the chancellor is conducting a review of business rates. My own view is that it is I think a presence on a high street, quite apart from the turnover that it has, I think makes a big contribution to the community, and to villages, towns and cities - and I think some recognition of that is required. Business rates will be one way of doing that. Service personnel to get career development plans and ID cards for when they leave so their service recognised Gavin Williamson , the defence secretary, has not delivered his speech to the conference yet, but the party has already sent out a press notice about it, with no embargo, so here are the announcements he is making. Williamson announces an overhaul of welfare support for members of the armed forces, including ensuring that personnel get their own career development plans and ID cards to allow veterans to prove they have been in the forces when they enter civilian life. There will also be a new fund “dedicated to supporting the careers of the spouses and civil partners of those who serve, in recognition of the vital role of families within the military community”, Williamson will say. The press notice says: By the end of all serving personnel will have access to their own Professional and Personal Development Plan – a new scheme that will enable them to hone the skills they need to succeed throughout their service, and equip them for the next stage in their careers. Providing an extra layer of care for those preparing to leave the military, the new Defence Transition Service will deliver specialist support for serving personnel who are most likely to face challenges as they adjust to civilian life. These individuals will be offered unique solutions to the challenges they face, including help with housing or employment. To further support the transition to civilian life, the Defence Secretary also announced that new ID cards will be available to military service leavers shortly. The ID cards will initially be given to everyone leaving the Armed Forces, and will give them instant recognition for their service to the country. Williamson says he is setting up a scheme to train cadets in cyber warfare. The press notice explains: The Cadets CyberFirst programme, delivered by Ministry of Defence cadet organisations and the GCHQ National Cyber Security Centre, will equip over cadets a year with the skills and expertise to become future leaders in this emerging industry. Over will be invested in the programme each year, giving cadets the opportunity to learn how to protect systems connected to the internet from cyber attacks. Cadets will be able to choose from introductory courses covering the tools, knowledge and skills to protect small networks, to more advanced courses where they will be fully immersed in cyber security issues. He says the UK will maintain a military presence in Germany beyond “Around British Army personnel and Ministry of Defence civilians will remain in Germany, once the withdrawal of British Army units to the UK has been completed,” the party says. He announces that a new navy frigate will be named HMS Birmingham.

24,"Name: Conservatives for Britain. Age: Brand new. Appearance: Florid. Shouty. I thought all Conservatives were for Britain? I thought that was kinda their thing. A better Britain. A Britain. A nation of shopkeepers. Who sell jam and blitz spirit. Who aren’t migrants. That Britain. CfB, as it nattily styles itself, is a group of more than MPs who are planning to campaign for Britain to withdraw from the EU in the referendum due to be held in if David Cameron can’t negotiate better membership terms for our proud island nation. And by “better terms” they mean …? Many things, but foremost among them a return to sovereignty over our own laws. But that absolutely could never happen. We would have to withdraw completely to get that. I think you’re on the point of spotting the crux of their cunning plan. Conservative MPs ready to lead campaign for EU exit So when they say they’ll support staying in the EU if the PM secures a good deal …? They mean “Were David Cameron to find, catch and break the legs of the leprechaun within whose magical bowl this fictive, ongoing, utterly transformed UK membership of the EU is to be found, we would still want out but we would stay in if he could square the circle, build a five-sided pyramid on it and bury himself within it.” You’re saying their motives are not pure? Some of them are true believers – hardline Eurosceptics, driven to madness by Cameron claim that he, too, is such a beast while in fact positioning his government, party and country to stay completely within Brussels’ power – some have their eye on the main chance if Cameron is discredited and ousted in the months and years to come, some are double agents, some are pre-traitors, and some are quadruple agents who have forgotten what side they’re actually on. Or, to use John Major famous description of three Eurosceptic MPs in his cabinet, simply “bastards” . Has Cameron taken this massing of his own parliamentarians against him well? He seems like a man confident enough in himself and his position to take this well. He has not taken this well. He initially threatened to sack any minister who campaigns to leave the EU, before performing his own in-out manoeuvre and withdrawing the threat. Stylish. ’Tis ever the man watchword. Do say: “I do hope this doesn’t threaten the future of Cameron premiership.” Don’t say: “No more nonsense about straight bananas and beer in litres?

25,"A parliamentary watchdog censured the European Research Group, the hard-Brexit faction of Conservative MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, for using taxpayers’ money for party political activity in breach of rules. The group has received hundreds of thousands of pounds from taxpayers through the MPs’ expenses system to support its research activities. The funds cannot be used for party political purposes. In an email to the ERG last September, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) said the contents of a research note produced by the group last year amounted to political attacks on the Labour party for voting against the government European Union (withdrawal) bill. “Labour decision to vote against it is irresponsible, a breach of trust with their voters and a vote to create chaos,” said one of the passages in the briefing. The email last year to the ERG researcher, made public after a freedom of information request , said some of the group materials crossed the line into political campaigning and asked that this activity stop. Early this summer the watchdog wrote to the ERG again after a number of complaints, saying it wanted reassurance that public money was not being misspent on party political campaigning. The ERG receives taxpayer funds from MPs for its work as a “pooled service” providing research and briefings to MPs, and is not supposed to carry out political campaigning. But within the past week it has dramatically escalated its efforts to pressure the prime minister into abandoning her Chequers proposals as a basis for negotiating with the European Union. The group has reportedly drafted its own blueprint for an alternative to the prime minister negotiating position. The alternative manifesto was slated for launch this week as part of a concerted campaign to “chuck Chequers” and force the PM to make a U-turn or face a leadership challenge, until it was put on hold because of divisions within the group. The ERG is officially one of five parliamentary pooled services that conduct research for each party. MPs can claim a year each from public funds to cover the cost of this research, as long as the material they produce does not constitute party political campaigning. Fifty-three Conservative MPs have claimed subscription money from Ipsa for membership of the ERG since and the group has received around in taxpayers’ money in that period. Its membership has fluctuated, with MPs said to be on its WhatsApp group at various times. In response to last year Ipsa email, the ERG revealed that it operated a second bank account for receipt of private donations from benefactors in addition to its receipt of public money. “The non-Ipsa one pays for occasional functions, MPs’ breakfasts, drinks, etc. That it really,” it replied. The ERG has received multiple donations from private donors. Paul Dyer, a pro-Brexit businessman, donated to the group in March Earlier in the year Steve Baker, until recently a Brexit minister, reported a donation of in his capacity as ERG leader to pay for an event. No-deal Brexit could be as bad as financial crash, Carney says That money was received from the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) , a mysterious organisation of unknown membership said to be committed to pro-union causes. The CRC donated to the Democratic Unionist party ahead of the Brexit referendum, part of which the party then paid to AggregateIQ, a little-known Canadian data consultancy also used in the referendum by Vote Leave. In the ERG then researcher, Robert Broadhurst, disclosed to parliament that his salary for working for the group was financed by private donations in addition to Ipsa funds. One donor was Norman Lamont, the pro-Brexit former chancellor of the exchequer. Lord Lamont said he could not recall the specifics of his donation but he remembered contributing “about to Broadhurst salary. “I used to ring up Robert and ask him questions. I probably felt that it was wrong that I was not contributing, and MPs were,” he said. He agreed that the organisation had changed in recent years. “It has become more of a sort of campaigning thing,” Lamont said. “I supposed we all campaigned for certain things, but it did not have a collective policy. It largely consisted of having breakfast once a month and hearing from Robert Broadhurst, and making up our own minds.” An ERG spokesperson said: “We are strictly compliant with Ipsa rules.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",765,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/14/tory-brexit-faction-erg-censured-for-using-public-funds-for-campaigning
26,"Leading Brexiters have pushed back at claims that their campaign to “chuck Chequers” is going off the rails as they endorsed an alternative proposal that would result in the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group , said there was “nothing to fear” from a no-deal scenario after the pro-Brexit economist Patrick Minford claimed it could boost Treasury revenues by a year. Mogg said, however, that he would prefer the government to strike a Canada plus-style free-trade deal with Brussels to retain the benefits of leaving on “the most friendly terms we can manage”. Brexit weekly briefing: the Tories continue to tear themselves apart The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith also said the government could move on to World Trade Organization rules or opt for a “proper, substantial” free-trade deal with the EU, suggesting ministers had misled the public over the dangers of crashing out. The Brexiters tried to seize back control of their campaign, which has been overshadowed with interventions from Boris Johnson, who described the Chequers plan as a “suicide vest” , as well as his tumultuous personal life. Johnson, a surprise attendee at the event, ducked questions over whether he would be prepared to launch a leadership bid to prevent Theresa May pushing ahead with her plans. He merely pointed at a colleague and said: “What he said.” The former Brexit secretary Steve Baker said: “Isn’t the future of this country about more than personalities? This event is not about who the prime minister of this country ought to be, it about policy … I’ve not much interest in who the prime minister is.” Rees-Mogg confirmed that he would vote against the Chequers deal in the Commons but that he hoped the government would not make it a confidence matter, adding that to conflate the two would be a mistake. The former Brexit secretary David Davis was also among the leading Eurosceptics who crowded into a committee room in the House of Commons on Tuesday to back the plans drawn up by Economists for Free Trade. The prime minister has challenged the Brexiters to publish their alternative plan to Chequers but ERG members have struggled to reach agreement on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, a main sticking point in discussions with Brussels. Rees-Mogg said the ERG would on Wednesday set out a proposed solution to the border problem, which “any reasonable person” would accept. It is expected to include proposals for tax inspectors conducting spot checks in factories on goods for export. He told the gathering he wanted to strike a deal with Brussels but that the government must not be “snivelling and timorous and fearful” in talks. “If you have got nothing to fear from leaving on a world trade deal basis … then you can say we’ll have a Canada plus-style deal and have a solution to the Northern Ireland problem.” Baker, a key member of the anti-Chequers campaign who has claimed that Tory MPs would vote against the prime minister plans, said: “We are all agreed it would be preferable to leave smoothly into an agreement.” In response to claims that the UK would not have enough time to reach a free-trade deal he said: “I don’t think anybody is really suggesting that we get down to the last dot and cross on the T on a free-trade deal by exit date. We’re talking about a political statement that, if it going to satisfy colleagues in parliament, point to an advanced free-trade deal which leaves us an independent country.” Johnson, who had not been expected to speak at the event, said Chequers would be “substantially worse than the status quo” for British businesses and that he had a “particular economic objection” to them being tied to the single market. He again called on May to revert to her Lancaster House proposals. “If only she had stuck to that I think we’d be in a much better position,” he said.

27,"A rightwing thinktank has been offering potential US donors access to government ministers and civil servants as it raises cash for research to support the free-trade deals demanded by hardline Brexiters, according to an investigation. The director of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) was secretly recorded telling an undercover reporter that funders could get to know ministers on first-name terms and that his organisation was in “the Brexit influencing game”. Mark Littlewood claimed the IEA could make introductions to ministers and said the thinktank trade expert knew Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, David Davis and Liam Fox well. The IEA chief was also recorded suggesting potential US donors could fund and shape “substantial content” of research commissioned by the thinktank and that its findings would always support the argument for free-trade deals. This could hugely benefit US farmers by lifting the ban on the sale in the UK of beef from cattle treated with growth hormones and chlorine-washed chicken . Speaking about what kind of Westminster access the IEA could provide donors with, Littlewood told the investigator: “I have absolutely no problem with people who have business interests, us facilitating those.” The investigation, undertaken in May and June, also revealed the thinktank had already provided access to a minister for a US organisation. The disclosures are likely to raise fresh questions about the independence and status of the IEA, which is established as an educational charity. Charity Commission rules state that “an organisation will not be charitable if its purposes are political”. The investigation also sheds light on the way US business interests seem keen to influence the Brexit debate by bolstering the arguments of hardliners inside the Conservative party who continue to grow in strength. In lengthy exchanges with the Guardian , the IEA said there was “nothing untoward about thinktanks having a collaborative approach with politicians”, adding that it had “no corporate view” on Brexit. “It is spurious to suggest that the IEA is engaging in any kind of ‘cash for access’ system,” a spokesman said. “All thinktanks have relationships with government officials and politicians.” He said it had not accepted any cash from US business in relation to its work on trade and Brexit. Littlewood told BBC Radio Today programme on Monday that such interactions were an integral part of the IEA work and perfectly normal. “My job is to meet other free-market people to try and persuade them to give me some money so my institute can conduct free-market research so that we can influence debate and opinion in society,” he said. “Let be clear about that. I have no power over ministers. I’m not a chief whip or a leader of a party. We can’t promise people any access at all. The IEA has done spectacularly well in engaging with politicians.” Founded in the IEA describes itself as the UK original free-market thinktank. In the two years since the EU referendum, it has been a platform for those pushing for a clean-break Brexit. The footage was gathered by Unearthed, an investigations unit set up by Greenpeace amid concerns about the IEA and whether it was working behind the scenes to use Brexit to lower environmental standards. The IEA is already subject to a Charity Commission review of a complaint that its promotion of a hard Brexit is incompatible with its charitable status. A reporter from the unit posed as a consultant for a US agriculture investor, secretly taping conversations with senior IEA officials on two occasions. The recordings include discussions between Littlewood and the reporter in which the IEA director sets out the potential benefits of funding work by the thinktank. Littlewood explained that a meeting with an agriculture minister would provide him and his client with the opportunity “for you to say, ‘Minister I’m really keen to bend your ear about beef’”. It is understood the footage, which has been shared with the Guardian, will be handed to the Charity Commission on Monday. In the recordings, the IEA claimed it had arranged for Tucker Link , a business figure from Oklahoma who at the time owned a cattle ranch, to meet the Brexit minister at the time, Steve Baker. Baker left his post after David Davis resigned as Brexit secretary. A spokeswoman for Baker said he “met US Republicans in his political capacity to discuss trade relations between the two countries”. She said he only ever had meetings “on merit”, adding: “We would not want any ambiguity whatsoever to exist on this point.” Littlewood claimed the IEA also arranged for Link, and the director of an Oklahoma business thinktank, to go to the Department for International Trade, Fox department, where they met a senior civil servant. “The people running our international trade team are talking to [Gove] definitely once every three or four days … along with David Davis, Boris Johnson, Liam Fox,” Littlewood was recorded as saying. Davis, Baker and Lord Callanan, a Brexit minister, all recorded meetings with the IEA in the first three months of this year. During a pitch for funding for research, Littlewood said the IEA allowed donors to affect the “salience” of reports and to shape “substantial content”. He said the thinktank was keen to commission a study on post-Brexit farming which would focus on how changes in technology, genomics and chemicals could benefit the British countryside. The idea was to “get these ideas in the bloodstream of Defra”, Littlewood said, referring to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is run by Gove. The IEA director suggested the report would be written by Matt Ridley, a commentator on genetics in agriculture, who had already discussed the idea with Gove. The undercover reporter was given a summary of the report and a cost plan, which showed the IEA needed to produce and publicise it. It said of the sum would go towards a private lunch for the donor. Littlewood said this would be with a minister, and that a minister, “quite possibly” Gove, would also be invited to the launch. In the recording, Littlewood said IEA reports were consistent with the thinktank ideological position and he said donors could not dictate their conclusions. But he added: “There is no way this report is going to say the most important thing we need to do is keep American beef out of our market in order to prop up our beef farmers, in fact exactly the opposite.” He also suggested the report might propose allowing the UK sale of chlorine-washed chicken from the US as long as it was labelled. A spokesman for Gove confirmed Ridley had suggested the report to him. But he added: “There will be no chlorinated chicken entering the UK and we will retain the precautionary principle [used to prohibit GM farming in the EU]. That position won’t change whatever any thinktank recommends.” The IEA said Littlewood remarks about the report most likely conclusions did not mean it would be written to suit the donor interests. “We think it is likely that [Ridley] will follow the evidence, which in our view leads to the conclusion that freedom of choice is best for consumers.” An IEA spokeswoman said it was confident it had acted in accordance with the charity regulations, adding: “We do not act in donors’ interests, except to the extent that they have an interest in pursuing free trade and free markets.” Peer review meant the thinktank output was “independent and free from conflict of interest”, she said. “We are not controlling politicians in any way … When they work with us they do so of their own volition.” The IEA makes “independent editorial decisions and then seeks funding … It is surely uncontroversial that the IEA principles coincide with the interests of our donors,” it added. It said it had not received any cash from US businesses in relation to its work on trade and Brexit. The Unearthed editor, Damian Kahya, said its investigation appeared to have uncovered a campaign to lower Britain environmental standards and raised questions about whether the IEA may have failed to comply with its legal obligations. Greenpeace has repeatedly clashed with the IEA over GM farming. The IEA has argued that Greenpeace should not have charitable status because it serves “no public purpose” and has accused it of opposing GM rice “that could prevent the deaths of more than million children a year”. Greenpeace UK says it is not a registered charity, although it does have a small charitable wing. It says so-called “golden rice” is still not commercially available after more than years of research.

MP Matt Hancock releases app called Matt Hancock MP Gove picture was changed to Rupert Murdoch, his previous employer at the Times. Anyone could log in as any attendee by providing an email with no password. Many MPs had registered with their public parliamentary email addresses, making it simple for any member of the public to access their mobile number via the app. Commentators said the flaw raised questions over the ability of the government to harness technology to solve issues around the Irish border and customs checks. The app may also have breached data laws. Its privacy policy states that it “complies with … the European Union general data protection regulation (GDPR)”. The breach enraged senior ­ministers. One Whitehall source described the error as “fucking ­ridiculous”. Anger was immediately aimed at Brandon Lewis, the Tory party chairman whose duties include overseeing the conference. Labour said that the mishap raised questions around national ­security and recommended the Tories provide computer training to their members. “How can we trust this Tory government with our country security when they can’t even build a conference app that keeps the data of their members, MPs and others attending safe and secure?”, said John Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister. “The Conservative party should roll out some basic computer security training to get their house in order.” The Information Commissioner Office (ICO) said it would be ­making inquiries about the breach and added that “organisations have a legal duty to keep personal data safe and secure”. Under GDPR, organisations must notify the ICO within hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach, if it could pose a risk to people rights and freedoms. The app privacy policy states that it complies with the EU GDPR. A Momentum spokesperson criticised the “staggering incompetence” of the Conservative party and cited the success of its own in-house app during the Labour party conference this week. “This sums up the Tories, staggeringly incompetent and out of touch with the modern world,” they said. “They can’t even build a basic conference app without a huge data breach, and it terrifying that they’re in charge of the tech that runs our hospitals, schools and airports. “Our conference app was built by a team of volunteers for next to no money, and I’m sure they’d be happy to give the Tories a few tips for next year.” The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster was among the first to notice the flaw and swiftly raised the alarm on Saturday. “The Tory conference app allows you to log in as other people and view their contact details just with their email address, no emailed security links, and post comments as them,” she tweeted. “They’ve essentially made every journalist, politician and attendee mobile number public. Fantastic.” The app, created by an Australian firm called CrowdComms, was updated and the login function removed after concerns were raised with the party. The Conservative party said in a statement: “The technical issue has been resolved and the app is now functioning securely. We are investigating the issue further and apologise for any concern caused.” The prime minister, Theresa May, refused to respond to questions from reporters about the embarrassing security blunder as she arrived in Birmingham. It follows the gaffe that unfolded last year during Theresa May keynote speech when a comedian managed to get to the front of the stage and pass her a P , which she accepted. The set behind her – featuring the slogan ‘“Building a county that works for everyone”’ – soon began to fall apart, and she lost her voice, prompting the shadow chancellor, Phillip Hammond, to offer her a cough sweet.

29,"Leaders of the cross-party campaign that persuaded the British people to leave the EU have dropped their pre-referendum pledge of a spending bonanza for the NHS . Many of those who headed the Vote Leave campaign, including its former chair, Labour MP Gisela Stuart, and Michael Gove, the Tory former justice secretary, are re-forming this weekend, creating a new pressure group called Change Britain . Other top names involved in the organisation, which says it is being established to help “deliver the UK referendum result in the most effective way”, include former chancellor Nigel (Lord) Lawson, Digby Jones, former head of the CBI, and David (Lord) Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary. But despite the NHS pledge having been at the heart of their message in the run-up to the June vote, and displayed on the official Vote Leave battlebus, the Change Britain website made no mention of the NHS in its manifesto about how to make a success of Brexit . Instead, Change Britain said on its “Brexit Means Brexit” page that any savings made as a result of no longer having to pay into the EU budget (assuming the UK leaves the single market) should be spent on guaranteeing “continued funding for farming, science, universities and poorer regions of the UK”. The website was taken down, although cached versions of its pages were still accessible through search engines. Anna Soubry, the pro-Remain Tory MP and former minister for small business, said it was outrageous that the Leave campaigners had “peddled that lie” during the campaign and were now quietly abandoning it. The Remain camp argued all along that it was wrong to claim that the UK sent a week to Brussels as this is the gross figure and does not take account of the large sums of money that come back in EU farm and other subsidies, including structural funds and education and research grants. The idea that so much extra money could be guaranteed for the NHS post-Brexit was also challenged as totally unrealistic. What has happened to the leave campaign pledge for the NHS? Soubry, a leading light in Open Britain, the successor to the Remain campaign, added: “They should all hang their heads in shame. There were many people, particularly in less wealthy areas, who were convinced by Leave claim that if we left the EU we would be able to pour millions more into the NHS. The danger now is these people will become even more disillusioned with all politicians because this lot misled them.” Last weekend, prime minister Theresa May, speaking at the summit in China, said she was unable to guarantee extra money for the health service post-Brexit, and came out against a points- based immigration system – which was the other central plank of the Brexit campaigners’ pitch to voters. In an open letter, Labour MPs – including former cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw, former shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden and ex-frontbenchers Emma Reynolds and Chuka Umunna – call on the Brexit campaigners to admit the NHS pledge was a lie.“ There should be no escaping this pledge for the Leave campaign – they cannot walk away from it now, disown it or pretend it never happened. They must either admit it was a lie and apologise to their voters, or justify it.” On Saturday Downing Street made clear its annoyance with Liam Fox, the international trade secretary responsible for negotiating post-Brexit trade deals, who angered businesspeople by suggesting British executives would rather play golf than export their goods and services. Fox, a former GP and staunch Eurosceptic, told a reception for the Thatcherite group Conservative Way Forward that the UK had grown “too fat” on the successes of previous generations. Downing Street issued a curt statement saying these were Fox private opinions.

30,"Toyota has said production at its UK factories would be disrupted for weeks or maybe months if Theresa May failed to strike a Brexit deal. The Japanese manufacturer is the latest foreign carmaker to say there could be temporary stoppages and possible job losses if there are checks at Dover and Calais as a result of no agreement. “My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory,” Marvin Cooke, the managing director of the company plant in Burnaston, told the BBC. Asked how long the production stoppages would last , he said: “We can’t predict. It could be hours, days, weeks – even months.” His warning follows statements by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and BMW about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the British car manufacturing industry, which employs more than people directly and more than indirectly. Greg Clark, the business secretary, described the warning as “concerning”. He told the BBC Today programme the Chequers Brexit proposal was “a very practical set of proposals precisely calibrated to avoid those checks”. He said he disagreed with the assessment that the EU had rejected Chequers and said there would be a heavy price to pay across the EU with car manufacturers if a deal were not struck. But he admitted Britain would lose its status as one of the world leaders in car innovation without an agreement. “To see that slip through our fingers is something that we would regret for ever,” he said. Honda warns no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions The Toyota plant near Derby is one of nine the Japanese carmaker has in the UK and is the home of the Auris and Avensis models. Toyota has plans to take on new staff as part of a investment in a new production line for an updated Corolla. It produces cars worth a day, with components arriving every minutes as part of the “just-in-time” production process, which means car manufacturers do not store parts in on-site warehouses. Instead, Toyota factories rely on the smooth delivery of parts from within the UK and especially Europe, from where lorries a day cross the channel with parts for car manufacturers in Oxford, the Midlands, the north and the north-east. Cooke said the carmaker was looking at its options for storage, but checks and delays would add costs to the bottom line permanently. “It would reduce our competitiveness. Sadly, that would reduce the number of cars made in the UK and that would cost jobs,” he said. Last week, Honda said it would look to stockpile some components as a contingency measure. Earlier this month, JLR announced staff would move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant – hours after the company was accused of “scaremongering” by a Brexiter MP. BMW announced it was planning to shut its Oxfordshire plant for a month to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts.

31,"hat Ruth Davidson does not want to be prime minister ought not to make headlines, she says. “I have been asked it so many times and said it in so many ways, this isn’t actually new,” insists the Scottish Conservatives’ leader, who has been regarded with increasingly breathless fervour as a silver bullet to quell party disunity, renew Tory support across the UK and perhaps even solve Brexit, ever since David Cameron tipped her as a possible successor in But she cannot be unaware that context is all. The first openly lesbian party leader anywhere in the UK, Davidson, is less than five weeks away from giving birth to her first child, conceived with her partner, Jen, following IVF treatment. A state-educated woman with a working-class background in a party overwhelmingly controlled by privately schooled men, she has delivered previously unthinkable electoral success for the Scottish Tories at both Holyrood and Westminster. She is one of two politicians in Scotland with whom the electorate is on first-name terms – the other being the first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, whose job (as first minister) Davidson says she very much does want. With her penchant for unusual photo opportunities – Davidson has variously been snapped driving a tank, playing bagpipes and riding a buffalo – and the divertingly jolly persona, one might also venture a comparison with Boris Johnson, though ideally not while she is in the room. But if some observers have read this as a calculated attempt to stop voters connecting her with Thatcher still-toxic legacy north of the border, it seems this front may have been an attempt to distract from something altogether more personal. Last week Davidson published her first book, Yes She Can, a collection of unexpectedly revealing interviews with “mould-breaking women”, from the American philanthropist Melinda Gates to the Indian commando trainer Seema Rao. This optimistic volume also includes an intimate memoir from Davidson herself, in which she reveals that she was diagnosed with clinical depression as a teenager. That “suffocating” episode, at the age of found her cutting her arms with blades and broken glass, drinking heavily and considering suicide, and appears to have been treated with minimal insight by her university GP. She discusses the ongoing management of her mental health in very practical terms, relying on structure, exercise and measurable outcomes to her day, as well as her fears “of going back to the place I once inhabited”, especially in the crucible of the Scottish independence campaign. With publication comes publicity, and headlines such as “ Ruth Davidson: PM job would risk my mental health ”. While her honesty has been widely praised, some have questioned the implication that mental illness precludes a person from high office. “That not what I said,” Davidson is adamant. “That is the conflation, and that would be a shame because I think I’d have done a disservice to people.” She is likewise clear that she did not mean that the role of first minister of Scotland is lesser than that of prime minister: “I’ve been saying for a very long time that I’ve built a home in Edinburgh, I bought my first house last year, I’m getting married, I’m having a child.” In the Holyrood elections, Davidson won the seat of Edinburgh Central, which includes the city affluent Georgian new town and the first minister residence, Bute House, from the SNP. “I’m already the MSP for Bute House, I’d quite like to be the MSP in Bute House, thanks very much. “I’ve been saying all this stuff, but now there been some conflation [with her depression diagnosis], everyone going: ‘Oh, she must mean it now.’ Well, actually, why? Maybe we’re not as far enough along in the conversation about mental health as we think we are, if suddenly everybody is saying that has to be a full stop.” So does she anticipate a queue of wistful activists trying to change her mind when she arrives at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham this weekend? She asserts with the vigorous sincerity of a hockey captain that delegates will be “very keen to support the prime minister, because they can see that this is the real tough end of the negotiations”. OK. In her book, one of her messages to her younger self was “do not be intimidated by posh blowhards”. So what is her message to Boris Johnson for the weekend? Our conversation takes place before Johnson intervention in the Telegraph on Friday, calling again for Theresa May to “ chuck Chequers ”, but it is not an altogether flip question, given Davidson history with the former foreign secretary. During her stellar performance at the Wembley arena debate just before the EU referendum, a formidably well-briefed Davidson repeatedly challenged Johnson lazy assertions about the benefits of a leave vote, and since then she has regularly called out his disruptive behaviour over Brexit. “I was talking about a very specific time in my life,” she corrects me, “but one of the things that it helped me learn was that just because someone talks louder and brays a bit doesn’t mean that they know what they’re talking about, and I think I’ve got quite a good radar for people of substance.” Then, in terms of knowledge or ignorance, does she consider the likes of Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis sufficiently conscious of the potential threat to the union posed by Brexit? “We’re more attuned to it in Scotland because we’ve lived it so long. I argued at the time to David Cameron that one of the lessons from Scotland was you can’t have a referendum campaign where statements of free unicorns get knocked down within six months. What we learned in Scotland was that it takes months to dismantle arguments. “And because it was such a short [EU referendum] campaign, we never had the discussion about Northern Ireland. There a whole part of the UK about which the debate happened after the result was known, not before. That is a great sadness.” Ruth Davidson praised after talking openly about mental health issues Of course, for Davidson to acknowledge something is a potential threat to the union also involved her potentially acknowledging that the SNP might have a case for independence after Brexit, and so, inevitably, she offers a bright side: “Brexit has absolutely knocked on the head the idea that you can have big constitutional change and it will be seamless. So in terms of dismissing legitimate concerns as ‘project fear’, which is what we saw prior to I think it will be much harder to do.” Is she angry with the Brexiters at what they have done to her party? She sighs theatrically – “How to answer this without getting myself into trouble?” – then explains in the most roundabout way she can muster how she respects the Eurosceptic view but profoundly disagrees with it. She adds, with an indirect swipe at Johnson: “I did have a particular issue sitting in a political cabinet one day where somebody who may have written two articles [for the Telegraph], one backing Brexit and one backing remain, decided to stand on his honour about why he should be the voice of the conscience of the room, when actually the rest of us had come to it from a place of genuine belief. I remember feeling angry that day.” Davidson loyalty to May is absolute and not untested, given the specific difficulties arising in a country where the majority voted to remain, that remains heavily dependent on migrant labour and is run by an SNP government ready to seize on every stumble to bolster the case for independence. May resilience is “astonishing”, she says; Salzberg was “a falling-out that had to happen to clear the air”; Chequers “will be the basis around which there will be a negotiated deal and I do believe there will be a deal. “I know that right now there are UK and Irish officials sitting down trying to work out some of the impasse on the Irish problem, which will then go to the EU,” she says, adding that she believes there is “a willingness to be more flexible than we’ve seen in public”. Given Davidson current exalted status, it is easy to forget that she was considered a wildcard when she was narrowly elected leader in months after being first elected to Holyrood. Through one prism, Davidson is the very model of a modern Tory, and yet she boasts a thoroughly traditional Conservative background: a committed Christian who served as a signaller in the Territorial Army and cares deeply for the values of family and home, speaking the language of self-reliance and social mobility that has always appealed to a section of blue-collar Scottish voters. But it is a credit to Davidson – and perhaps a shared credit to Scotland, a country where, as she points out, homosexuality was only decriminalised within her lifetime and years after it was in England and Wales – that she has made this all so unremarkable. It has become quite normal to see Davidson, who will be the first serving UK party leader to give birth, around Holyrood with her burgeoning bump. She says she discussed talking publicly about her diagnosis with the Scottish mental health charity SAMH several years ago, “but my big fear has always been that it distorted”. She explains: “If I left this job and had never talked about it, I feel like I would have let myself down. I would have hidden a little bit. I don’t know if it because I spent a number of years in the closet before I came out, but I just know it would have helped me to have had someone talk about this, and years ago people didn’t.” I am struck by this reference to her sexuality, and remind her of her previous reticence in discussing that, too. “I had to learn how to be gay in public,” she agrees, “I didn’t know how to do it and I didn’t have anyone to learn from.” Ruth Davidson is right. Who’d want to be Britain prime minister? | Dawn Foster In she told the Guardian about the responsibility she felt around being the first openly lesbian political leader at Holyrood, and likewise now the thread of public service runs through her replies about mental health. “If I’d had someone say [when I was ill]: ‘Look, it not a full stop, all of those dreams that you have for yourself, you can still do them.’ And also this idea that it binary: you have a mental health issue or you don’t, or you had one and now it fixed. It not like that. It about ongoing management, and you do a chaotic job that doesn’t have regular hours, that has periods of incredibly high pressure, and it is doable.” Could another explanation for her good cheer – Davidson laughs a lot – be the serendipitous exit from the political stage she is about to make, avoiding worsening Brexit dramas, to return in the spring with clean hands? “I did have it in my head that I’d quite like to be off for the World Cup … But realistically, the timing of this wasn’t really in my hands. I’ve been leader for seven years, I’ve fought six elections and two referenda in that time. I’ve got a period when there isn’t an election for a couple of years: I’m years old and I’ve a family history of early menopause. There wasn’t really another time.” Yes She Can: Why Women Own the Future by Ruth Davidson is out now, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",1984,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/28/ruth-davidson-were-not-as-far-along-in-the-conversation-about-mental-health-as-we-think
32,"The Conservatives risk becoming “a rump party of nostalgic nationalists”, senior ministers have said after Labour announced a package of interventionist policies aimed at middle England. Some ministers said they feared the party annual conference in Birmingham this week could be defined by infighting over Brexit, with little else to say to the country. “We’ve been told it about ‘getting through’ conference,” one senior source said. However, there is no consensus among senior Tories about how the party should counter Labour offering. The business minister, Sam Gyimah, said the Conservatives had to emphasise their belief in the alternative to Corbyn policies by being more vocally pro-business, while a select committee chair, Robert Halfon, said the Tories must set out their own social justice agenda. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is thought to be unlikely to approve any significant further spending, though ministers such as the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, are tipped to make announcements. Theresa May speech is set to focus on immigration. Labour announced a slew of policies at its conference in Liverpool aimed at broadening the party appeal. They included shares for workers, regenerating the high street and spending on childcare, housing and green jobs. After Corbyn speech, the party released a political broadcast targeted at leave-voting towns, highlighting social issues such as insecure work and failing transport systems and featuring seats Labour would need to win in order to secure a majority in a general election, including Mansfield and Hastings. The film, made by the award-winning director Simon Baker, said the party was listening to left-behind voters who had been “sold short” by the political and economic system. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, said the Tories had underestimated how slick Labour campaigning had become. Even the rightwing press agree: Corbyn is winning the battle of ideas | Polly Toynbee Asked by a Tory student at the Reform Scotland thinktank whether she had seen the Labour broadcast, Truss described it as “very good” and “a serious threat” to the party. “That video does capture the heart of where we need to be as a party,” she said. “So we need to be talking about how people lives are getting better.” Gyimah said May must restate the party mission and purpose. “We can’t out-Corbyn Corbyn, and if we try we risk offering a pale imitation that leaves people yearning for the real thing,” he wrote in an article for the House magazine. The business minister said he expected a full-throated endorsement of capitalism and enterprise or the party would look like a limp version of the opposition. “When I look at how we on the centre-right have reacted to the perceived failing of capitalism, I can’t help thinking we have lost our way,” he wrote. Gyimah said the party was “confused about how to handle business” saying it swung between “Trumpian economic nationalism” and reaching for “the old playbook, implying that if we simply deregulate and cut taxes, all will be fine,” a coded warning to some Conservative colleagues over the party Brexit strategy. “Whichever side you are on in the Brexit debate, we need to realise that if we are not the party of business then we are nothing,” he said. “So we need to find our way, and quickly.” Halfon, a former deputy chair of the party, said the Labour conference had offered “serious stuff … that may resonate with millions of workers”. Writing for ConservativeHome, Halfon said Corbyn diagnosis of the problems with homelessness, failing railways, poor services from utilities and failing high streets resonated with huge swathes of the public. “They are speaking to the problems faced by many. We too often speak only for the few,” Halfon said . “I am not urging more socialism on our country, far from it. I just want a conservatism that answers these things. “I just hope that next week Tory conference sets in train conservatism for the future – a vision that deals as much with social capital as economic capital, and gets to grip with the burning injustices that the prime minister pledged to tackle when first on the steps of Downing Street.” George Freeman, the former chair of the prime minister policy board, said: “This is a moment: when the underlying rules of our system of political economy profoundly change. “A new generation of aspirational professional voters under are rejecting the old model. Unless the Conservative party reconnects with them, we risk becoming a rump party of nostalgic nationalists,” he told the House magazine . Freeman, the founder of the group of Conservative MPs who publish ideas for the party future, said the party could not rely on “breathless government announcements … as out-of-date as New Labour spin and husky-hugging”. Before the conference, May announced a fund to overhaul transport links between suburbs and city centres, a policy that could appeal to small-town voters disgruntled by creaking infrastructure and the amount of money spent on transport in the capital. Local authorities, including Derby and Nottingham, Leicester City, Norwich, Plymouth, Stoke-on-Trent and West Yorkshire, will bid for a share of the funding, which could include new bus routes or docking stations for electric bikes. May said the proposals would “help spread growth beyond London and empower local businesses to create more, better-paying jobs”.

33,"What the Tories’ story? Jeremy Corbyn conference speech – and a well-received political broadcast released as delegates made their way home – presented a coherent narrative about what gone wrong in Britain, and how Labour would seek to fix it. Since Theresa May “ burning injustices ” speech when she first arrived in Downing Street, the Conservatives have struggled to offer an equivalent – not least because Brexit is so all-consuming, and it is hard to hit refresh when your party has been in government for eight years. The prime minister does occasionally tell a good story – as when she announced of extra spending for the NHS in June, drawing on her own experiences as a patient, and praising “the model of healthcare that reflects our values as a people”. But Conservative MPs anxious that their party is drifting sideways are keen to hear the pitch the prime minister will make – and a few consumer-friendly policy offerings wouldn’t go amiss either. Who in charge of Brexit? May advisers were hoping for warm words at the Salzburg summit last week, rather than the diplomatic equivalent of a slap in the face. But her brutal trolling at the hands of Macron and Tusk may not have been as unhelpful as it must have felt at the time. Grassroots Conservative members, even those who might be sceptical about the details of Chequers, are likely to circle the wagons around the prime minister after her tough post-Salzburg statement, urging leaders to treat her with “respect”. One senior Conservative said: “I actually think she’ll be cheered to the rafters – it after conference that the trouble really starts.” 'May totally betrayed us': Tory grassroots' Brexit tension boils over But away from the main conference stage in Birmingham, evidence of party disunity on the crucial political decision facing Britain won’t be hard to find. Boris Johnson speech at a lunchtime fringe meeting on Tuesday will be the hot ticket; while Jacob Rees-Mogg is hosting his own event, covering “what Conservative MPs are doing in parliament to ensure the referendum result is respected”, and “why a super Canada deal is better than Chequers”. After Amber Rudd became the latest high-profile Conservative MP to moot the idea of a second referendum on Wednesday, the voices of those who would like to see a closer relationship than Chequers would allow – or even to cancel Brexit altogether – are also likely to be prominent. Who next after May? Several members of Theresa May cabinet already give the appearance of treating just about every public outing as an audition for the top job; but in Birmingham they will get a chance to make their pitch directly to the party members who will ultimately decide who will succeed the prime minister. Among the rising stars in the cabinet whose speeches will be closely watched onstage and at fringe meetings are Michael Gove, who has urged colleagues to back the Chequers plan on the advice that it could be changed under a different prime minister once Brexit is secure (hint, hint), and Sajid Javid, whose Home Office brief will be the key plank of the prime minister speech on immigration . Jeremy Hunt, the new foreign secretary, who has spent his first months in post demonstrating how differently he approaches the role to his predecessor, will also be closely watched. Johnson will speak at one fringe meeting only, expected to be packed to the rafters, but his presence will be keenly felt, especially after his opus attacking the Chequers plan in the Telegraph just hours before the conference. Defending capitalism Labour bumper offer to voters including shares for workers and nationalising water, rail and mail, as well as attractive spending offers on childcare and green jobs, have some Tories worried they are losing the opposing argument. Many are likely to make the case that the Tories need their own social justice agenda, but other colleagues will say the party must make the arguments anew for capitalism, free markets and entrepreneurialism. Even the rightwing press agree: Corbyn is winning the battle of ideas | Polly Toynbee At the head of the pack is Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who has said the party can attract younger voters by emphasising personal freedom and innovation, including championing tech companies like Uber and Airbnb. Business minister Sam Gyimah has called for the party to give its full-throated support to business at the conference, to draw a clear line between the Tories and Labour. “When we Conservatives veer between talking business down, ignoring voters’ concerns, and telling businesses to shut up – or worse – it is a clear sign we have lost our way,” he said, a coded criticism of Johnson, who is reported to have said “ fuck business ” in response to concerns about Brexit. A personal re-boot for the PM The last party conference could not have gone worse for the prime minister. Just months after a punishing election where the party lost a lead and its parliamentary majority, May conference speech was interrupted by a protester who proffered a then a coughing fit where the chancellor had to intervene to offer her a throat sweet. Finally, letters from the party slogan began falling off the wall behind her. The past year has not been easy, with the resignations of cabinet ministers including allies such as Amber Rudd as well as critics like David Davis and Boris Johnson, and votes lost in the House of Commons. Most recently has been the disastrous summit in Salzburg when EU leaders rounded on her Chequers plan. Yet there are signs the prime minister can still rescue her premiership from total disaster. Crunch votes in the Commons have been fraught but won for the most part and she won praise after a punchy response to the Salzburg rebuff. Facing mutiny from the membership and from her own MPs this autumn, May will want to use her speech to reaffirm who is in charge, for now, and put to bed any other Brexit option that her rivals are pushing.

34,"The Conservatives face a “catastrophic split” if Theresa May relies on Labour votes to push her Chequers plan through parliament, one of the prime minister most persistent critics has warned, as the conflict within the party over Brexit intensified. After a weekend dominated by coverage of Boris Johnson views on the UK withdrawal from the EU , and his tangled personal life, the former junior Brexit minister Steve Baker used an interview to mark days before departure to argue May must take a different approach. Baker, who quit in July over Chequers, said at least Conservative MPs would be willing to vote against the plan, which Eurosceptics argue ties the UK too closely to the EU on regulation and alignment, hampering future bilateral trade deals. The issue is expected to dominate the Conservatives’ annual conference at the end of the month, with MPs from the hard-Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG), which Baker formerly chaired, hoping to sink the Chequers proposal. “If we come out of conference with her hoping to get Chequers through on the back of Labour votes, I think the EU negotiators would probably understand that if that were done, the Tory party would suffer the catastrophic split which thus far we have managed to avoid,” Baker told the Press Association. “We are reaching the point now where it is extremely difficult to see how we can rescue the Conservative party from a catastrophic split if the Chequers proposals are carried forward. “It is absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to me to acknowledge that, but I look at the mood of colleagues and the mood of the Conservative party in the country and I am gravely concerned for the future of our party.” While it is widely acknowledged that Johnson, who also wants May to abandon the Chequers plans, is seeking to position himself as the next prime minister, Baker said he was not advocating a change in leadership. “Time is running awfully short for anyone who thinks a leadership contest and a general election is a good idea,” the Wycombe MP said. The justice secretary, David Gauke, disputed Baker assessment. Asked by Sky News if Baker view was accurate, he said: “No, I don’t think it is.” Gauke castigated Baker and fellow Eurosceptics for not having a coherent plan of their own: “This is a process that is going to require compromises from all sides. And I think it is really important that we go forward with the Chequers proposal. Frankly, there isn’t an alternative that has been put on the table by the critics of Chequers. We haven’t had an alternative set out.” Gauke was similarly critical of Johnson after a furore over an article by the former foreign secretary on Sunday, in which he argued May Brexit plans amounted to “a suicide vest around the British constitution”. “I don’t think his comments yesterday were well judged,” Gauke said. “And, returning to the substance, I don’t think he set out an alternative approach to Brexit , in contrast to the Chequers plan. This is a time where we have to seriously address the issues in front of us, have a serious plan to deal with the situation. The prime minister is a serious politician who has set out serious plans.” Asked later by BBC Radio Today programme as to whether he could serve under Johnson, Gauke said there was no vacancy, adding: “I’m probably not a natural Boris supporter.” The former education secretary Nicky Morgan likened the “suicide vest” comment to a previous Johnson article in which he likened Muslim women wearing the niqab to “letterboxes”. Both were “deliberately incendiary language which just masks the ability to debate the issues”, she said. Morgan added: “Boris has to make a decision – I think he sort of made it. He either a journalist or a he a politician. He knew exactly what he was doing when he was using that language.” Baker and his ERG allies are seeking a so-called Canada-plus deal, which would be based around free trade, but with notably more limited alignment to EU rules. The ERG has been drawing up its alternative Brexit plan based on this. A draft leaked over the weekend showed it also called for significant tax cuts, something strongly argued for by Johnson in his weekly column for the Daily Telegraph on Monday. Baker said the ERG had decided to hold back on publication of its detailed plan in order to focus on a plan to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit, which he said was the “key to the gate” to a satisfactory agreement. Another ERG member, the Tory MP Simon Clarke, told Today he believed this was possible, adding: “The Northern Irish border issue is one that has been greatly exaggerated and abused. I think, for Irish domestic political reasons and by the EU itself. I think there are good reasons to believe that if you want to solve the problem then you can.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",867,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/10/brexit-tory-conservative-mps-chequers-deal-theresa-may
35,"n a Friday night at a Conservative club in a slightly run down part of Hornchurch in east London, local party members gathered for a pint, a round of darts and to chat about the week gone by. Around a table in the corner, under the watchful eye of portraits of the Queen and Winston Churchill, the local constituency chair, Bob Perry, sat with several of his members. Brexit: May humiliated by Salzburg ambush as she fights to save Chequers As they sipped their drinks, the conversation turned to Brexit . Earlier in the day, Theresa May had issued a message of defiance from No having been humiliated by the EU rejecting her Chequers plan at the end of the Salzburg summit . The activists were dismayed. “They’ve treated both her and us appallingly,” said Perry. “She been tough today but I don’t think she gone far enough. But my respect for the prime minister has grown after today. A lot of people say she doesn’t have a backbone, but I think she shown them wrong. She has my sympathy.” Sandy Scott, a retired accountant, added: “This is going to be a terrible year for her. She trying as hard as she can, but the way she was treated was despicable.” There was a general murmur of agreement from around the table. Even though the Tory party grassroots were furious about May Chequers plans, the EU appears to have overplayed its hand. The prime minister decision to metaphorically wrap herself up in the union flag with her message of defiance in the wake of Salzburg has achieved its aim, boosting her street cred with the Tory grassroots. “We just want to get through party conference,” said one Whitehall aide. “We had been hoping for warm words at Salzburg to tide her over, but we didn’t get them. So we had to pursue a different strategy.” Downing Street has been starkly aware of the danger posed by bringing together thousands of febrile MPs and party activists at a time when May Brexit strategy was still hanging in the balance. “It going to be difficult,” acknowledged one senior No adviser. “The PM knows the country, let alone the party, is very polarised and that she needs to get on the front foot to address that.” Uniting the UK after Brexit was expected to be at the heart of her conference speech. If this country had a chance ... it could look after itself. In the second world war we were feeding ourselves Sandy Scott Back in Hornchurch, which sits in the Brexit-supporting heartlands where London merges into Essex, it is clear that while the membership sympathy could get May through conference, she still faces fierce opposition over her Brexit plans longer term. Perry described her proposals as unworkable. Scott added: “She trying her best to get a deal but personally I’d rather have no deal than a bad deal … If this country had a chance and an opportunity it could look after itself. In the second world war we were feeding ourselves.” Elsewhere in the Tory party the atmosphere has been more hostile. In a wood-panelled private dining room at a members club in central London last week, the executive committee of the group Grassroots Conservatives met to discuss the government approach to Brexit. Afterwards, the group chair Ed Costelloe, a former constituency chair from Frome in Somerset, set out his concerns. “The government and the prime minister have utterly failed to explain how we can do international trade deals while also following EU rules and how will that work,” he said. “If you’re selling something, it doesn’t matter whether it a washing machine or a treaty, you’ve actually got to say this is how it works. We haven’t had any of that. I cannot understand what kind of politics it is that says ‘this is a great deal, I’m the PM, I say so’, and there it stops.” Steve Bell on May sticking to her universally disliked Brexit plan – cartoon A poll last week by the Tory grassroots website ConservativeHome found that, post-Salzburg, just one in party members thought May should stick with her plan – down from a quarter before the EU rebuff. The Tory party has, over the last few months, been trying to win over constituency chairs on Chequers. May chief-of-staff, Gavin Barwell, has had groups into No Costelloe described one of the meetings: “It was probably to who said ‘I don’t like this’. The atmosphere in the room was absolutely dreadful. They simply weren’t buying it.” Grassroots, a campaign group not officially affiliated to the party, has been deluged by hundreds of emails and letters from activists worried that the prime minister was going to compromise still further with Brussels. “Most people cannot conceive a situation where Theresa May can give any more concessions without totally losing face in the party and the country,” said Costelloe. “Unhappy would be far too mild a word. The membership would be absolutely incandescent.” Delyth Miles, another committee member and former constituency chair from Wales, added: “She has categorically stated that she won’t move her boundaries this time. I want to believe her very much but the outcomes she selling to us just don’t make any sense to me and not to thousands of our supporters either. “In all my years as an activist and building up the profile of the Conservatives and the membership, I’ve never experienced such anger and sense of betrayal from people. She totally betrayed us.” Hostility towards May runs deep. Costelloe, who has chaired two different constituency associations and speaks regularly to local chairs across the country, believes it has its origins back in when she offended thousands of members by describing them as “the nasty party”. The options available to the membership, currently thought to be around strong, were limited. Their only real power, beyond lobbying local MPs and threatening to withdraw financial and campaigning support, was the final say on who becomes their next leader. Costelloe said: “We’re not making a big stir because of this business of loyalty to the prime minister. We’re not campaigning to change the leadership. The question to ask is would the next general election campaign be led by Theresa May? That the key question because I think she has lost the trust of the average Conservative voter.” CCHQ and a certain caucus in the upper echelons of the party hold the local associations more or less in total contempt Ed Costelloe May departure has been widely regarded as a matter of when, rather than if, and activists have openly discussed who might succeed her. Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson names come up the most frequently. In Hornchurch, Rees-Mogg will be the star guest at next month constituency dinner. Tickets sold out immediately. Others believed the party needed a fresh face, although they conceded May could hang on. Grant MacMaster, a student who has just joined the Hornchurch Tory association, said: “I’m moving towards somebody who isn’t particularly outspoken about Brexit because after Brexit I think there needs to be domestic consensus.” There has been deep frustration at local level at the party perceived lack of interest in the grassroots. “They don’t want to know. Talk to any Conservative association. Many will feel that CCHQ and a certain caucus in the upper echelons of the party hold the local associations more or less in total contempt,” said Costelloe. But they have a warning for the government. “They rely on us for financial support and our time but they need to remember we are also expressing the views of Conservative supporters in terms of voters. At the moment there real bitterness and frustration out there in the country,” said Miles. While they may feel dejected that the MPs harbour most of the power in the party, rumours of deselection of remainers to assert their authority seem wide of the mark. “There is a mechanism, but why would we want it?” asked Perry. “The possibility exists but it would be extremely rare,” Costelloe said. Thanks to Brexit, the British voice counts for less at the UN Tory MPs warned of the threat of entryism over the summer after the former Tory donor and Ukip backer Arron Banks urged thousands of Leave.EU supporters to “flood” the Tory party to elect a “true Brexiteer”, such as Johnson or Rees-Mogg. But the threat did not come to pass. “We have a new computerised membership system which would enable us to recognise a spike, and we haven’t seen one,” said one senior CCHQ official. “Banks is good at publicity but rubbish at logistics. I could be a teenager having a party at my parents’ house with people and say there were loads of people. It all relative.” In Hornchurch, over another round of drinks, the group, which also includes Perry wife Carol and MacMaster mother Karen, agreed that despite the prime minister desire to strike a deal, they would prefer to crash out rather than accept Chequers. “We’d all love a deal but the deal has to be on our terms, not the EU terms,” said Perry. “I know he Ukip but Nigel Farage made a very valid point when he called them gangsters. These people are just bully boys.” The fragile truce in the wake of Salzburg could come to a brutal end.

36,"John Major awarded himself “a full gloat” after seeing off challenges by William Rees-Mogg and parliamentary Eurosceptic rebels over the Maastricht treaty, confidential files from Downing Street reveal. Gruelling political battles over the future of the EU are recorded along with the fact that before Black Wednesday, when the pound dropped out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, the Treasury sold about of foreign currencies in an attempt to defend sterling – some of it obtained through a secret deal. Major attempts to ratify the Maastricht treaty, which created the constitutional basis for the union, involved protracted negotiations and internecine Conservative party feuding that lasted more than a year. He eventually faced down his critics by tabling a confidence motion in November The events of years ago demonstrate close parallels to Brexit, not least because the prime minister then was fiercely opposed by Lord Rees-Mogg, father of the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who initiated legal action against the government in the hope of preventing the UK from signing the treaty. The Maastricht bill finally passed through the Commons on July and the courts dismissed Rees-Mogg judicial review challenge a week later. No memos released to the National Archives in Kew on Tuesday show an embattled Major finally savouring his triumph. A note from his private secretary, Rod Lyne, headed “Maastricht court action”, said: “Our lawyers are pleased with the judgment in the Rees-Mogg case. All three judges supported us on all three issues … The outcome was even better than our lawyers had expected.” On the letter, Major wrote: “Good. A full gloat is merited.” Lyne also advised that: “The foreign secretary [Douglas Hurd] is exercising restraint in public comment … He does not wish to provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade into further quixotic action if there is a chance that they will now abandon their expensive and ultimately pointless [legal] action.” Major parliamentary victory was celebrated by a host of foreign and EU commission leaders who sent private messages of congratulations. The Canadian prime minister, Kim Campbell, said he had demonstrated “unflinching leadership”. Albert Reynolds, the Irish taoiseach, was the first to signal his approval. His fax was blurred in transmission and read by the official initially as: “Now keep your head down and ? drink up”. A cleaner version arrived later, showing Reynolds’ message to be: “Now keep your head down and drive on.” Major thanked him, replying: “You won’t know quite how good it feels finally to be through all the hoops, hurdles and heffalump traps of our obstacle course. It feels very good.” In response to the Greek prime minister, Constantin Mitsotakis, Major wrote: “The outcome reflects the fundamental importance which Britain attaches to the community and to the work which we shall continue to do as a very active and committed member state.” Rees-Mogg legal challenge had been resented by the prime minister office as a further complication but Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, wondered at one stage whether it made the tactics for the parliamentary vote easier since he could “go flat out to defeat the Labour amendment [on the social chapter]”. He added: “There is a delicious irony in seeing Lord Rees-Mogg riding to the government rescue.” During the passage of the bill, Major advisers made approaches to minority parties trying to win over their votes in support of the Maastricht bill. Against the DUP, one official wrote: “Really so hopeless? Nothing they’d be interested in?” Major was sceptical that discussions with the Liberal Democrat leader, Paddy Ashdown, would produce anything. When the foreign secretary met him, no deal emerged. “The temptation to say ‘I told you so’,” Major noted on the memo. After the Maastricht parliamentary vote, Major notoriously referred to Eurosceptic rebels in his cabinet as “bastards ”, as the Tory civil war over Europe refused to die down. Files from the previous year show that emergency intervention in the exchange markets before sterling dropped out of the ERM on Black Wednesday, September was estimated by the Treasury in November that year to have involved sales of around of foreign currency reserves. In Treasury documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the cost of the Black Wednesday debacle of may have been only rather than the previously estimated. That lower figure was based on a Treasury analysis.

37,"Furious ministers rounded on Boris Johnson for suggesting the UK could renege on its Brexit agreements over the Irish border, calling it unworkable and criticising the former foreign secretary for denouncing agreements made while he was a cabinet minister. The Department for Exiting the European Union issued a defiant statement rejecting Johnson alternative, laid out in a Telegraph article, saying it was “not a workable or negotiable plan,” less that two days before the start of the Conservative party conference in Birmingham. Government sources mocked Johnson disavowal of the December withdrawal agreement, when he had been part of the cabinet that approved it, dismissing his intervention as “another very lengthy article which doesn’t offer any answers”. UK nationals would suffer under skills-based immigration, EU tells Javid Speaking ahead of the conference, May said the government was on the verge of a Brexit deal, despite admitting after the EU summit in Salzburg that the two sides remained some distance apart on customs and the Northern Irish border. “The right deal is close – and with it the opportunity to make life better for ordinary working people,” she said. But Johnson continued his public intervention with a series of television interviews – his first since quitting over Chequers – criticising the prime minister, warning May that she risked betraying the wishes of leave voters if she persisted with the Chequers deal but stopping short of calling her to go. Johnson told the BBC: “If you stick with Chequers, the electorate of this country will look at what we have produced and think how on Earth was that the outcome of voting leave.” He was then asked if he would challenge for the leadership if he failed to persuade May to change course. “My job is to speak up for what I believe in and the vision that I’ve set out today and I believe in it very, very sincerely. I’m going to keep going for as long as it takes,” he said. Johnson told Sky News he stood by what he had said in his previous columns when he compared fully veiled Muslim women to “letter boxes” and “bank robbers” and said that people should read his articles in full. In his article on Friday, Johnson said May should renege on the December agreement, which included the Irish “backstop”, keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market in order to avoid a hard border. Johnson said the UK should instead pursue a “super Canada trade deal” aiming for zero tariffs and quotas, with investment in new technology to ease customs at the border. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Brexit minister, hit back at Johnson on Friday evening, saying: “This is not a workable or negotiable plan for Brexit – as both sides have made clear on several occasions. No deal is available without a guarantee that there would be no hard border in Northern Ireland in any eventuality, the so-called Irish backstop.” A government source also dismissed Johnson criticism of the December agreement. “Boris was a member of the cabinet that agreed the December joint report – and praised the PM for doing so – and was part of the committee that agreed the customs backstop,” the source said. Johnson is set to attend a rally on the night before May conference speech, an appearance likely to dominate any preview of her address. But the prime minister is understood to be determined that cabinet ministers put on a disciplined united front at the conference, which begins this weekend with a string of policy announcements planned. May said the conference theme was “opportunity” and that the party would set out a vision for a post-Brexit Britain, after a fractious few days where senior Tories have publicly cast doubt on the party message after Labour focused on on childcare, high street renewal and housing at its conference. “We’re now at a crucial moment,” May said. “So at this conference, we will be setting out how we will provide opportunity for all – a stronger, fairer country with real opportunity for people who work hard and do the right thing. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, considered to be a future leadership contender, intends to give teachers, police officers and other officials a new legal duty to take a “public health” approach to violent crime, supported by a “youth endowment fund” targeted at crime hotspots. Downing Street also announced May would back a bid to host the Fifa World Cup in the four nations of the UK and Ireland, saying the joint bid would be a “strong contender”. May said the decision was spurred by the “excitement of this summer World Cup” when England reached the semi-finals in Russia. “The decision on whether to bid is, of course, for the football associations to make. But if they decide to go forward, they can count on this government full support,” she said. Any bid would face opposition from a joint campaign by Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, which has already launched a bid with their “believe big” slogan.

38,"Derek Hatton, the leftwing former deputy leader of Liverpool council, claims to have rejoined the Labour party. Labour said he was not a member of the party. However, it is understood the party has found no reason to deny an application from Hatton, who claimed in the Liverpool Echo that he had been readmitted years after being kicked out by the then leader, Neil Kinnock. Could Corbyn solve Brexit and save Britain? I can almost imagine it now | Martin Kettle Hatton was expelled for belonging to the leftwing Militant Tendency. He caused a national outcry in the by setting an illegal council budget and was denounced at the Labour conference for using taxis to send redundancy notices to thousands of council workers.

Hatton said he was inspired by Jeremy Corbyn leadership to reapply for membership. The writing in the Liverpool Echo, said he spent much of the last years at odds with the Labour leadership, particular over Tony Blair decision to invade Iraq. However, he said, he had remained committed to the party throughout the period and that the recent Labour conference had prompted him to rejoin. He wrote: “In all my time I have never witnessed such passion, such energy and such powerful socialist leadership. And strangely that power is despite a kinder, gentler form of politics. Many people, myself included, probably never thought we would witness an unswerving socialist like Jeremy Corbyn at the helm. “He stands there with a set of policies clearly aimed at benefiting the vast majority of people in this country and a strategy which will not be dictated to, or influenced by, the five billionaires who own of the country media.” He added: “Now I’m a ‘Labour party member’ I believe nothing should take our eye off the ball of securing a Labour government under Corbyn.” The Liverpool Echo reported that despite returning to the party, Hatton ha d no plans to run for public office .

39,"I am no fan of Jeremy Corbyn . He has been an ineffective leader of the opposition in parliament, failing to take advantage of a hopelessly inept PM and many political open goals. However, I am fed up with the grudging critique of many of your commentators. Martin Kettle asserts that “Labour has now been radically transformed into a party in the leader own far-left political image” ( Can Labour solve the Brexit question? Now it imaginable , September). What Corbyn Labour is proposing would have been seen as mainstream social democracy in the and a refashioning of a mixed economy of public and private ownership which is still in existence in parts of Europe. I am a green social democrat who felt disenfranchised during the New Labour years. Thatcher and her successors moved political hegemony well to the right and indeed, I would contend, that the Tories in particular, have ruined our country with their rightwing extremism. Labour programme is indeed quite modest. I would prefer it to be properly radical, such as promising to abolish private education as the Finns did! Philip Wood Kidlington, Oxfordshire It is amazing the lengths and depths Jeremy Corbyn critics will go to in order to smear him. A quotation from Ernest Jones sends them racing to the internet to dig up the dirt on this obscure figure and imply that Corbyn is guilty by association ( An unlikely muse: The ballad of Ernest Jones , September). Perhaps Corbyn should have instead quoted from Churchill (drunkard), Byron (philanderer) or Coleridge (drug addict), all of whom feature prominently in the dictionary of quotations sitting on my shelf. Professor Trevor Curnow Lancaster It was depressingly predictable that an Institute of Directors spokesperson opinions on the wisdom of taking utilities back into public ownership should be offered space ( Row of the day , September), rather than exploring its support for indefensibly high executive pay, and excessive unwarranted dividends to shareholders. But the IoD, along with the CBI, inhabits a world where Britain is allegedly prosperous and people like John McDonnell are considered dangerous. The centre ground continues to shift so that the shadow chancellor seems to have the support of the established church and a respected former industry minister and joint architect of the “northern powerhouse”. That quite a challenge for a Tory party whose relationship with business, already strained, recently suffered a desperate Johnson-inflicted insult. Les Bright Exeter, Devon Polly Toynbee may see John McDonnell as thinking modern thoughts, but I’m sure he has a strong sense of history ( Labour fate depends on its own Thomas Cromwell , September). Take the “novel and unfamiliar” plans for John Lewis-style share ownership and employees entitled to a third of seats on boards. In the Liberal party voted for compulsory profit-sharing and co-partnership. These things take time to rise to the top of the agenda! Geoff Reid Bradford Jeremy Corbyn speech had three crucial and interlinked components: the need to transform the economy, to prioritise improving conditions in the “left-behind” areas, and a call for a “green jobs revolution in every nation and region”. But your editorial September) made the common mistake of emphasising wind and tidal schemes to help disadvantaged areas. Important as these green energy sources are, the real potential for jobs in every constituency lies in making the UK existing dwellings and commercial and public-sector buildings energy-efficient, with renewable technology such as solar PV fitted where feasible. There are, for example, homes with solid walls which are without any effective insulation, and nearly smart meters still need to be installed. The majority of this work has to be done locally and has the advantage of being hard to automate or relocate abroad; it also requires a wide range of activities and skills that are likely to be needed for decades. It will therefore inevitably help improve job opportunities for the “left-behind” communities, with resultant knock-on economic benefits for the communities where these workers live and work. Owen Jones ( Labour needed a reset button – and it got one , September) asserted that Jeremy Corbyn crucial identification of climate change as the greatest crisis facing humanity made it a bread-and-butter issue. Equally the role of a green revolution in jobs in improving the lives of those in leave-voting areas could well make it a bread and Brexit issue as well. Colin Hines Convenor, UK Green New Deal Group How are any of the various reforms proposed by Labour to be paid for without more taxes? According to most people whose views I have read or heard, it is only the “very rich”, or at most anyone whose income is greater than that of the writer or speaker, who should pay more. But anyone who belongs to any association, who needs it, wants to profit from it, and be a real and responsible member of it, with a voice in its affairs, must surely want to contribute to it according to its needs and their means. As a comfortably off single woman income after tax – I think – I ought to pay more tax – and actually want to. I am too old and infirm to take holidays away from home, let alone foreign holidays. But how many people who think their taxes too high, or high enough, have had at least one foreign holiday in and also spent money on other breaks away from home, and maybe had work done on their house or bought new furniture just to keep up with the trend? Would a slightly larger payment of tax to our central government – and maybe even more urgently to local government in this now excessively centralised state – really impoverish them? What about more income tax and council tax bands?

40,"t around midday on Tuesday, Conservative party members attending their conference in Birmingham will face a dilemma that says a lot about the terribly divided state their party is in. In the main hall, home secretary Sajid Javid , seen by many as a contender for the leadership when Theresa May departs, will be limbering up for his keynote speech. It will, no doubt, be portrayed in the media as Javid pitch to the grassroots for the top job. But not far away, outside Hall of the International Convention Centre, the queues will have been forming for hours for another lunchtime event, one that will perhaps have even greater significance for the future direction of the Tory party. “I would get there early,” says Paul Goodman, a former Tory MP and now editor of ConservativeHome, which is hosting a speech by Boris Johnson due to begin at “I think Sajid Javid address will be very important,” adds Goodman. “But people are saying that the two biggest events of conference will be the Boris Johnson speech, and the prime minister on Wednesday. And I would go along with that.” Last week, Labour divisions over Europe and Brexit were on full display in Liverpool. But, worryingly for the Tories and encouragingly for Labour, Jeremy Corbyn party managed them pretty well and emerged looking, on the surface at least, like a force united around a radical programme for government. Tory cabinet ministers now admit they are deeply worried because Labour seemed so hungry for office and so united in its determination to fight an election soon – and win. By contrast, they are all too aware that their own party has spent the past two years doing little but obsess about Brexit. They know they lack a counter-offer anything like as well formed as Labour. In a pre-conference interview with the Observer , the health secretary, Matt Hancock , recognises today that his party must get its act together soon or the result, for them, will be catastrophic. He says it is “mission critical” that Tories, starting this week, “win the argument for a well-run market economy” and defeat Corbyn “scary” leftwing agenda, which “could really sink Britain”. The challenge for Theresa May , therefore, will be more than just containing the vicious party war on Brexit, and the leadership speculation that feeds off it. She also needs her cabinet to stay together sufficiently to spell out a coherent domestic programme that can convince people her government is about more than delivering – and rowing about – Brexit. It looks a daunting task. On Europe , most of her party members and MPs believe her Chequers plan is dead . As one senior Tory MP put it: “I have no idea how she convinces people she is the one to steer us to dry Brexit land when almost everyone rejects her route map.” As if she will need reminding of the extent of her problem, on the fringe Johnson , David Davis, Jacob Rees-Mogg and other darlings of the hard Brexit right will be rubbishing Chequers all week. There does, however, seem to be a twofold conference plan to keep the May show on the road. First, cabinet ministers have all been ordered to come to Birmingham armed with eye-catching policy ideas to ensure delegates and the media spend some of the time, at least, on ideas, and policies. Today, the health secretary, in this paper, announces plans for the first ever national guidance on social media use by children because he is worried about the effects of excessive use on their mental health. The prime minister today reveals plans to bring in higher stamp duty for foreign buying of UK property. Housing will be a central theme of conference, whose slogan is “Opportunity for All”. Second, there is a big Rubbish-Boris-and-stand-by-Chequers-if-we-possibly-can operation, led by No Yesterday, Alan Duncan, Johnson former deputy at the Foreign Office, dismissed his boss of a few weeks ago as a “spent force”, “not intellectually focused”, and of “untidy mind”. Hancock and the rest of the cabinet, meanwhile, are insisting Chequers is the best Brexit plan because it is the only credible one anyone has come up with. In reality, though, few at the top of the party have much faith that it will go smoothly. As Johnson prowls the fringe, Brexit moderates in the cabinet, appalled by the idea of him ever leading the party, privately worry that the EU rejection of May Chequers plan in Salzburg earlier this month, and the prime minister riposte from Downing Street, in which she ruled out possible compromises with the European side, have put her in an increasingly impossible position. Opinion polls, including today by Opinium for the Observer , suggest she may have got a bounce from her “no surrender” message. But cabinet moderates fear she is boxing herself into the no-compromise line. May speech on Wednesday presents her with difficult choices. Does she play the patriotic card again and please the crowd by vowing “No Surrender!”, taking on Johnson at his own game? It would be the easy way out in the short term and would appeal to the grassroots. But with a critical EU summit just a fortnight away, moderates caution that it may not be so wise to bash the Europeans too hard if she wants a good deal for the country. As one former cabinet minister put it, the whole process is “on a hair trigger”. One false move and the Brexit talks could collapse, and with them May premiership. The Observer has spoken to Tory MPs on both sides of the EU debate who think she should go the other way and back a soft, Norway-style Brexit in the short term – handing a new leader the time and space to construct looser trade deals that could work for the long term. “For most of the public, they want everyone to stop talking about Brexit – and those who voted Leave just want to know we’ve left,” said a former minister. As she headed to Birmingham yesterday, May was being pulled in all directions by her own party just at the time when unity was more important than ever.",1035,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/30/embattled-may-struggles-keep-show-on-road

42,"The key sentence in your leader ( Vince Cable has a plan to motivate moderates, but not a clear enough purpose , September) is: “To protest against New Labour governments from a liberal-left position, only to then join forces with the Conservatives, was too violent a lurch for many of the party natural supporters.” One could rehearse again the extreme danger of every option available to the Liberal Democrats after the indecisive election, but the simple fact is that survival for the party in any coalition requires a proportional representation system at the following election, and&nbsp;Nick Clegg failed to deliver this. You also refer to Vince Cable “movement for moderates”, but this is another chimera. I have been a member of the Liberal party, then the Liberal Democrats , for over years, and never have my Liberal colleagues and I conceived of ourselves as “moderates”. No Liberal is moderate about poverty, civil liberties or a united Europe. The&nbsp;party certainly was not moderate in opposing the Iraq invasion. The political gap today is very different. It is for a confident progressive, radical&nbsp;and internationalist party that also espouses public service, devolution and pluralism – which&nbsp;is exactly where the Liberal&nbsp;Democrats&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;be. Michael Meadowcroft Liberal MP, Leeds West, The Guardian critique of Vince Cable was justified, but it might have spared him the omission of his knighthood in the five references to him as “Mr Cable”. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords It is good to see that Jo Swinson, deputy leader of the Lib Dems, has recognised her party role in enabling the penalising of the poor during the coalition government ( Lib Dems must ‘own the failures’ of coalition, says deputy leader , However, her pride in having pushed to “raise the personal allowance, and take the lowest paid out of income tax completely” seems misplaced. The Equality Trust comments that “as analysis after analysis has shown, increasing the personal tax allowance does not help families on the lowest incomes at all and helps those on higher incomes more than those in the bottom half”. It&nbsp;reported that, in the regressive personal allowance increase to would give a year to households in the bottom and more than times as much to households in the top – and nothing to those whose income fell below If the Lib Dems want to raise the incomes of the poorest, rather than giving more to the already well-off, a much more efficient measure is, as the Equality Trust suggests, to reduce the rate of withdrawal of universal credit (assuming it can be made to work efficiently) or to increase how much people can earn before benefits start to be withdrawn, both costing less and increasing incentives to work. Elizabeth York Northampton Nick Clegg demand that the Lib&nbsp;Dems should stop apologising for the coalition ( Clegg: stop saying sorry for coalition , September) may not be his response to my recent letter ( Centre-ground politics too often misdefined , August), but his continuing justification of the coalition falsehoods about the cause of the recession, the state of the economy in and the assault on the wellbeing of the poor, which started under the government of which he was a senior member, is astonishing. They did not stop the Tories introducing more divisive measures and, had they stood aside, it would have been possible to turn the Cameron government out when its bungling became serious – say, at the time of the “ omnishambles ”. Clearly, if the Lib Dems wish to restore the support they once enjoyed, they should not only apologise for the coalition, but also for Mr Clegg; he is an albatross around their necks and the quicker they realise that, the better the fortunes of the party will be. Les Summers Kidlington, Oxfordshire Nick Clegg wants the Lib Dems to stop saying sorry. The problem is that the impact of university tuition fees will last for a long while. Clegg is a bit like the Black Death – he has a legacy. Terry Ward Wickford, Essex If Nick Clegg hoped that the Lib Dems would emerge from the coalition “as some kind of stabilising agent in&nbsp;British politics” ( Liberalism has to be rebuilt. Just not by the Lib&nbsp;Dems , Journal, September), he needed to strike a much better deal with David Cameron than a referendum on an alternative voting system. This lost referendum lost us the chance of electoral reform that many voters hoped for when they elected a hung parliament in In place of reform he swallowed George Osborne false argument for austerity cuts, resulting in the destruction of local government in our most disadvantaged towns. Consequent rising levels of poverty and homelessness fuelled the leave&nbsp;vote.

43,"Business groups and professional organisations have reacted with alarm after the migration advisory committee, an independent expert body that advises government, said that lower-skilled workers should not get work permits to come to the UK after Brexit and that higher-skilled workers from the EU should not get preferential treatment compared to higher-skilled workers form outside the EU. This is probably what many people who voted leave in wanted, but the prospect of having to manage under the MAC rules, without free movement, has worried employers reliant on blue-collar workers (eg, the haulage industry - see and those reliant on professionals (eg, architects - see . Big business (the CBI - see and small businesses (the FSB - see are equally unhappy. In some respects the MAC recommendations are academic because it acknowledges that the government may want to negotiate preferential access for EU workers as part of the Brexit deal. (It does not formally recommend this, but it implies it would be sensible, saying preferential access would be “something of value to offer”.) But it has also been strongly criticised by Yvette Cooper , the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, for not setting out the costs and benefits of such an offer. (See Alan Travis , the Guardian former home affairs editor, sums it up like this. The committee has quashed claims that EU migration has had a significant, negative impact on wages, services and house prices. It explores the impact of EU migration in considerable detail and overall its verdict is that the impact has been more modest than supporters or opponents claim. It acknowledges some advantages and some disadvantages, and summarises them in a chart here. Opposition to EU immigration was one of the factors that led to the UK voting leave in But Prof Alan Manning, the committee chair, said that the fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote almost certainly did more to make people poor than EU immigration did. (See Police chiefs have said a no-deal Brexit would mean the loss of an array of crime-fighting tools and that any planned replacements would be less effective. BMW plans to shut its Mini plant for a month after the UK official departure from the European Union, to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts. Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, has walked into a row over his demand that the EU compromises in the Brexit talks, as the European council president, Donald Tusk, warned that the “catastrophe” of a no-deal scenario was “still quite possible”. Tusk has confirmed that an emergency EU summit is being planned for November to finalise a Brexit deal. (See Vince Cable has urged Liberal Democrat activists to lead a “crusade” to liberate Britain from the “Brexit nightmare”, by making common cause with moderates from other parties. John McDonnell said he wanted a woman to become the next leader of the Labour party, a day after senior party figures were accused of failing to take allegations of sexual harassment seriously enough. Polling conducted in constituencies and on Eurosceptic issues of “potential strategic significance” to Ukip did not breach UK donation rules, an investigation has found. That all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at BST What MAC says about impact of EU migration on wages Here is an extract from the MAC report summarising what it says about the impact of EU migration on wages. It has lowered wages for the poorest (those in low percentiles), but increased them at the top. The overall effect, though, is slight, says the report (pdf). These extracts are from pages and The new updated results [of research conducted for the MAC] show the same pattern of effects across the UK-born wage distribution as in the original study, with negative impacts at the bottom of the distribution and positive impacts at the top. In terms of magnitude, the estimates for all immigrants are similar to those from the original paper. These suggest that for a percentage point increase in the EU-born working age population ratio there is an associated per cent decrease in UK-born wages at the and percentiles, a per cent fall at the percentile and a per cent increase at the percentile. Given the percentage point increase in the EU-born working age population ratio between and the implied total effect on UK-born wages of EU immigration is of the order of a per cent reduction to the and percentiles, a per cent reduction to the percentile and a per cent increase at the percentile. As previously stated this type exercise should be interpreted with caution as the model only estimates the short-run response to migration. Economic theory, and evidence, suggests that any short-run impact is likely to dissipate overtime. Again, it is useful to place these estimates in context. Over this whole period, hourly real wages for UK-born workers increased by per cent and per cent at the and percentile respectively, per cent at the percentile and per cent at the percentile. These estimates therefore suggest that EU immigration had a relatively small impact on overall wage growth ... Taken altogether the existing evidence and the analysis we presented here suggests that immigration is not a major determinant of the wage growth experienced by existing residents. There is some suggestion that the impact on lower skilled groups may be more negative than for higher-skilled groups, but again these estimates are imprecise and subject to uncertainty. And here is some more reaction to the MAC report from various political and professional bodies. From Luke Cooper, convenor of Another Europe Is Possible , which campaigned for a remain vote in and for progressive reform of the EU This report is a strange and contradictory. It confirms that EEA migration is good for Britain. But then proposes to scrap the system of free movement which has underpinned this success. The great advantage of free movement is that it is a system of rights and responsibilities. Moving to a system of work permits where migrants have less rights could have significant unintended consequences. Canada in particular should not be held up as a model given its temporary foreign workers’ programme has been repeatedly criticised by migrant rights campaigners and trade unions as mandating exploitative labour market practices. From the former Labour MP Gisela Stuart , chair of the pro-Brexit Change Britain The UK post-Brexit immigration policy should attract talent from across the world, therefore it absolutely right for the report to reject a preferential system for EU migrants ... The government must act on the recommendations of this report to restore democratic trust in our border policy and create the immigration system our economy needs. From Donna Kinnair, acting general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing This report puts paid to the damaging misbelief that migrant workers are a drain on health and care services. The independent experts found that the reliance of the NHS and social care on overseas professionals far outweighs the cost of their care. However, when we know that the training of healthcare staff in EU countries is very similar to our own, the call for there to be no preferential treatment for EU staff to work in the UK after Brexit represents a missed opportunity. Only last week, vacant jobs in the NHS in England hit a record high. With no long term strategy to alleviate shortages, the future UK immigration system must be equipped to recruit and keep the brightest and best professionals – patient safety depends on it. The Committee call to remove the limit on highly skilled workers from other countries is welcome. The UK has long depended on nursing professionals from around the world and any future cap on their numbers would leave health and social care services unable to recruit the nurses they need. From Louise Wren, policy manager for the health charity Wellcome The research workforce is highly mobile and connected, and the success of science depends on this. Today recommendations could have a severely detrimental impact on the research community. Even with the potential changes to the tier visa system proposed by the migration advisory committee, the system isn’t quick or agile and is costly. From Alan Vallance, chief executive of the Royal Institute of British Architects The recommendations in today report would have profound implications for architecture. One in five architects working in the UK are from the EU and after freedom of movement ends, it is crucial to create a post-Brexit immigration system that helps protect the workforce and addresses long-standing problems. It is disappointing that the committee has recommended introducing a immigration skills charge to employ EU nationals and that it has not moved on the onerous salary threshold. Both of these measures will hit smaller practices the hardest. The SNP has restated its call for the Scottish parliament to take control of immigration policy for Scotland. It has put out this statement from Stuart McDonald MP about the MAC reports. It is vital that immigration powers are now devolved to the Scottish Parliament to ensure we can build a system that meets Scotland specific needs and values. The UK government ‘Little Britain’ hostile approach to immigration is damaging Scotland economy and public services - by deterring the talent we need to attract to live, work and study here. Westminster has proven itself to be utterly incapable of standing up for Scotland needs and interests on immigration – and all the signs suggest that the Tories’ right-wing post-Brexit vision for immigration will cause even more self-inflicted harm, at the worst possible time for the country. I plan to wrap up the blog at about Comments will close at around MAC proposals concerning for small business says FSB The Federation of Small Businesses says the migration advisory committee recommendations are “deeply concerning” for the small business community. This is from its chairman, Mike Cherry. The MAC report is deeply concerning for the small business community. per cent of small businesses in the UK employ someone from the EU and yet they will be the ones hit the hardest by the huge added costs and administrative burdens of the proposals outlined in the MAC report. Our research shows that ninety-five per cent of small employers had never made use of the UK points-based immigration system to meet their business’ labour and skills needs. This is because of the costs and complexity of the system. Simply expanding the tier general route to include EEA citizens will hurt small businesses, the wider economy and productivity. The damage will be worse for those businesses that work in sectors like hospitality, retail and care that are already facing chronic skills shortages. Small businesses will be pleased to see the suggestion that focus should be given to mid-skilled workers, but disappointed not to see a concerted action plan around them. While access to high-skilled labour is vital to the UK small businesses, even more important to them are those who are mid-skilled - such as mechanics, care workers, office administrators. Talking about the informal EU summit in Salzburg starting tomorrow, Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, told the Irish parliament today: I do not anticipate there will be any change to the EU position or any change to our negotiating guidelines. Most of the comment on the Vince Cable speech from journalists that I’ve seen on Twitter has focused on his “erotic spasm” verbal slip. (See Here are some of the more general comments. From the Daily Mirror Kevin Maguire From the BBC Norman Smith From the Mirror Jason Beattie From the Times’ Patrick Kidd Here is the text of the Vince Cable speech. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart story about Sir Vince Cable’ s speech. Vince Cable calls on Lib Dems to liberate Britain from 'Brexit nightmare' And here is how it starts. Vince Cable has urged Liberal Democrat activists to lead a “crusade” to liberate Britain from the “Brexit nightmare”, by making common cause with moderates from other parties. The Lib Dem leader was giving the closing address to his party annual conference in Brighton, where he sketched out reforms aimed at tempting a wave of new supporters to sign up for what he has called a “march of the moderates”. He insisted the Lib Dems would be “leading the resistance to the forces of illiberalism. Leading a crusade to give the people the final say on our future in Europe , and looking outwards to a changing world, with confidence and determination that our values will outlast and outclass the forces ranged against them.” of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Liberal Democrats Migration Immigration and asylum Donald Tusk European Union",2124,/politics/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/18/brexit-mac-migration-eu-confirms-emergency-summit-planned-for-november-to-finalise-brexit-deal-politics-live
44,"here an art to announcing the time of one departure. Make it too late and it will look to everyone as if you’ve been pushed. Make it too immediate and it will look as if you are desperately clinging on to power. Vince Cable has seemingly achieved the impossible by doing both at the same time. Vince Cable calls on Lib Dems to liberate Britain from 'Brexit nightmare' For a while now there has been a widespread feeling among Liberal Democrat activists that Cable has to go. As a leader he been more black hole than rallying cry. An absence rather than a presence. But last week, when he sought to reassure his party that he wasn’t going to be around for too long he only made things worse by saying he would stay until Brexit was either resolved or stopped. That could be years. Years in which most Lib Dems would rather Cable took a back seat. There also an art to announcing one arrival. Cable is not immune to vanity and self delusion, but even he can see the writing on the wall. There was a time when he could have been the party poster boy – the man who could tell it like it was – but now he is yesterday man. Nick Clegg has commanded far more interest than the Lib Dem leader at this year conference, while some of the party faithful have openly lamented the loss of Tim Farron charisma. Things really are that bad. So both Cable and his audience were anticipating his closing speech with some trepidation. Something to be endured rather than enjoyed. But Cable had wanted to make an instant impression on everyone. A soundbite that would make the news headlines. To his credit, he managed it. Just not in the way he intended. He had imagined himself bouncing on to the stage, his eyes smouldering as he made intimate contact with those in the front rows and got the whole hall eating out of his hands as he made a risque gag about the Tory party being locked in an “erotic spasm” over Brexit. Come again, Vince! Ooh, yes please! He’d worked on the line, time and again the night before in his hotel room. And each time he absolutely nailed it. Hell, he was king of the Lib Dem sex scene. Only the year before he had written Open Arms, a far from best-selling thriller about a whole bunch of people who were secret Lib Dems, in which emotional and physical dams constantly burst within the main characters. Nobody did it better than Cable. Who the Daddy? Except when the words “erotic spasm” appeared on the autocue, he just couldn’t bring himself to say them. What came out was an entirely different, involuntary, emission. “Exotic spresm,” he garbled, somehow managing the almost impossible feat of sounding both more and less embarrassing than he had originally intended. The audience didn’t know whether to laugh or try to pretend that it had never happened. Lib Dems feel they're finally being heard on Brexit. Even if they're not | John Crace The exotic spresm rather did for the rest of the speech. Which was a problem as there were still minutes to go. He went through his well-scripted routine of slagging off Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, but the spark just wasn’t there. Just the odd smatterings of polite applause as he ploughed on in a dull monotone. Seldom had a call to action to stop Brexit been made to sound so depressing. Or futile. We’re here because we’re here because we’re here: the new mantra of Cable Lib Dems. What he wanted was a march of the moderates. The moderates quite fancied a march too. They just didn’t want one with Cable leading from the front. That much was clear. Almost half the conference hall had been curtained off to make it look as if it were more full than it actually was, and the few security guards present were there more to make sure nobody left than to prevent anyone getting out of hand. Chance would be a fine thing. The march of the moderates slowed to a near plod. Most leaders’ speeches aim to end on a high. Cable just petered out. With not even one final exotic spresm to send everyone home with a smile on their face.

He insisted the Lib Dems would be “leading the resistance to the forces of illiberalism. Leading a crusade to give the people the final say on our future in Europe , and looking outwards to a changing world, with confidence and determination that our values will outlast and outclass the forces ranged against them.” Liberalism needs to be rebuilt – just not by the Lib Dems | Rafael Behr In a strongly worded attack on both major parties, Cable said Labour and the Tories had been captured by the extremes – and the Lib Dems must “extend the hand of friendship” to disillusioned members from both. “Let them in. And if they are too shy to come in, let us extend the hand of friendship and co-operate with them,” he said. He added: “The two big parties have changed from broad churches into intolerant cults. And those who question the faith are unwelcome.” With the prime minister battling to secure a deal with Brussels, which she will then have to bring back to parliament for approval, Cable hopes the Lib Dems can profit from the deep divisions rocking Labour and the Conservatives. “The Labour leadership is dominated by people who believe in doctrines far removed from the sensible social democratic tradition which prevailed from the days of Clement Attlee to Gordon Brown.” “They in turn are the mirror image of the Tory zealots who have more in common with Ukip than their party one nation traditions,” he said. Cable added that Brexit “fundamentalists” were prepared to risk the economic future of the poorest people in the UK in return for leaving the EU in an “erotic spasm” – a phrase that he garbled in his delivery. “For the true believers – the fundamentalists – the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant,” he will say. “Economic pain felt, of course, not by them [but] by those least able to afford it.” He compared the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson to the US president, Donald Trump, calling the pair “the terrible twins of the rabid right”. As the negotiations in Brussels reach their endgame, and with a growing number of MPs in both parties publicly backing another Brexit referendum, Cable said: “Much now depends on the courage of mainstream MPs in the Labour and Conservative parties. They are losing control and if they can’t stop the rot, they should leave.” He also sought to capitalise on Labour internal woes, saying party members should “wave goodbye” to Jeremy Corbyn if he fails to shift his position and endorse the idea of a “people vote”. Labour will gather in Liverpool next weekend, with its members set to discuss the issue of a people vote on the conference floor, after it was forced on to the agenda by trade unions and local parties. The Lib Dems performed strongly in May local elections, gaining three councils, including in Cable backyard in south-west London. But there has been widespread speculation about Cable future in recent weeks, with aides conceding that if the parliament runs to its full five years, so that the next general election would be in the now year old would not fight it as leader. He sidestepped the question of his personal future in the speech, instead setting out a series of policies he said would equip Britain for a future beyond Brexit. In particular, party members voted on Tuesday to back radical tax reforms that would abolish inheritance tax, instead taxing the recipients of large bequests – or lifetime gifts – at their own marginal tax rate, above a lifetime allowance. Capital gains tax would also be levied at the same rate as income tax under the proposals. The Lib Dems say the package would raise about in total – one-third of which would be set aside to create a sovereign wealth fund. At last year general election, the Lib Dems failed to make gains on the scale then-leader Tim Farron had hoped for, with the party anti-Brexit message overshadowed by his personal beliefs. He stepped aside shortly afterwards, giving way to Cable, who was business secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition of Senior party figures clashed in Brighton this week over whether they should celebrate or deplore the decisions they supported while in government. Cable deputy, Jo Swinson, said the Lib Dems needed to “own the failures” of that period; while the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg insisted he remained proud of the party role. “There is this narrative hung round the Lib Dem party neck, which is just false, that we sold our soul, merrily went along with a savage, ideological approach to austerity which deliberately penalised the poor. It is simply not true,” Clegg said.

46,"The most senior civil servant in Northern Ireland has said a no deal Brexit could make trade impossible for some firms in Northern Ireland. As the Press Association reports, David Sterling, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, told an event in Brussels that many local firms could be very badly affected in these circumstances. He said: I cannot stray into political territory. However you will not be surprised to hear that we have deep concerns about the risk that no deal is agreed and there is chaotic exit from the EU. Under such a scenario, costs for our businesses could significantly increase or create what might just [make it] impossible for many firms, particularly in our agri-food supply chains, to trade normally in this era of ‘just in time’ processing and manufacturing. In the life cycle of many goods they have to cross the land border many times. Our research has shown that two-thirds of cross-border trade involves supply chain activity. How would this work if they had to make customs and VAT declarations each time? John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has urged Philip Hammond, the chancellor, to rule out a no deal Brexit. Speaking after the publication of today IMF report on the state of the economy, McDonnell said: Today the IMF has underlined the warnings that we’ve already heard from trade unions and business organisations about the damage that a cliff edge Brexit would do to our economy. Once again I call on the chancellor to show some leadership and make it clear to his colleagues that he will not accept a no deal Brexit and the damage it risks doing to jobs, wages and living standards in this country. Bex Bailey, the Labour activist who revealed she was raped at a party event in has criticised party leaders for refusing to publish a report that accuses them of having “accommodated” sexual harassment, the Independent reports. Bailey spoke out in an interview on the BBC PM programme broadcast just now. Nick Clegg has said the Liberal Democrats should stop apologising for their time in coalition with the Conservatives, in a sideswipe at the call from the future leadership favourite, Jo Swinson, for the party to “own the failures”. That all from me for today. Comments will close at Chequers: the video - A review Here are some stills from Chequers - the video. Frankly, one feels for the poor soul in the Downing Street communications team tasked with the job of turning the government Brexit white paper (the document that sets out the Chequers plan) into a snazzy Facebook video suitable for social media sharing. In the circumstances he or she has done a pretty good job - except for the fact that, at minutes and seconds, it about minutes too long. And it doesn’t have any cats. They should have got Larry involved. But perhaps he wasn’t interested. Still, here are some of the more interesting images from the production. This one accompanies a passage where Theresa May (who provides the voice over) explains that, even though Chequers marks a compromise (or a “significant shift”, as she puts it, in the UK position), some red lines remain. This one gives an indication as to the quality of the drawing involved. (On second thoughts, perhaps Larry was involved - he couldn’t have done much worse.) And this one is worth noting because it shows how “taking back control of our own laws” (supposed to be one of the main benefits of Brexit) has now become (in May words) ending some EU legislation becoming law in the UK without parliament ever considering it. That because, under Chequers, the UK would remain bound by the EU rulebook for goods and would be expected to pass its own laws mirroring any new EU legislation in this area. (Parliament could, of course, refuse, but that would have trade or financial consequences.) Updated at BST No releases Facebook video to help sell Chequers plan Downing Street has unveiled - Chequers, the video. Updated at BST Jaguar Land Rover has announced that more than staff will move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands, only hours after the carmaker was accused of “scaremongering” about the impact of Brexit by a Conservative MP, my colleague Rob Davies reports. More than Jaguar Land Rover staff will go to three-day week Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, has been in Madrid today for a meeting with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez. In a tweet he says there can be a Brexit deal provided the integrity of the single market is maintained - a condition that the EU has imposed from day one. Clegg says he be a British Macron Nick Clegg told a fringe meeting at the Lib Dem conference that he could not be a British Macron. The former Lib Dem deputy prime minister said: I’d love to think some sort of British Macron would come charging over the horizon and save us all from Brexit . But the secret to these breakthrough characters is precisely that they arrive relatively unencumbered by baggage. Clegg said his own role in the coalition meant that he could not perform this role. I can’t pretend that you can suddenly shed all that baggage and have a completely fresh start. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel. New characters will emerge to lead that political renewal. I plan to wrap up the blog at around And we plan to close the comments at some point between around and Osborne says Home Office was to plight of child refugees when May was in charge In today Evening Standard, George Osborne , the editor and former Conservative chancellor, says that when Theresa May was home secretary, the Home Office was “unsympathetic” to the plight of child refugees. Osborne makes the point in an “editor reply” column to a letter from the Labour peer Alf Dubs praising Sajid Javid, the current home secretary, for his recent decision to allow children from the Calais refugee camp now living in the UK a new right to remain. Osborne wrote: Sajid Javid has, as you say, done a “good thing” for those children who have arrived since We should not underestimate the symbolism of this step by the home secretary. I know from my own experience of raising these issues in the cabinet how unsympathetic the Home Office was when it came to asking for help. Dismantling the “hostile environment” that was created during those years is going to take time. By the standard of some of Osborne previous jibes at May (she sacked him when she became PM, of course), this is relatively mild, but it does undermine May attempts to depict herself (see PMQs last week) as a champion of of social justice. Lunchtime summary Theresa May has insisted that the only alternative to her Chequers plan is crashing out of the European Union with no deal, prompting her critics on the right of the Tory party to say she risks a “car crash” if she sticks to her policy. She was speaking in an interview with the BBC Nick Robinson for a Panorama programme being broadcast tonight. See for a full summary and analysis. Downing Street has mocked Boris Johnson for using his Telegraph column today to condemn an EU Irish backstop proposal that he endorsed when he was a member of the cabinet. Johnson has now put the full text of his column on his Facebook page. Anti-Brexit campaigners have claimed that, even if everyone who voted in the EU referendum were to vote the same way again, demographic changes mean that the UK population will have a remain majority by March when the UK leaves . Peter Kellner , the former YouGov president, has done the analysis for the People Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on the final Brexit deal. His analysis involves looking at how the people voted in and then calculating how population changes - the death of mostly older voters, based on average death rates, and the fact that people who were too young to vote two years ago are now over - will have altered the mix. It assumes people would vote as they did in and does not take into account evidence showing there has, separately, been a slight shift to remain. There is a very strong correlation between being older and voting leave, and previously Kellner calculated that the crossover point - the moment when remain would outnumber leave, assuming everyone still alive voted as they did two years ago - would come in November next year. But in the light of new polling showing that the “new voters” (people who are or now) are even more pro-remain than assumed has led him to conclude the the crossover point will come on January next year. Kellner said: YouGov latest figures tell us how those who were not yet last time would vote now. Those who say they are certain to vote divide seven-to-one for remain. This matters statistically: for it helps to explain why demographic factors alone will cause the UK this winter to switch from a leave country to a remain country. Because this cross-over point occurs before March – when the UK is due to leave the EU – it means the British public view of Brexit will have changed even without anyone who voted two years changing their mind. Young people who were not eligible to vote in and can do so now make it much harder for anyone to claim that Brexit is still the ‘will of the people’. Older voters are just as keen on leaving the EU as they were two years ago, younger voters are moving even more strongly into the remain camp – and the very youngest voters back continued membership of the EU by a remarkable margin. It is very rare for a significant demographic group to support one side so overwhelmingly on an issue that splits the nation down the middle. What is more, young voters are the ones who will still be dealing with the long-term consequences of the current Brexit drama in ten or years’ time, long after many leave voters have gone. Today young voters are making clear that they want a pro-European inheritance – and are ready to stand up and be counted, in a fresh public vote. The UK economy would rapidly start to contract in the event of a disruptive exit from the EU next spring, according to a stark International Monetary Fund report that highlights the recession risks of a no-deal Brexit. Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative Brexiter, has accused the head of Jaguar Land Rover of inventing dire consequences for his company of a no-deal Brexit, saying people no longer believed the “scaremongers” in the debate. A proposal to move the statue of the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst from near the Houses of Parliament to the private Regent University London in Regent Park has been withdrawn after widespread anger. Prospective parents should be banned from using a blood test to determine the sex of their baby in the early stages of pregnancy, Labour has said. In response to Theresa May suggestion that MPs will face a binary choice between her Chequers plan and a no deal Brexit , Ukip says they should opt for no deal. This is from the Ukip leader Gerard Batten. After a summer of dripping Project Fear into the public ears, Mrs May has put down an in or out option. Ukip has always said that no deal, which is really reverting to WTO terms, is better than a bad deal with the EU. Mrs May deal, whatever the particulars, will not be what the British people voted for on June it will be Brexit in name only.

47,"Nick Clegg has said the Liberal Democrats should stop apologising for their time in coalition with the Conservatives, in a sideswipe at the call from the future leadership favourite, Jo Swinson, for the party to “ own the failures ”. Speaking at the Lib Dems’ annual conference in Brighton, the former deputy prime minister said: “One of the golden rules of politics is don’t say stuff that reinforces your opponent. “We went into coalition eight years ago, there is something quite Lib Dem about still thinking about the things we did or didn’t feel comfortable with when we entered into government so long ago.” Clegg said he did not believe mea culpas to be election-winning strategies. “In the end, you have to give a clear message; are you basically proud of who you are, or not?” he said. Lib Dems feel they're finally being heard on Brexit. Even if they're not | John Crace “There is this narrative hung round the Lib Dem party neck, which is just false, that we sold our soul, merrily went along with a savage, ideological approach to austerity which deliberately penalised the poor. It is simply not true.” Swinson, the party deputy leader , who was a business minister in the coalition, cited the bedroom tax and hostile immigration environment as regrettable policies. “When they fought dirty, we were too nice,” she said. The main draw on the conference floor on Monday was the anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller , tipped as a potential future leader of the party if changes allowing non-MPs to stand are voted through. However, the businesswoman, who led the legal fight for a parliamentary vote on article said she would not stand for leader or join the party. “Today I speak to you as a friend and someone who feels a bond with you on many issues, but may I say straight away, particularly for the benefit of the journalists here in this hall who have been doing a great deal of speculating lately, I am not addressing you as your leader-in-waiting,” she said. “Truth be told, I am not a member of your party, or indeed any party now, but I want, all the same, to see the Liberal Democrats thrive, because in a healthy democracy we need a strong third party, every bit as much as we need a strong opposition, and, for that matter, a strong government and a strong prime minister.” Speaking to journalists afterwards, Miller expressed irritation that she is often portrayed as wanting to “stop Brexit”. She said: “I wish you would all stop saying this, you know, it really not helpful: stop saying ‘stop Brexit’.” Miller also expressed doubts about the phrase “people vote” as a slogan for those campaigning, as she is, for the public to be given a say on the final Brexit deal. “I don’t like the phrase,” she said. “It not definite enough. It doesn’t have enough detail behind it.” On the conference floor in Brighton, Lib Dems backed a move to unilaterally revoke article if the prime minister cannot secure an exit deal by March, to avoid a no-deal scenario . Party members also supported an activist amendment by which the UK could opt to stay in the EU without a second referendum or general election, though with some tacit backing from the leadership. The policy seeks to extend the article period in an attempt to secure another referendum. However, the policy states that if no deal has been reached and no referendum is in sight, the UK should “withdraw the article notification” if the EU will not allow an extension.

48,"ou have to hand it to the Liberal Democrats , they know how to make their party conferences a little different. If only by giving them the feeling of a slightly autumnal, past its best, end-of-the-pier show. Take the merchandise stalls at this year event in Brighton. A hi-vis vest with a Lib Dem logo for the hound in your life? Mmm. Maybe not. An card with an orange Lib Dem motif? Just what every teenager wants. Or three different Tim Farron fridge magnets? I’m not sure there a market even for one. For several years now, the Lib Dem conference has been less a celebration of the party triumphs than a soft howl of pain . A polite raging against the dying of the light. A plea for relevance at a time when Lib Dems feel like an endangered species. Not even the truest believers ever tried to talk up winning MPs at the general election last year as a massive gain. It was a party whose sole remaining purpose was seemingly to stay one step ahead of oblivion. Even the occasional defiant messages of optimism from the conference stage had the hollow sound of despair. Stop apologising for coalition, Nick Clegg tells Lib Dems This year, though, there was a slight change of mood. Where previously the Lib Dems could only collectively hold their heads in their hands as they warned of the catastrophe Brexit would bring, they now feel as if their voices are being heard . Even if they probably aren’t. If the chances of a “people vote” have increased dramatically over the past six months, it almost certainly has everything to do with the hopelessness of the government EU negotiating strategy rather than the public finally hearing the Lib Dem message. No matter. A win is a win and, whether by accident or design, the Lib Dems feel they are just about back in the game. So the Lib Dems did what only they could. They invited Gina Miller to give the keynote speech to Monday conference. How better to make it clear to everyone in the party that none of its MPs had the charisma to hold a crowd or say anything about Europe that would be worth listening to for minutes? The snappers duly picked up their cues. Having mysteriously remained silent while Tom Brake and Wera Hobhouse spoke in the earlier debate, the cameras flashed into action when Miller took her seat minutes before she was due to speak. It had been thought that Vince Cable might have invited Miller as an overture to getting the Lib Dems to accept someone who wasn’t an MP as leader. But Miller was quick to scotch that rumour. She wasn’t a leader-in-waiting, she declared at the beginning of her speech. She wasn’t even a Lib Dem. Heaven forbid. The Lib Dems were far too niche and she planned to reach a far bigger audience. She liked the Lib Dems and agreed with many of their aims on Brexit. Though rather in the manner she might treat a pet. Perhaps the hi-vis dog jacket might have a taker after all. “I’m not political,” Miller explained, somewhat disingenuously. It would be interesting to know what her definition of political was. Miller was the woman who defeated the government in the high court and the supreme court over parliament right to have a vote in triggering article and was most recently seen posing near the edge of the white cliffs of Dover as she launched her End the Chaos website to help steer the country to a second referendum. Still, she a busy woman, so maybe these are just hobbies she indulges in during her spare time. Her speech was functional, but nothing more. Miller covered enough of the main bases – including several plugs for her website – to keep the conference hall happy, but she never really sparkled. She lacked any real passion. Maybe she was nervous, but this felt more like the Queen Christmas message. A semi-detached pep talk to her people, rather than a whole-hearted call to arms. It will take more than this to convince many Brexiters. But it was enough to earn her a standing ovation. Stardust is thin on the ground in Brighton this week and the delegates are grateful for what they can get. As she left, the hall immediately began to clear, with several people falling upstairs behind her. The chairperson announced conference would reconvene at It was now A two-and-a-half hour lunch break. Presumably because there really wasn’t much more business to discuss.

49,"The Liberal Democrats must “own the failures” of the coalition government, the party deputy leader, Jo Swinson, has said, citing the “hostile environment” , the bedroom tax and NHS changes as policies she particularly regreted. Swinson, a former business minister tipped as a future leader, said the party had inflicted too high a price on the poorest in society in an attempt to cut the deficit. “I’m proud of what we achieved, but I’m not naive or blinkered about it,” she told the Lib Dem conference in Brighton on Sunday. “If we are to claim the successes of our time in government, we need to own the failures of it too. We lost too many arguments. When they fought dirty, we were too nice.” Cable rejects Lib Dem coalition with ‘appalling’ main parties The MP, who regained her East Dunbartonshire seat in June last year after losing it in said she was particularly proud of some of the coalition achievements, adding that she had fought the Tories “in budget after budget to raise the personal allowance, and take the lowest paid out of income tax completely”. However, she said it was clear the Lib Dems should have done more to push back against some coalition policies. “Negotiating with the Conservatives meant compromise. And some of those compromises sucked,” she said. “We should have done more. More to stop Theresa May hostile environment, more to block Andrew Lansley disruptive NHS reforms, more to prevent Iain Duncan Smith punishing bedroom tax. We were right to cut the deficit, but those who were already struggling paid too high a price.” Swinson comments caused some discomfort among her colleagues. Speaking to reporters after her speech, the party home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey , a cabinet minister during the coalition, bristled at some of the criticism. “I’m not one of those who think we should deny all the amazing things we did in the coalition,” he said. “One of the reasons I’m loving the Brighton conference is those offshore wind turbines out there. I signed the contract for that. Because Liberal Democrats were in government, those offshore wind turbines have been built. “Do you think I’m gonna deny that? I’m deeply proud of that. You’ve got to remember in coalition we were fighting some of their immigration policies, we stopped a lot, we weren’t going to stop everything.” Earlier, Swinson, seen as a possible replacement for the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, who has said he will not fight a general election, said she was relaxed about the party proposed changes to allow non-MPs to stand for leader , a move that could see her edged out of any forthcoming race. “You don’t need to set up a new party because the Liberal Democrats are here, but we recognise that we have to change in order to make it easier for people that perhaps haven’t looked at us before to look again at the Lib Dems,” she told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Asked if she would consider running for the party leadership, she said: “There no vacancy at the moment … at the time that Vince does stand down, then absolutely I’ll take a view at that point.” Earlier in the day, the party conference voted on a new immigration policy paper rejecting the hostile environment. Davey said the Lib Dems would scrap the net migration target and end indefinite detention , as well as changing the border force. Lib Dem members also voted through amendments to give migrant spouses an entitlement to benefits from their first day in the UK, despite opposition from party chiefs and warnings from some activists that the Lib Dems would be “slaughtered” on the doorstep over the issue.

1,"or two days Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were as inseparable as Holmes and Watson (Sherlock and the doctor, not JB and Bubba), but it was the quiet Italian who struck out boldly on his own in the ninth singles match on Sunday to create Ryder Cup history in his dignified and irresistible manner. His dismantling of Phil Mickelson was his fifth win of the edition of the competition, after four with Fleetwood in the four-balls and foursomes. It drew him alongside the Americans Arnold Palmer and Gardner Dickinson and Larry Nelson by completing a sweep of all his matches – and that in the summer when he won the Open at Carnoustie. All that could surpass this high point, surely, would be for Molinari – born in Turin and for years a bona fide Londoner – to repeat the double in when the Ryder Cup goes to Italy for the first time, at the Marco Simone Golf Club in Rome. At the Albatros Course on a blue‑sky Sunday afternoon, he went two up after four and never looked back, playing with as much searing concentration as he did alongside Tiger Woods on their Sunday dash to the line at the Open two months ago. He also accompanied Mickelson on the closing when the American shot to win at Muirfield in He was no spectator this time. A lot of water has spread over this lake-spattered course outside Versailles since then, and a lot of players have seen their shots go under. The only time Molinari got wet was under the spray of the celebration champagne his teammates dumped on his head at the end. As a West Ham supporter he cannot have been that familiar with the sensation, although he was buoyed by their win against Manchester United the previous day. His own steady hand did not deliver the dagger, though, but came via the quivering mandibles of Mickelson, who drowned his ball off the tee on the par-three It might have been the last shot of the American record appearances in the competition. For Molinari, being part of a third Ryder Cup-winning team was “so much more than majors, more than anything”. He added: “It hard not to get emotional when you think about the other players, the vice‑captains, Thomas [Bjorn], the wives. It been an incredible week.” As for his long-haired friend, Molinari said: “I had an amazing partner in Tommy. It never felt like I had a rookie playing alongside me.” In guiding Europe to their sixth straight home victory, Molinari added to the trophies he shared with the winning teams of and And, singularly influential though he was at Le Golf National, he betrayed not a note of triumphalism. He represented all that is good about team sport – and, if politics might briefly be allowed to stray into the discussion - the ethic of togetherness in Europe that the Ryder Cup has championed for a quarter of a century. Molinari expressed as much joy for the combined success of his own campaign as he did commiseration for Fleetwood , whom Tony Finau, another debutant, trounced Fleetwood, the ebullient, free-hitter from Southport, was reaching for an unprecedented fifth win on debut but the weight of history seemed to bear down on his rounded shoulders. Enthusiasm, nerves or both might have got the better of him on the hole, when an overcooked wedge from a greenside bunker above the hole dribbled into the drink, and he never properly recovered. The Cup, technically, was put out of reach of the US team a few moments before Mickelson slam-dunk-splash, when he and Watson had missed putts, but those Europeans still not battling on the course gathered quickly at the to hoist Molinari skywards. Tony Jacklin, who knows about these things, said Molinari and Fleetwood (immortalised as Moliwood) reminded him of the great Spanish pairing of Seve Ballesteros and José María Olazábal, who performed wonders for him in the Certainly they have clicked like the good friends they are away from the course, each with their own hinterland. Perhaps they get along so well because they are essentially different. Fleetwood is as gregarious and outgoing as Molinari is shy and retiring. When the job was done, Fleetwood put his defeat behind him and ran to the fans who love his boyish lightheartedness. He would go on to celebrate with his wife, Clare, years older than him, and their one-year-old son, Frankie. Molinari wife, Valentina, while not the greatest enthusiast for the game, arrived from their home in London with their two children, Tommaso and Emma, to witness Francesco finest moment. As partners Molinari and Fleetwood were blessed synchronicity. For Molinari alone it was very heaven. This ought to long be remembered as Molinari Cup – a notion that would appal one of the most self-effacing players in the game.",810,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/shy-and-retiring-francesco-molinari-sweeps-clean-at-ryder-cup
2,"Europe reclaiming of the Ryder Cup will come at a cost to their captain, Thomas Bjørn , after it was revealed he promised his team he would get a tattoo bearing the winning score in the event of a triumph in France. Europe cantered to a to success against the US at Le Golf National, thereby defying pre-event underdog status. During media duties victorious European players let slip the offer Bjørn made during the Ryder Cup build-up. “It was the worst decision I made all week,” a smiling Bjørn said. “Let me put it this way, it going to go on a part that only [Bjørn partner] Grace will see. I might have to send the players a picture.” Ian Poulter, one of Bjørn victorious European players, said: “I don’t know when it going to get done but we had some extra motivation this week to make sure we put our hands back on that trophy. “As little or big as those numbers are going to be – they will be very interesting numbers to see.” Bjørn cited this European team as among the continent best in Ryder Cup history. “It up there, I have to say,” the captain said. “But it down to the players on the team. It down to what they are as their personalities and what they want to achieve. We got it right this week. We worked as a team and we knew we were up against very strong opponents, but we went out on the golf course and believed in ourselves and what we stand for as a team. “We never, ever looked towards their team about what they were about. We were about us as a team and what we do. “This is the best team room I’ve ever been in. It was calm. It was determined. It was focused. It was fun. Everything that this Ryder Cup was, is what I think the Ryder Cup should be about for a European team. It a great group. It a group that believes in themselves and what they stand for.” The captain also, rightly, felt vindicated after his experienced wildcard picks returned a combined nine and a half points. The US four selections, including Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, combined for just two. “I think I got it right,” Bjørn said. “They have been fantastic. I couldn’t have dreamt of what they brought on the golf course. They have been fantastic this week on the golf course. “But in the team room, they bring the experience. They bring the understanding. It those guys that last night sit and make sure that everybody in the right frame of mind and they are ready to go out and play because they have done it so many times before. “When you take on the captaincy, you can never dream of a scoreline like this. That obviously down to all players, but I’m extremely proud of those four guys that got picked, because it by no means easy to be picked. There pressure on you if you’re going to be picked, and they stood up, all of them this week, and showed what they are worth.” Jim Furyk, the defeated US captain, admitted his team were outplayed but offered a staunch defence of his squad. “I have every confidence in these players that you could,” Furyk said. “I think we have a great team. I would take them right back into another Ryder Cup and play it all over again if I could. You can call me crazy, but I have every belief that these guys could get it done.”",602,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/thomas-bjorn-vows-fulfil-ryder-cup-tattoo-promise
3,"Thomas Bjørn refused to contemplate either victory or defeat for Europe in the Ryder Cup . Or so he claimed. What can be said with certainty is that Bjørn, in his wildest dreams, didn’t foresee this demolition job on a United States team afforded such pre-event adulation that one wondered whether Europe should bother turning up. What the French for volte-face? Amid incredible scenes on the outskirts of Paris – with Tommy Fleetwood carried shoulder high by jubilant fans and Francesco Molinari mobbed in a manner once the domain of Italian footballers, not golfers – the true scale of Europe glory was almost forgotten. A to win ranks among their finest of all time. Bjørn – an understated, occasionally surly character – masterminded a marvellous triumph marked by flamboyancy. Europe had even afforded the US a lead after the first session, before a rout ensued. Jim Furyk team lay battered and bruised by close of play. “They outplayed us,” conceded Furyk. “Thomas was a better captain this week. We’ve got to tip our caps.” Rory McIlroy heavyweight pillow fight goes the full distance | Andy Bull Every Ryder Cup has its defining, closing moment. This one was strange, given Europe had already technically reached their magic total of points because of dormie status in ongoing singles matches. Enter Phil Mickelson, the man whose verbal volley at Tom Watson before exiting Gleneagles four years ago triggered all manner of overhauls – and supposed improvements – in the US setup. In Scotland, the margin of European victory was narrower than here. From the tee, Mickelson carved an iron shot into a lake to seal a success for the imperious Molinari. This was likely to be Mickelson final act as a Ryder Cup player. It afforded him an unwanted place in history; match losses is a record on either side. Watson is teetotal, otherwise one presumes he may have raised a glass. Karma and sport are such devilish bedfellows. Molinari five wins from as many matches render him this Ryder Cup standout player. A typically low-key sort, the Italian emerged so brilliantly from his shell over three days in France. “This means so much to me,” said the Open champion. “So much more than majors, more than anything. It hard not to get emotional when you think about the other players, the vice captains, Thomas, the wives. It been an incredible week.” Nobody typified Bjørn immaculate leadership more than Sergio García. There was widespread criticism when the Masters champion was handed a wildcard spot, to a level that visibly jolted the captain. Not only did García perfectly justify his selection, he strode into the record books on Sunday. A singles win over Rickie Fowler means García is now the leading European points winner of all time, his haul of surpassing Nick Faldo. Bjørn isn’t the type, but he would be entitled to call out his earlier detractors. For a brief Sunday afternoon spell, as seemed amazing in the aftermath, there were home concerns. Rory McIlroy fell to a narrow defeat against Justin Thomas and Webb Simpson, surprisingly, saw off Justin Rose. A US comeback to match what Europe produced in Medinah six years ago suddenly wasn’t such a forlorn hope. Yet, when it mattered, Europe players rebounded from the ropesresponded. It was as if the warning signs triggered a fresh, inspired level of performance. Jon Rahm found himself a hole to the good against Tiger Woods on the The Spaniard duly produced two of the shots of his life to leave only for the match. Rahm made no mistake, the scale of his subsequent celebrations conjuring memories of the great Seve Ballesteros. Rahm was briefly reduced to tears when hugged by McIlroy. No sooner had Rahm departed the penultimate hole than Ian Poulter, Mr Ryder Cup, entered. Poulter played the in very similar style to Rahm but watched his birdie attempt slide past the hole. Dustin Johnson, the world breathed again. We should have known Poulter cunning plan; to take centre stage on the final green, in front of thousands of adoring punters. The Englishman pounded his chest in delight after Johnson was defeated. Europe were within touching distance. Poulter, another wildcard, had delivered again. Tiger Woods accepts share of blame as USA Ryder Cup fightback falls flat | Sean Ingle Nobody supplied more proof of Bjørn midas touch than Thorbjørn Olesen. Attention would naturally be directed upon Olesen contribution here, such is his close friendship with Europe captain. When Bjørn left his fellow Dane out for both Saturday sessions, eyebrows were raised. That call proved inspired, like so many. Olesen was the clear underdog against Jordan Spieth but was by the tee and refused to look back. Olesen hammered the three-time major winner, It will be a shock if Olesen doesn’t become a Ryder Cup feature from here on. Paul Casey, excellent on his return to the Ryder Cup fold, secured a valiant half against Brooks Koepka. Strangely, this was the only shared point of the entire event. That Fleetwood ran out of steam was hardly surprising, albeit Tony Finau produced an outstanding putting display in winning Patrick Reed, out of sorts for two days, rallied admirably to defeat Tyrrell Hatton In typifying the fine attitudes with which this Ryder Cup was played, Reed took to self-deprecation in front of crowds who regard him as a pantomime villain before a warm embrace with Hatton. Europe regain Ryder Cup against USA – Sunday singles live! By then, Henrik Stenson had seen off Bubba Watson As Europe partied, Alex Norén and Bryson DeChambeau were in the unenviable position of trying to complete an irrelevant match. Norén didn’t care; he holed from on the last green to win McIlroy delivered the final words perfectly when assessing where it all went right. “The leadership has been great,” said the Northern Irishman. “The rookies have been phenomenal. We have won the Ryder Cup and all contributed points; that validates what Thomas did. He has been incredible.” Whatever mood and energy Bjørn summoned, Europe wish they could bottle it. The continent golfing pulse has never been stronger. Olé, Olé, Olé.",1022,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/ryder-cup-2018-europe-win-usa-golf
4,"ory McIlroy Ryder Cup ended with a concession. On the fairway he took one last desperate swing, a final, futile attempt to win the point he and Justin Thomas had been fighting over for the previous four hours. It was one of the great singles matches, a game neither man seemed able to win but which both refused to lose. But in the end McIlroy was undone by a bad lie in a fairway bunker. The first time he tried to escape it, the ball caught the lip and rolled back to his feet, the second it flew fast and far, into the water beyond the fairway. So McIlroy took a drop and one last shot at the pin from a hundred yards out. He needed to hole it to even have a hope of halving the hole. Even then, it wasn’t much of one, since he would have needed Thomas to three-putt from feet. Ryder Cup Europe rout USA to exceed Thomas Bjørn wildest dreams McIlroy played some astonishing shots over the weekend, in between a lot of ordinary and awful others, but even he could not pull off this conjuring trick. So he turned to Thomas and told him it was over. Then the two of them hugged. It had been some tussle. At the time, Thomas seemed almost as upset about the way in which it had finished. “It wasn’t a very fitting end for the match, I really feel badly about that,” Thomas said. “I’m very happy to get the point for our team, but I didn’t want to get it like that.” McIlroy and Thomas are friends, neighbours, and playing partners at the Bear Club in Florida. And when they were not trying each to beat the other they were happily yakking away. McIlroy made a generous concession after Thomas missed an eagle putt on the and even rebuked a photographer for making noise when Thomas was trying to hit his tee shot at the Which is why Thomas called their head-to-head here “a heavyweight pillow fight”. That description had a double meaning, because while they threw a lot of blows at each other they missed so many key putts that neither was able to knock the other out. Thomas took the lead at the with a superb birdie from It took some nerve because there were fans to his left, to his right, and more behind him, and they were all chanting McIlroy name. McIlroy wrenched the lead back by deft chip at the and a brilliant pitch at the On the McIlroy missed a short putt to go three-up. And that was when his day started to sour. He stood there a minute, watching it, wobbling his knees. After that he seemed to lose his touch and missed four putts from inside on the back nine. Thomas, meanwhile, kept finding himself with mid-range putts that he could not finish. So the two of them each had two turns in the lead, and they spent a long stretch all-square, too. Golf fans in their finery at Ryder Cup – in pictures When Thomas finally won, everything looked to be tipping the US way. McIlroy was licked, and the US were up in six matches. On Saturday night the US captain, Jim Furyk, said: “Any time a team come back to win they’ve made a fast start on Sunday, like we saw at Brookline, like we saw at Medinah.” He wanted Thomas to be the “sparkplug”. Thomas, a rookie, had done his part. But hardly anyone else on his team did. “From there it looked like we were in pretty good position,” Furyk said. “There looked like there was a spark of light.” It didn’t last. It says plenty that Furyk felt he had to heap all that responsibility on a rookie. Thomas has been the US best player through the week, winning four out of the five points for which he competed, his only defeat defeat with Jordan Spieth against Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari in the foursomes on Friday. He was also the only player in the who was so committed to winning here that he was happy to come over to play in the French Open in July, not just because he wanted to get to know the course, but because he knew it would be a statement of intent. This defeat seemed to really sting him, despite his famous win over Europe best player. “It doesn’t matter what you do in singles,” Thomas said later. “We all said that last night. I’ll gladly lose my match if the team wins, I’d gladly go and in every Ryder Cup in my career if that means we win every one I play.” McIlroy, though, could not have been any happier, despite his loss. “The great thing about today is that we all won Ryder Cup points,” he said. “Jon Rahm got a point and Thorbjǿrn got a point and I’m delighted for them, because it means that all of us did.” As for Thomas, he says two years can’t pass fast enough.",849,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/rory-mcilroy-heavyweight-pillow-fight-goes-full-distance
5,"Should Lewis Hamilton go on to secure the world championship this year, his win at the Russian Grand Prix will be the only victory in a superlative season from which he will take no pleasure. His victory, ensured the moment Mercedes employed orders allowing him to pass his teammate, Valtteri Bottas , proved an ill-sitting success defined by the decidedly uncelebratory figures of the Mercedes drivers on the podium as well as their team below them. Hamilton has been explicit in the past in his desire for the team not to employ orders and was uncomfortable with their use in Russia after he took the flag in front of Bottas. “It is definitely a win on my list of wins that I am least proud of,” he said. “The strangest day I can remember in my career. I want to win the right way. As racing drivers we exist to win; if you tell us we can’t, it is like you are taking our life away. I would never wish it on someone else and I would never ask for it ever. I made sure in a meeting that they knew this is not how I want to win.” Lewis Hamilton wins the Russian Grand Prix – live! There was the expected disapproval that the distasteful spectre of team orders always provokes yet the decision was unsurprising. Team orders have long been legal in and Mercedes, aware of Ferrari strong challenge this year, were unwilling to leave anything to chance. It is an unedifying way for a race to be decided but it was both understandable and planned for. With Sebastian Vettel finishing third, Hamilton extended his title lead to points, a gain, as opposed to the three-point boost second place would have delivered. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, charged with returning a drivers’ and constructors’ title, was as ruthless as his board members would have wanted. “It deflating for drivers and for a team but there is a harsh reality also,” he said. “On a day like this you can extend the lead by seven points more in a championship that has been very tough and difficult at times, so you have to take it.” Hamilton echoed his rationale given what might still happen in the five races that remain. “The team were considering the car breaking down or losing two more engines,” he said. “We could lose the championship and that was their reasoning, hard as it is to swallow.” Esteban Ocon dilemma highlights the lack of chances for young drivers in | Giles Richards Ultimately Mercedes’ decision was brought about after they had been caught on the hop by Ferrari . With Bottas leading from pole and Hamilton and Vettel settling into second and third, the Scuderia took the initiative, sending Vettel into the pits for the undercut. The move worked and after Hamilton stop he emerged behind the German. Hamilton had to charge and he pressured Vettel, who locked up through turn Hamilton closed and made an effort to pass on the run to turn two. Vettel defended but was out of position and caught in turn four when Hamilton dived up the inside to retake the place. Coming back at Vettel had been at a cost of causing some blistering to his tyres. With the German still a threat the team opted to give Hamilton Bottas place, moving the Finn into a buffering position in front of Vettel. Bottas was visibly and understandably disappointed. He has yet to win this year and, with pole and leading the race, had done everything that might be expected of him. In Hungary last year, when he moved over for Hamilton, the British driver gave the place back when he could gain no advantage. The Finn may have hoped for a repeat but, with the title at stake, it was simply not going to happen. “Lewis is fighting for the drivers’ championship and I’m not,” Bottas acknowledged. “From the team point of view it was the ideal result today. Maybe not ideal for me but for the team, yes.” Vettel knows this was another stinging blow to his title hopes and, as he races for a team who have employed team orders brutally in the past, he was understanding of Mercedes’ decision. “Well done to both of them, they played together as a team very well,” he said. As the two Mercedes drivers faced the press afterwards he even came to their defence. “All the questions – I know you guys love controversy so therefore ask naughty questions to them as individuals, but I think in the position they are it a no-brainer what they did today. Maybe not all the questions are justified.” Certainly Mercedes will not lose any sleep as they head to the next round in Japan. If Hamilton does take the title, he will still have some exceptional performances to remember long after the discomfort of this one is forgotten but he will also remember he has cause to be thankful to Bottas. “Never, ever in my whole life has it been the way I’ve wanted to win a race,” he said. “I just want to shine it on to Valtteri. There are not many teammates who would do something like that.”",878,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/lewis-hamilton-wins-russian-grand-prix-mercedes-team-orders-sebastian-vettel

7,"An epic day of racing was given a fitting sountrack for its denouement. As a select group of riders ascended the Höttinger Höll climb – with a fearsome maximum gradient of – the organisers of the UCI Road World Championships blared AC/DC Highway to Hell throughout Innsbruck. Almost seven hours after the men road race began on Sunday only a handful of contenders remained. Ultimately it was the veteran Alejandro Valverde who found heaven. The Spaniard has contested the world championships times since his debut in Twice he had secured silver medals, four times he claimed bronze. On his attempt the gained the illustrious rainbow stripes. Valverde outsprinted France Romain Bardet, the Canadian Michael Woods and the Dutchman Tom Dumoulin into Innsbruck. His primal screams of celebration said it all. “This is the victory I have been longing for,” an emotional Valverde said afterwards, clad in the rainbow jersey with a dazzling gold medallion around his neck. “It was my biggest dream to become a world champion. I have been chasing this win forever. I had six medals but none were gold.” On a sunny morning in western Austria riders departed Kufstein to confront the toughest world championships course in more than two decades. A large banner in the historic centre of nearby Innsbruck declared: “A good day for a ride.” The peloton might have disagreed, with to traverse and vertical metres of climbing ahead. After some initial tussling an exuberant breakaway began working together to establish an advantage. The lead stretched out to almost minutes on the opening climb, before Austria and Great Britain upped the ante in the peloton. But the lead did not narrow as much as the bunch would have liked and, for a time, there were legitimate fears that the break could stay away. It was not until the kilometre marker dipped towards double digits that the gap narrowed. Anna van der Breggen wins road world championships with astonishing ride When the pace quickened there were notable casualties within the brightly coloured peloton. The newly crowned world time trial champion, Rohan Dennis, and defending world road race champion, Peter Sagan, were both dropped with the finish still away, the exertion on many laps of the Igls ascent proving too much. As the gap slimmed to five minutes with remaining, the well-represented nations began shadow boxing in the peloton. Italy had a go, Spain responded. The victor Michal Kwiatkowski of Poland joined the fun as, a little later, did Belgium Greg Van Avermaet. The Olympic champion briefly led a group away from the peloton and, although it amounted to nothing, Van Avermaet attack did serve to drop Kwiatkowski and Britain Simon Yates from the accelerating peloton. With the pace high, the day-long lead group continued to thin. Soon Norway Vegard Stake Laengen and the Dane Kasper Asgreen were the last men standing, ultimately caught on the penultimate climb. And so it came down to the Höttinger Höll ascent, truly hell for the decimated peloton after so many painful hours in the saddle. Only an elite selection remained to contest the last climb. The grimaces were unmistakable – a fearsome ascent taming some of the sport best climbers, in a crowd-filled cauldron of atmosphere on the outskirts of Innsbruck. Only four survived for the final sprint. A decade and a half after first seeking the rainbow jersey, it would finally belong to Valverde.",566,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/evergreen-alejandro-valverde-top-of-world
8,"Watch out for Kieran Pender report from Innsbruck, which we’ll have for you soon. The TV coverage has cut out before we can see Valverde take his gong – but what a worthy champion he was, and what a race we saw there, building up to a remarkable climax. Those who took part deserve a rest; I’m going off for one now too. Thanks very much indeed for your company, as ever – enjoy the rest of your weekend! Top in full: – Valverde – Bardet – Woods – Dumoulin – Moscon – Kreuziger – Valgren – Alaphilippe – Pinot – Costa Pete Kennaugh, another fine performer until the last, speaks: “I feel sick now! But what a race. I didn’t expect it to be so hard early on, the break took a while to go. It was really strange without radios, there was one point when I looked behind on the climb and there were or guys left. It was like a war of attrition all day.” A deserving winner? I think so. Valverde just got stronger and stronger, earning the rainbow jersey. But there were so many fine performances there. Dumoulin came in from nowhere to push so hard at the end. Valgren really helped spice things up at the end. The members of that remarkably durable lead group, who kept going for so long, helped make this the right and totally unpredictable race this was. And we hardly even saw the favourite, Alaphilippe, until he entered the fringes of the chase at the end. Valverde looks as if he can’t quite believe it. What a race that was! The final few kilometres were absolutely incredible. It thinned out like this at the end: – Valverde Bardet – Woods – Dumoulin – Moscon Alejandro Valverde wins the road race championships! The is world champion at last! Twice second, four times third – and this time he done it! Updated at BST to go: Valverde is leading this home - unless we get a late charge ... to go: Don’t quite rule out Gianni Moscon yet ... meanwhile Dumoulin makes to attack but Valverde strikes out himself. He got this in the bag if he keeps going a few metres more ... to go: It these four – Bardet, Valverde, Woods, Dumoulin – slugging it out at the last ... to go: He clearly got an issue with his rear break, he fiddling with it there, but if he can attack those front three in the final two kilometres ... Updated at BST to go: Hello, Dumoulin is catching up! What mechanical problems? He just three seconds behind and can scent blood! What a recovery! to go: That better! Bardet takes over. They’re near the bottom now – then it a sprint on the flat. Dumoulin is still about, but seconds behind. Moscon is fifth I think. Valverde is ahead, Bardet second, Woods third. He is strong on the descent and if he can stretch it out here ... and meanwhile there word that Dumoulin may have a mechanical issue! That’ll be it for him surely. Yes, very impressive of the broadcasters to take the remaining distance off the screen right as we enter the last knockings. Alaphilippe is shown now but I don’t think he is going to feature here. We have Bardet, Valverde and Woods, with Dumoulin in pursuit, in the running as they begin their descent. Five or six kilometres left! They’ve reached the top and Valverde, so often the bridesmaid, steps up before Bardet pushes clear! Woods is now a clear third, Dumoulin fourth. The kilometre count has disappeared from my screen, so apologies for a lack of precision. to go: Woods has really come through here. The Canadian could even do this if he can make it to the top in front! The crowd roar them on. This is quite something; this is what we’ve waited seven hours or so for! to go: It as if they are treading water. This is as brutal as everyone said. Michael Woods is currently in the lead. Dumoulin making a move too on him, Valverde, Bardet and – I think – Pinot. to go: Valgren is caught up by the French contingent – and Romain Bardet takes charge! Valverde is in there too. to go: The French are lining up to try and help Alaphilippe through; the peloton is starting to split again. Valgren has the face of a man who knows something unpleasant may be tailing him. He glances behind him. The gap is seconds. I’m not sure he can hold on. This looks *so* painful, ascending these narrow mountain streets. to go: What a finale we are in for here! Game ON! to go: In pursuit are, mainly, Italian and Dutch riders at the moment. Now Valgren starts this much-trailed, utterly hellish-sounding climb with an advantage of half a minute. Is it enough? to go: His advantage is now seconds. Who would dare to strain every sinew to give chase at this point? There a climb to get ready for ... but a leader to close in on. It tight and tense and tactical! to go: Valgren has completed his descent, now has to work the flat on the outskirts of the city, and then has to prepare for the climb on his own. He needs to really put something into this section. to go: Pinot and Kennaugh are foremost among a pack of six who are chasing Valgren – the pressure could yet be on. to go: Valgren has a chance here; you sense he knows it. One huge climb to go ... to go: Valgren has opened himself up a four or five-second lead. The peloton is incredibly well staffed, this race has really taken a long time to thin out properly and that makes it so, so hard to call. to go: Kennaugh probably can’t keep this up, he really gritting his teeth here, it now Michael Valgren in front. And the Dane is pushing on promisingly ... to go: Wow! Pete Kennaugh makes one heck of a charge ahead of the entire peloton! Is he going to lead this race into its latter stages? He out there in front and now the big guns are going to have to do something! to go: Laengen and Asgreen are, at long, long last, overhauled. What a day from them, though! Van Avermaet then slows up, that second charge having been one too many. It brutal climbing, this. Many of the big names are now starting to show, but some are yet to ... to go: Yes, it the Dutch attacking the climb here. Ten seconds’ gap to the leaders ... to go: Oh, Nibali drops from the front of the group! Is that him done? Never say never with him, but I’d be surprised if he was back. If you’ve been with us since the start of the day, you’re getting your reward now! to go: Steven Kruijswijk makes an attack now, and Van Avermaet is back too! He seemed to have faded but he charges on now with the Dutchman. Thibaut Pinot is up there too. The Italians aren’t having it their own way anymore! to go: We’re now down to one minute for the leaders’ gap. I think they’ll be overhauled soon enough, sadly, before they can genuinely have a tilt at an upset. to go: Asgreen and Laengen are only one and a half minutes ahead now. Caruso and Brambilla drop back from the front of the chase, they’ve done their job there. That final climb could be quite special as things stand. to go: Nibali is up there too. There are five or six of them. It some sight! to go: Still no Alaphilippe. Still no Valverde. Will one of them just pelt it clear at the last? Are they saving it all until the final It the Italian team taking all the responsibility out there at the moment, in a mass break of their very own at the front of the peloton. to go: Adam Yates is still in the first chase group – so he well in the mix ... to go: That lead is now down to though, and they’ll want to at least consolidate it before the climb. Caruso and Brambilla are the Italian contingent giving closest chase. to go: The leading pair start their last lap – but it a bigger lap with the huge “road to hell” climb of and a gradient, remember. Neither of them is renowned for this sort of thing. They couldn’t ... could they? to go: That Van Avermaet charge came to nothing, incidentally, but I think played an important part in stepping things up a notch or two. to go: That last climb seemed to cull a lot of the peloton members although, in the descent, we might see one or two come back into play. It still a pretty big group in there and we’re still yet to see one of the major favourites make a big play for the front. to go: If anything, those two at the front are stretching their lead very slightly. What is going to happen in the next minutes or so?! to go: It really getting busy now. The Italians are currently impressing, led by Caruso. They have a good chance here as we stand. Asgreen and Laengen are the two remaining from that front pack and at this point who on earth would completely discount them? to go: There now a group of nine or so riders getting away, and they’re just two minutes and seconds behind the rump of that lead pack. to go: Michal Kwiatkowski is also having issues. Who going to be left at the end?! to go: Haven’t mentioned the favourite, Alaphilippe, yet. He just couched in there, not making any kind of move yet. A bit of a concern here meanwhile about Simon Yates – he dropping off and I fear that probably means no way back on a day like this. He out of the running. to go: The peloton is really starting to string out and split now. Van Avermaet has a few interested parties on his tail here. There all sorts going on up there. It time to attack! to go: Damiano Caruso and Omar Fraile Materanz are up there now in that Van Avermaet break – it those three pushing at the moment, chasing hard. They’ll surely be joined soon. to go: The Yates brothers are starting to make a bit of a move.

9,"Few will remember this contest with affection but winning ugly, at this precise moment, is perfectly fine with Leicester . Had they lost at home to the league basement dwellers Sale and recorded a fourth defeat in five games a proper East Midlands crisis would have had to be declared. As it is, the Tigers now lie seventh in the table, no cause for celebration but enough to call off the hounds for the time being. To describe this as a revival, though, would be strictly relative. Leicester were outscored by three tries to one and, had the Sharks shown even a fraction more composure in their opponents’ the outcome would have been very different. Without George Ford all-round influence, Kyle Eastmond try and the unceasing efforts of, among others, Guy Thompson and Graham Kitchener, the Tigers might have endured another sorry Sunday. Sale also missed all three of their conversions plus an eminently kickable first-half penalty, in stark contrast to Ford who slotted everything for a personal tally of points. On three occasions, furthermore, when the visitors looked about to grab a potentially game-defining try, they came away with nothing. Will Cliff knocked on wastefully at the base of a scrum, Sam James failed to find touch with a mishit penalty kick to the corner – two of Sale five-pointers came from lineout drives – and, under the posts with three minutes left, Josh Beaumont was unluckily penalised for not releasing under pressure from Thompson. As Leicester interim head coach, Geordan Murphy, acknowledged: “The points and win are important but I thought our performance was below par.” In such a dog-eat-dog league he is well aware the Tigers will have to sharpen up considerably, with very little separating the clubs between fourth and in the table. The Sharks may be rock bottom now but there is every prospect of them being significantly harder to beat in the near future when key players such as Chris Ashton, James O’Connor and Faf De Klerk become available again. They are particularly looking forward to welcoming back their buzzing scrum-half De Klerk who, it has emerged, will not be involved at all with South Africa during the November Tests. In return for releasing him for his country Rugby Championship fixtures, Sale have negotiated first call on him next month with the Springboks also set to face England without their other Premiership-based players Willie le Roux, Nizaam Carr and Francois Louw. As Steve Diamond was quick to stress, the South Africa game at Twickenham technically falls outside the international window, which means Premiership Rugby are not obliged to release players despite the fact there are not any Premiership fixtures scheduled that weekend. “After Newcastle this Friday Faf comes back to us pretty much full time,” Diamond confirmed. “We didn’t see the benefit of bringing him back during the break weeks, so he’ll come back to us after the Rugby Championship.” A half-decent goal-kicker would certainly have assisted the Sharks here, with the late withdrawal of the fly-half AJ MacGinty also reducing their ability to play a territorial game. They did start reasonably well with a sixth-minute try from Marland Yarde but in terms of skill and execution on both sides the game at no stage threatened to rival the rich golfing drama unfolding across the Channel. Even after Ford had kicked his fourth penalty to put Leicester ahead with three minutes left the hosts contrived to make life unnecessarily difficult for themselves, conceding a third try to a close-range drive finished off by the replacement Curtis Langdon with a restart still to come. Had Rohan Janse van Rensburg touched down Ford long drop-out it would have led to a scrum back on halfway with Sale still in the hunt. It somehow summed up the day that the ball was instead allowed to roll dead, prompting the referee, Craig Maxwell-Keyes, to blow the final whistle.

(For those of you who prefer the non-metric system, it Officially, they’re saying Cambage has averaged points per game, nearly nine points ahead of the second-top scorer, Belgium Emma Meesseman. She has only played minutes per game, so even the mathematically challenged can see she averaging more than a point a minute.

The USA will counter with its own player, Brittney Griner. Preamble The USA-USSR rivalry in women basketball is long gone, and Russia hasn’t been a factor in recent years. And we’re not getting a USA-Europe matchup here, which just gives European fans more time to celebrate the Ryder Cup rout. Host Spain won the all-European third-place matchup against Belgium earlier today. But the matchup we have instead is every bit as compelling. The U.S. women can count their losses in World Cup and Olympic competition over the past years on one hand, but this final will not be easy. Australia upset the hosts in the semifinals after cruising through the group stage and the quarterfinals. The Opals are also the last team other than the USA to win this trophy, back in so this is indeed a battle of the last two champions. Thanks for joining us for what should be a barnburner.

13,"s the boozy cries of “Olé! Olé!” reverberated around Le Golf National on Sunday night a sullen Tiger Woods offered a brutal assessment of his own performance in America defeat . “I’m one of the contributing factors to why we lost the Ryder Cup, and it not a lot of fun,” he said. “It disappointing because I went and that four points to the European team.” It is now years since the US have won in Europe, yet for the briefest moments during the afternoon they allowed themselves to entertain the impossible despite starting the day behind. Jim Furyk side were ahead in four of the opening six singles and tied in two others, and Tiger was on the prowl. It turned out to be the cruellest of illusions. The final score of was the third widest margin by a European team. Ryder Cup Europe rout USA to exceed Thomas Bjørn wildest dreams Woods partly blamed himself for checking the US momentum. He had fought his way back from two down to all square after holes but then was unable to deliver in the clutch. “The tee shot on was big,” he said after losing against Jon Rahm. “I didn’t put it in play. I then made back-to-back bogeys and consequently the matched slipped into his favour.” Woods is the greatest player who ever lived but the Ryder Cup remains his kryptonite. His competition CV now stands at won lost with three ties. Only last week it appeared that he was back near his best having won the Tour Championship . Yet all week he has looked stiff and tired, perhaps the legacy of playing seven weeks in the past nine. “It frustrating because I just didn’t perform at the level that I had been playing,” he said. “I got behind early in the matches and never got back. We were all coming here on a high and excited about playing this week but we didn’t execute like we had planned and wanted to.” Furyk was a popular captain but questions will be asked about some of his decisions, especially given that three of his four captain picks – Woods, Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau – did not win a point between them. Eyebrows were certainly raised about the decision to pick Mickelson and DeChambeau for the afternoon foursomes on the first day – especially given that Mickelson is ranked out of players in driving accuracy on the PGA Tour. The US had been up, yet Mickelson and DeChambeau were thumped by Sergio García and Alex Norén as the US endured the worst session defeat in their Ryder Cup history. Rory McIlroy heavyweight pillow fight goes the full distance | Andy Bull It was also surprising that Webb Simpson, who made six birdies in beating Rose in the singles, did not play more – especially given his excellent form around TPC at Sawgrass, the US course that most resembles Le Golf National. However, the US players may want to look at themselves, too. Everyone knew Le Golf National put a premium on accuracy and local knowledge. But six of the US team were competing on it for the first time this week – with only America best player, Justin Thomas, bothering to make the trip over to the French Open this summer. Not that Furyk saw it that way. “I had a lot of folks who came for a practice round about days after,” he said. “We were well prepared.” Furyk accepted that he would take most of the blame for the defeat but the US captain insisted he would not change much even in hindsight. “I realise the brunt of it is going to be on my plate but I have every confidence in those guys,” he said. “I would take them right back into another Ryder Cup if I could. It was an honour to serve as their captain.” Furyk also denied that fatigue was a factor, despite most of his players playing in the FedEx Cup beforehand. “That would be making an excuse,” he said. “The course set-up was very good on a golf course they [Europe] know very well. But at the end of the day their captain did a better job than I did and I tip my cap off to him.” Le Golf National is full of watery graves, and it was Mickelson who finally sunk the US team chances when he clouted the ball into the drink on the Four years ago at Gleneagles, he had ripped into the US captain Tom Watson, but he refused to put the knife into Furyk. “This is an awesome team and our captain is one of the best people in golf,” he said. “The European side played some exquisite golf and they flat out beat us.” Meanwhile Brooks Koepka was more blunt about what went wrong. “The Europeans kept making those footers for par all week,” he said. “We ran into a buzzsaw.”",827,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/tiger-woods-accepts-blame-us-ryder-cup-defeat-europe
14,"oe Denly experienced an eight‑year gap between the last of white-ball caps and his recent call-up for England Test tour to Sri Lanka. By his own admission he went missing for too much of it. But now and revelling in a two-year purple patch that has seen him end the summer with a cheque for as county cricket most valuable player, this elegant Kent right-hander and self‑taught leg-spinner has a second chance to live out a dream that at one stage was detrimentally all‑encompassing. “I feel much better equipped and have a much better understanding, not just technically but also of the pressures that come with playing for England,” says Denly, who after a couple of ODI half-centuries in was dropped on the eve of the World the next year and seldom considered thereafter. “Before I was worried about what people thought of me and how I looked. The belief wasn’t quite there. When I got dropped by England, everything was about getting back in the team, putting a lot of pressure on myself. Jos Buttler transformation to genuine Test player is now complete | Barney Ronay “I went missing really for two or three years. Performances and my love of the game dropped quite a bit. It got to a point where I had to start enjoying it again because my career was almost fading away. Now I’m at ease with my game.” During this spell in the wilderness Denly upped sticks from Kent to Middlesex in search of a fresh start. But after three dry years at Lord, it was in fact the return to his home city of Canterbury in while making peace with his England ambitions, that led to him striking a rich and lasting vein of form. “In the past, if I didn’t score runs, I didn’t switch off from thinking about it, whereas now failure is part of the game. There always one with your name on but keep improving and always look on the positive side,” says Denly less than an hour after his season – in which Kent were promoted to Division One – ended, as if to illustrate his point, with a duck. That score was not indicative of the past months, with centuries flowing from his blade across the three formats, including nine in first-class cricket. The leg‑spin that removed South Africa Graeme Smith with his first ball in international cricket has matured, too, to the extent that he can be considered more than a part‑timer. Denly is a batsman first and foremost, however, and after hearing he was on the radar of Ed Smith, his former Kent teammate who is now the national selector, this one-time opener pushed himself back up a spot to No to get nearer to the new Dukes ball in a summer where others were trying desperately to get away from it. “When your name spoken around the circuit your ears prick up a bit and you begin to think it could happen,” says Denly. “I didn’t hear anything until the day I got picked but I’d had the odd text from Paul Farbrace [England assistant coach] to say congratulations on the runs I was scoring. I started at No this year as I was captaining and bowling, a bit like Joe Root. But then I thought I wouldn’t do myself any harm at No with the talk going around. In terms of where I see myself batting for England, to bat or would be amazing.” The retirement of Alastair Cook means Denly, Rory Burns, Keaton Jennings and Moeen Ali will now be vying for three spots in November three‑Test series. While the case for Burns was compelling, Denly slightly more left‑field inclusion has the finger prints of Smith all over it for two reasons. The first is Smith belief that some players require longer to blossom; not all talent is best hot-housed from a young age. Secondly Smith is putting greater stock in leagues as he looks to repeat some of the alchemy that led to Jos Buttler stunning Test return . Denly thrived in this regard last winter, bouncing from the Bangladesh Premier League into similarly positive stints in Australia Big Bash (where he has since been retained by the Sydney Sixers) and the Pakistan Super League. “If you’re not involved in international cricket and the pressures that come with that,” Denly says, “the next best thing is not only to perform on the county stage but to get your name in big competitions around the world. That been a massive thing for my confidence and belief – a great stepping stone into international cricket.” Relaxed, confident and still blessed with the athleticism that saw him play football for Charlton academy as a teenager, this late bloomer from the Garden of England now appears well placed to make up for lost time.",809,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/joe-denly-england-i-went-missing-for-two-or-three-years
15,"Giancarlo Stanton hit the New York Yankees’ home run of the season on Saturday – extending a Major League Baseball record – with a drive to left field, then got a surprise. A strong-armed fan sitting in the seats above the Boston Red Sox’ famous Green Monster threw the souvenir back, and the ball bounced into Stanton as he rounded second base. Boston fans cheered when the fan let loose and Stanton smiled when the throw reached him on a bounce. Stanton gave a quick salute to the man.&nbsp;“I wouldn’t have thought it got to me that fast with a fan throwing it. I’ve never seen it happen before,” Stanton said.&nbsp;The fan was later escorted out of the stadium by security. Gleyber Torres and Stanton ensured the playoff-bound Yankees now have the major league record for most home runs in a season, as they beat the Red Sox for their win this year.&nbsp;“I’m happy for them.

16,"Another weekend, another points fest. This one topped the odd try in earning Northampton their second win of the season. Under Chris Boyd, the improvement in their game has been obvious; here, it yielded the full five points. It meant Bristol first home loss of their return to the top flight fell at the third instalment, but they took two bonus points themselves to keep both sides nestled amid the customarily crowded mid-table. Nathan Earle tries lead Harlequins to narrow win at Gloucester Ian Madigan pulled out, but his replacement, Callum Sheedy, who qualifies to play for Wales, Ireland and England, played masterfully, accruing points and coaxing as much artistry from Bristol as Madigan might have done himself. If this league is meant to be damaging England chances of playing the vibrant rugby so ardently wished for, the logic is hard to follow. Players looked for, and found, space and, when it was not to be found, collisions of rather more than a couple of Gs kept the purists happy. In the end, the difference was a try, which made the one denied Bristol shortly before the break all the more controversial. With the score locked at Andy Uren was through to the line. He had been tackled a few yards short, his knee touching the ground for a moment, but the question was whether he had been held by the tackler. The TMO thought not; Luke Pearce, whose opinion counted, thought so. “I know it was a try,” said Pat Lam, the Bristol coach whose birthday was spoiled here by his former club. “The TMO was right and so was the touch-judge, but Luke felt differently. I know what going to be said when it goes to review. It was a huge moment, because it switched from in our favour to the other way. But credit to Northampton.” It was a curious decision by Pearce, who cannot have seen anything the rest of us could not. If that was harsh, a penalty seemed ridiculous, but them the rules. All the harsher, Northampton kicked the penalty to touch, worked a few phases and suddenly Lewis Ludlam was stepping to the line at the other end. Northampton had a lead they would not relinquish. By then that lead had changed hands liberally. Dan Biggar had opened the scoring with a penalty, but the riot of tries was swift to ensue. Will Hurrell broke powerfully past Biggar for the first of his brace, after fine work by the increasingly eye-catching Harry Thacker. The hooker showcased his remarkable pace for Bristol second on the half-hour, but in between Northampton had scored twice – raw power accounting for Ehren Painter and the contrasting virtues of Northampton wingers for Andrew Kellaway. Alex Goode leads the charge for irrepressible Saracens against Bath And so the match was poised perfectly before its controversial turning point. Even after that, Sheedy penalty reduced Bristol arrears to four on the stroke of half-time. Taqele Naiyaravoro, the bulldozing version of Northampton wingers, went through two to claim Northampton fourth four minutes into the second half, only for some Sheedy wizardry to lay one on for Luke Morahan four minutes later. Sheedy third penalty reduced the deficit to one. The game was anyone. It was Northampton who made it theirs. Close-quarter power was one department in which they enjoyed the edge throughout. Alex Waller and Mikey Haywood proved as much with tries of directness either side of the hour mark. Bristol were staring at a deficit all of a sudden, this time with only quarter of an hour to go. They scored twice in the remaining time, each try coming with a bonus point, each one a sweeping move of majesty. They were the scores of a team who know how to play, but everyone seems to know how to play this season. Someone is going to have to be relegated.",649,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/bristol-northampton-premiership-match-report
17,"For all that Saracens’ swashbuckling style, led by the irrepressible Alex Goode, caught the eye in a record-breaking fifth consecutive bonus point win, it is Todd Blackadder post-match revelation – that the sum total of Bath ambitions was a losing bonus point – which resonates most. Blackadder made changes to his side, resting his two England squad members and a raft of senior players at a ground where Bath are accustomed to heavy defeats. “We are creating more depth, we are freshening people up and we are learning about ourselves,” he said. “Even though we didn’t get what we were after, all we were really after was chasing a bonus point today.” It must be said that Bath rallied to trail by just six points at half-time and Blackadder was adamant that “you don’t prepare to lose”, but his admission is nonetheless startling. Blackadder argument is that Bath host Exeter on Friday, then have two Champions Cup matches and after an injury-hit campaign last season he saw the chance to expose his squad players to the white heat of battle. “I absolutely stand by it,” he added. “We’re trying to break the habit of breaking people all the time. I’d rather bring these young guys to play against the best so that they know what the benchmark is. Otherwise we’ll just end up playing our best team every single week and we’ll end up breaking guys. I just don’t think that the way forwards.” The counterpoint is that Bath came into the match fourth in the table and are a club with an illustrious history but at a time when a England prop has just retired from international duty, Blackadder argument is at the very least timely, all the more so with the Rugby Football Union, in association with Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Players’ Association, soon to announce the new domestic structure. He denied it was anything to do with England training camp in Bristol, which ran from last Sunday to Tuesday, but left Joe Cokanasiga and Zach Mercer out of the squad completely. Meanwhile, there were nine Saracens players away with England and eight of them started, causing their chairman, Nigel Wray, to lament in his programme notes a “difficult week” in which his club had been “penalised”. Perhaps it is no coincidence then that Goode, by a distance the star turn, is England forgotten man. Eddie Jones clearly sees something he does not like but when he is performing with this type of spidery elusiveness he is a joy to behold. “It says a lot about his hunger to play at the highest level,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. “He still wants to play for England and he works incredibly hard for it.” After eight here, Saracens have now scored tries so far this season and they are the first ever side to start a campaign with five straight bonus point wins. If there was a downside it was a nasty-looking facial injury to Brad Barritt, but Liam Williams finished the match with his second hat-trick of the season and Goode was majestic, breaking Bath line at will. It seems staggering he has not played for England since November After an opening Rhys Priestland penalty, Williams finished off a lovely move from left to right before Goode ran a superb line to take Alex Lozowski fizzing pass for the second try. Priestland added another penalty but Jamie George was barged over from the back of a driving lineout and Saracens were threatening to run riot. The procession did not materialise as Chris Cook picked off Richard Wigglesworth pass for an interception try before Nick Tompkins dummied over for Saracens’ bonus-point score. Tom Homer was on hand for another Bath try before the break – for all that the hosts impressed in attack this was not their best defensive performance by a stretch – but Williams had his second and third soon after the interval, Goode making yet another fine break and offload for the second of those. Bath stayed in the hunt with another intercept, this time from Homer, but Sean Maitland then got in on the act on the left for Saracens’ seventh score and the replacement hooker, Christopher Tolofua, added the eighth from another driving lineout.",714,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/saracens-bath-premiership-match-report
18,"Cooper Cronk made a miraculous return from a shoulder injury but couldn’t steer his new side Sydney Roosters to victory over his old club Melbourne Storm in the NRL grand final, instead it was his halfback partner Luke Keary who did the damage in an emphatic win. The Roosters stopped the Storm making history, in their quest to become the first club to win back-to-back premierships since Brisbane Broncos years ago, and to send out the retiring Billy Slater a winner, with an electric first-half display at ANZ Stadium on Sunday night, in front of Trent Robinson charges bullied and bashed Melbourne in the opening stages, forcing error after error to build an unassailable lead. It was Keary, supported ably by Greg Inglis-clone Latrell Mitchell with a one-armed Cronk largely a passenger, ensuring the Roosters captured their first title since NRL grand final Sydney Roosters v Melbourne Storm - live! Slater and Cronk dominated the headlines in the week leading up to the decider, the fullback fighting a shoulder charge ban and the halfback on a “will he/won’t he play” battle to recover his injured shoulder. In the end both veterans were available, the conjecture proving futile, though both had minimal impact on the result. Slater didn’t get the fairytale finish he craved and his close friend, though limited in effectiveness, completed the job he was signed from the Storm to do. The Roosters edged ahead after just three minutes through a Mitchell penalty goal, after the Victorians were caught holding down in the tackle. They made it just four minutes later following a Felise Kaufusi knock-on that heaped more pressure on Melbourne try-line. With the competition two best defensive teams against each other, space and attacking opportunities were expected to be rare. But a floating cut-out pass from Luke Keary caught Suliasi Vunivali badly out of position and Daniel Tupou strolled over with ease. Mitchell couldn’t convert from the sideline but it was the minor premiers who were dominant in the early period. Their defence was brutal, they were making metres comfortably and every hit-up was carried out with relish. The Storm were making uncharacteristic mistakes and the boisterous Bondi outfit made them pay. In the minute they were in again, this time Mitchell brushing past Will Chambers to cross and then adding the extras to put Melbourne on notice. At down Craig Bellamy men were in trouble. They should have been behind just four minutes later, but Sio Siua Tuakeiaho lost the ball as he tried to steamroll Slater on the line. It was the first piece of luck the Storm had received and they badly needed it. Slowly they crept back into the contest, forcing a goal-line dropout and building some pressure. But the Roosters would not yield, Mitchell making it his mission to monster Chambers at every opportunity. It was State of Origin déjà vu for the Melbourne centre. The Storm night went from bad to worse on minutes when Cameron Munster was sin-binned for a professional foul. Nelson Asofa-Solomona knocked on and Jake Friend sprinted away, only to be hauled down by Josh Addo-Carr. However, Munster held him down too long and was promptly marched for minutes. Mitchell kicked the Roosters into a lead that was becoming increasingly untouchable. Six minutes later that lead became and it was virtually game over. The Roosters caught the Storm a defender short on the right and Joseph Manu touched down. At half-time Melbourne were left licking their wounds after a near-perfect minutes of Roosters rugby league. Bellamy men needed divine intervention. But the second half continued much like the first – Storm error, Roosters’ efficiency and quickly threatening the opposition line. On minutes only the touchline stopped Blake Ferguson grabbing the Tricolours’ third try. Melbourne thought they had finally got the breakthrough they craved when Munster crossed in the minute. But Asofa-Solomona had knocked over Cronk in the lead-up and the video referee chalked it off. Three minutes later Munster should have been in again, but Manu made an amazing defensive play to somehow knock the ball lose. It took the Storm minutes to eventually score, Addo-Carr picking off a Keary pass and racing away metres for the try. But it mattered little in the scheme of things as the Roosters would not be bowed. With minutes left on the clock Keary iced the contest with a field goal. There was still time for Munster to be sin-binned again this time for a petulant kick to a prone Manu head, with Mitchell adding two more points. The diminutive playmaker from Ispwich had been in his more illustrious halves partner Cronk shadow all season, but stood tall with the pressure heaped on in the match that mattered most.",789,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/roosters-run-riot-to-deny-nrl-grand-final-repeat-for-the-storm
19,"She had won gold at the Olympic Games and European Championships. She had won the Giro Rosa and La Course by Tour de France. But for so long, success at the UCI Road World Championships had proven elusive for Anna van der Breggen. On four occasions the Dutchwoman had placed in the road race top including second in Three times she had won the individual time trial silver medal, most recently on Tuesday. But as her compatriots Annemiek van Vleuten and Chantal Blaak added world titles to their palmares in recent years, the rainbow jersey remained conspicuously absent from Van der Breggen record. That changed here on Saturday. In an astonishing piece of solo riding, Van der Breggen bridged to a strong breakaway on the penultimate climb of the road race. She then attacked again, effortlessly riding away from Australia Amanda Spratt. Completing the last without company, the Boels-Dolmans rider never looked at risk of being caught. As she crossed the finish line, the relief was unmistakable. Finally, Van der Breggen could rightfully claim to be the best female rider in the world. Her lead over Spratt was the biggest winning margin in decades. Italy Tatiana Guderzo claimed bronze. Anna van der Breggen storms to women world road race cycling glory Van der Breggen had dedicated her season to the world championships, bypassing the defence of her Giro Rosa jersey and adopting an unorthodox race schedule – even including some mountain biking. But she said the singular focus had added pressure. “I was happy this morning that tonight, no matter how it went, it would be over and I could enjoy cycling again,” she said. But the smile on her face suggested it had all been worthwhile. “When I crossed the finish line it was relief – that it finally worked out,” she said. “I won it this time. I am really thankful for that.” An elated Spratt heaped praise on her victorious rival: “She was on another level. She really showed that she was so, so strong. I’m proud of the silver medal.” A total of riders began the first climber-friendly world championships in recent memory, rolling out of picturesque Kufstein near the German border under sunny autumn skies. The Polish team activated the race early, with Aurela Nerlo establishing a modest lead over the peloton before being joined by Colombia Ana Cristina Sanabria. The race stretched as the riders headed towards a first potent climb, with the ascent to Gnadenwald featuring sections of gradient. At one point there were four separate groups, but the key nations of the Netherlands, Australia, Italy and the United States looked untroubled. Or at least they did, until a crash at Gnadenwald base among the road furniture complicated proceedings. Van Vleuten, the pre-race favourite, and Britain Dani Rowe were among those to fall, with the former looking particularly shaken as she exerted herself to rejoin the peloton. Normality returned as the climb slimmed the main group to a select few, including Van Vleuten, before the race temporarily reformed on the descent into Innsbruck. But as the peloton passed a multinational crowd in the old city and headed back towards the mountains, the peloton thinned once more. Eventually, a serious breakaway of six formed, led by Spratt. When Ellen van Dijk was dropped, Van der Breggen went ahead of the chasers to ensure the orange-clad team would be represented at the front.

20,"Whatever happened to staple English fare? This offering was typical of what is being served up in the Premiership , fast, fluid, frantic, furious and, at times, fractious, but fulfilling? It was like gorging greedily on a rich trifle without pausing for a sip of water. There was little strategic about the play at a period in the game when possession is king – exciting but ephemeral as Harlequins won away in the league for the first time in months. It is about waiting for mistakes, as the first two tries demonstrated. Gloucester scored the first, from a lineout near their after Martin Atkinson short pass to Jake Polledri caught out the visitors’ fly-half James Lang who had shaped to tackle with his inside shoulder only to find the danger on his outside. The flanker sprinted metres before finding Danny Cipriani on his left and the outside-half comfortably outstripped the cover. Northampton secure victory in breathless encounter at Bristol Cipriani had an instrumental role in the next try four minutes later, scored by one of Harlequins’ five England squad members, Nathan Earle. Gloucester were moving left when Cipriani passed to the flanker Lewis Ludlow who was standing too flat and close. Like a batsman beaten for pace, all Ludlow could do was flick the ball on and it fell for Earle out. Earle second came from the kick-off. Harlequins moved the ball from their spotting space wide. Three quick passes put Joe Marchant into the gap and it was a question of the centre timing his pass to Earle. He waited until he had reached the home committing the cover before releasing the ball, although Gloucester full-back Tom Hudson nearly thwarted the try. From a position of comfort, Gloucester were down. They set up camp in Quins’ kicking five penalties to touch even though their mauls tended to lurch rather than roll. They eventually went for the posts, Cipriani kicking two penalties to cut his side deficit to a point. The second came after the second-row forward Matt Symons received a yellow card for his side persistent infringing. Gloucester exploited their man advantage two minutes from the interval when their forwards stormed the gainline and Atkinson long pass led to Charlie Sharples’ fifth try of the season. Quins drew level with Lang penalties either side of the interval. On top of their dismal away record, they had lost of their previous league fixtures. If Paul Gustard has not sat on defence since moving to the Stoop from Twickenham in the summer, there were times here when they, like Gloucester, needed to take a breath but this is a Premiership campaign when a team has kept its line intact only once, Exeter against Leicester on the opening weekend. Alex Goode leads the charge for irrepressible Saracens against Bath Joe Marler was making his first appearance for Harlequins since deciding to roll away from international rugby. Opposite him was Cipriani, desperate to continue at Test level but outside looking in again. As the reflected on the insistence of the England head coach, Eddie Jones, that form was his barometer, he may have asked himself how so many Quins had made it. Mike Brown was one, making his first appearance of the season and typically competitive, but it was someone who had dropped out of favour, Marcus Smith, who tilted the game after replacing Lang at No He kicked two penalties and, after Sharples had regained the lead for Gloucester minutes from time, landed a third having blown his clean break by slipping and conceding a scrum that the home prop Alex Seville rashly used his hands in after Quins’ three front-row replacements applied pressure. Gloucester had a final rally when their ploy was to get the ball to Matt Banahan, but they had not worked out a way to win and another twisted scrum marked their end on a day when even Cipriani got lost in the uniformity spawned by the relentless quest to entertain.",663,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/gloucester-harlequins-premiership-match-report
21,"ore than of the income generated globally by rugby union comes from the international game. It is the reason why those who run the sport, World Rugby, are this week gathered in Sydney pondering how to reinvigorate all the Test rugby that takes place between World Cups. Friendly matches, which make up of Test fixtures, are losing their allure. Teams arrive on tour at the end of long, arduous seasons, often below strength and not at their most motivated. New Zealand remain a draw but Australia and South Africa, who have lost dozens of players to clubs in Europe and Japan, have mutated from vaunted to vulnerable. The series of World Rugby committee meetings this week will resolve nothing. Much has been made this week of a plan to establish a League of Nations competition in November, played over five weeks. But it is one of a number of ideas that are being considered before the governing body meeting in November. What is eventually decided will look a lot different: a commitment made last year was for more fixtures between tier one and two countries. Warren Gatland wants to go out on a high with Wales over next months World Rugby Bill Beaumont and Agustin Pichot, chairman and vice-chairman respectively, are leading the push for reform, with the latter the more voluble after declaring that international rugby was heading for the scrapheap unless there was a fundamental overhaul. At its urging, World Rugby is setting up a professional game committee, made up of tier one and two nations, and is establishing a professional game forum that will meet every year. It will be made up of delegates from unions, clubs and players’ associations and it fulfils a promise made last year in San Francisco to take a collaborative approach to the issues. There will be major changes made to the international calendar and making the November and July windows competitive will add to the load on players. While there would still be three weekends in each month governed by World Rugby regulation on player release, coaches would want two weeks of preparation time. That would make weeks in all which, added to the nine weeks players spend with their countries during the Six Nations, would mean the Test game took up half a season in the non-World Cup years between and Leagues in Europe are attracting the interest of private equity companies who see untapped income in commercial rights. But maximising potential would mean clubs having their leading players for longer than they do now. There does not look to be any scope for a club competition between the best in the hemispheres. The need for clubs to be involved in any change is highlighted by a reason the friendly format is failing – the drift of players from the south to the north. It may prove easier to decide what future Novembers and Julys will look like than to resolve a key question: how should the proceeds from more competitive fixtures be shared? At the moment the match hosts receive all the gate receipts, broadcasting income, commercial deals, apart from a fourth international where the visiting union receives a fee. One reason the All Blacks’ appearances in England and Wales this decade have become less frequent is because of the New Zealand union demand. The southern hemisphere nations have long lobbied for income from tier one matches, including Lions tours, to be pooled and shared out. It would raise the turnover of all four and help them retain players. However the European unions, which attract bigger crowds, have consistently refused to entertain the idea. A friendly revamp with a competitive element would resurrect the issue, especially if there were an overall title sponsor. Europe has found that its greater financial muscle has weakened the international game to the point where to carry on and change nothing would be to redden balance sheets here. England Joe Marler retires from international rugby A new tournament – and that word should be used in the loosest sense because whatever is devised will not be an all-inclusive version of the Six Nations or Rugby Championship – would offer value to backers because it had no past. The Six Nations continues to look for a new title sponsor two years after RBS gave notice. On the surface, it should be easy to sell: it is the sport most popular tournament outside the World Cup, playing to packed houses, it is on terrestrial TV and generates large audiences, it is steeped in tradition and its popularity is not defined by the quality of rugby produced. Yet, little more than four months before the start of the championship, they have still been unable to command the price they want. The uncertainty over Brexit is a factor but, as RBS found, the Six Nations, like the FA Cup, does not lend itself to a sponsor name in the title and backers expect a return. The point of the Sydney summit, and Pichot outburst this month, was to underline the primacy of international rugby, but at a period of flux it is not that simple. If there is a way out, clubs and unions have to walk along the same path, not on parallel lines. This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

23,"here is a particularly interesting episode of Revisionist History , Malcolm Gladwell often fascinating podcast, about Wilt Chamberlain game in the NBA and the importance in achieving that historic record of underhand free throws. Chamberlain was a phenomenal basketball player, but at the particular skill of free throws he was unusually weak. Indeed, only two people in the entire history of the NBA (counting only those with more than attempts – not as many as it sounds) have been worse than him. Across his career Chamberlain had a success rate – horribly bad compared with an NBA average of around and ludicrously inferior to the all-time top free-throw shooters, who average a shade over Surrey and Worcestershire bookend table but share much in between | The Spin But on the night of March Chamberlain was a master. He made of his attempts that night, an success rate, and it was not a one-off. Before that season the Philadelphia Warriors head coach, Frank McGuire, convinced Chamberlain to try throwing underhand, and across that season he made of his free throws. At its end he abandoned the experiment and went back to throwing overhand. In six of the seasons that followed he averaged less than bottoming out at in but there was no going back. The reason for his decision was simple: the underhand method is widely and pejoratively known as a “granny shot”, seen as being the lame recourse of those not skilled enough to throw properly. “I felt silly, like a sissy, shooting underhanded,” Chamberlain wrote in his autobiography. “I know I was wrong. I know some of the best foul shooters in history shot that way. I just couldn’t do it.” In my early childhood games of cricket almost every player had a go at bowling, falling into one of three groups. There were those whose only hope of vaguely threatening the stumps was to bowl underarm, the youthful prodigies who could reliably sling down vaguely accurate overarm deliveries, and the most hapless bunch of them all, those whose ability was no better than the first group but who bowled overarm anyway. These were children who, for fear of making themselves look silly, made themselves look silly. Neville Cardus, the Guardian venerable cricket writer and an advocate of underarm, or lob, bowling, addressed the issue of the style lack of credibility after the death of Sussex brilliant Walter Humphreys in “No doubt the man in the street will smile at the mere mention of lobs. ‘Grubs’, he calls them derisively,” he wrote. “But surely the success of Humphreys’ modest art, at a period great in batsmanship, cannot be dismissed with a smile of indulgence.” Humphreys also helped George Simpson-Hayward, probably the greatest “modern” lob bowler, or lobster as they became known, to hone his art. He spent three years practicing lobs before he first used them in a match, with instant success. Pelham Warner reported that when he made his England debut in South Africa in “the crowd roared with laughter when he first went on”. He took six wickets for runs. The derision with which lob bowling was met was perhaps, Cardus wrote, actually an advantage, helping to tempt batsmen out of dull defensiveness. “A batsman cannot stonewall for long against a lob bowler without feeling, down in his heart, that he is making a fool of himself,” he wrote. But there was more to lob bowling than attempting to humiliate batsmen into getting themselves out. Underarm bowling is inherently more accurate – “the quoit player does not trust an overarm action,” as Cardus notes – and allows greater and more varied spin to be applied to the ball. Plus by the lob bowling was so unusual that opponents no longer knew how best to play it. As Cardus saw it, “every county ought to encourage a likely lob bowler just because every other county doesn’t”. It is also possible to bowl underarm and at pace. David Harris was the fastest bowler of his day (though his day was in the late Century); Brighton George Brown, a tree-trunk-limbed father of who played a century later, was so quick his teams had to deploy two long stops. According to legend on one occasion they both missed the ball, which even when it reached the boundary was going so fast that it struck and instantly killed a passing dog. “We are all too apt to make of our pastimes pretty routine affairs, with too much hard professionalism spoiling the surprise and gusto which are the life and soul of sport,” Cardus opined in “Let us have back the lob then, and the batsman on his toes, the men in the outfield keen and palpitating just a little, the crowd buzzing anticipation.” A first win in England: India and the elephant will never forget | Simon Burnton The world of cricket did not heed the cry. Indeed two years later when Trevor Molony made the first of three appearances for Surrey – taking the wicket of Jack Hobbs in a trial game – the Guardian noted that “lobs are such an unfamiliar sight in these days that his efforts were watched with much interest” (according to the Cricketer on one occasion the batters’ discomfort at his bowling “evinced much laughter from the crowd”). Approaching a century later Molony remains the last specialist lob bowler to play first class cricket. “If we try to discover some explanation for the present universal neglect of lob bowling, we shall probably be right in suggesting as the first and greatest, fashion,” the Guardian wrote in “It does now require some moral courage for a boy to begin and continue bowling lobs in a society which regards them as a slightly fatuous jest.” Would a great lobster have any chance of thriving in today game? It is impossible to say, as nobody alive has ever seen one, and it is unlikely now that they ever shall. The accuracy and unpredictability of Simpson-Hayward represent a test that can only be faced in the imagination. But, and this is the crux, did it die out because it was considered inferior, or because it was considered infantile? This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian weekly cricket email.

24,"he Ryder Cup started, like so many others before them, with the formal introduction of the wives and girlfriends. They were made to dress up like Stepford Wives and march in a parade on to the stage, where they made an immaculate backdrop for the opening ceremony. They spent the next hour sitting and standing, waving and clapping. They do not even get to stand by their men but have to line up behind them. It is not really clear why the Ryder Cup feels the need to have them do this. It must be the only sporting event that makes a point of staging a parade for the players’ partners and putting out lists of “attending spouses”. It is, as they say at Augusta, a tradition like no other, and one they should have dispensed with a while back. Europe to lead off with Rose and rookie Rahm in bid for Ryder Cup greatness They do not do it at the Solheim Cup. The husbands and boyfriends are not made to troop on stage in matching shirts and blazers. But at the Ryder Cup, the wives and girlfriends – never yet a husband or boyfriend – are such an integral part of the show that the few players who show up alone say they feel pretty conspicuous about being single. Rickie Fowler was last time around but not this. The best thing about it, he said, was that this time he will “actually have someone to kiss” if his team win. Instead, Fowler said, they will all “make fun of Bryson DeChambeau”, who has come on his own. Europe singleton is Thorbjørn Olesen, who got to make a threesome with Ian and Katie Poulter when it was all over and everyone had to march off, arm-in-arm with their partners. Jim Furyk, ever-so-earnest, picked up on the theme when he filled a stretch of his speech with a long tribute to his wife Tabitha who, he said, as he stared misty-eyed into the middle distance like an army vet having a combat flashback, “loves the Ryder Cup as much as I do”. He thanked all the women “for putting up with us”. Keith Pelley, the chief executive of the European Tour, keeps talking about how he wants the game to “embrace change and modernise to appeal to a wider market”, that it needs to evolve to appeal to “the millennial demographic”. Seth Waugh, who is just starting as the chief executive of the PGA of America, says that he wants to make golf look and feel more like “our kids’ game as opposed to our parents’ game”. They might make a small step in the right direction by cutting out this all ridiculous family values carry-on from their signature competition. Golf never looks so straight or so silly as it does at the opening ceremony of the Ryder Cup. Golf never looks so straight or so silly as it does at the opening ceremony of the Ryder Cup The competition could do with a man like Tadd Fujikawa. Sadly, he is not on the USA team, or even all that close to it since he is ranked in the world. Ten years ago, he was one of the most talented teenage players in the world. In he became the youngest player ever to qualify for the US Open, when he was just The year after that, he became the youngest man in years to make the cut in a PGA event, the Sony Open in Hawaii. Since then, he has struggled because of anxiety and depression. It got so bad that he thought about quitting the sport. Until a fortnight ago, when Fujikawa decided to do something about it. He came out. On September, just after World Suicide Prevention Day, Fujikawa put up an Instagram post that started: “So … I’m gay.” Fujikawa explained he was not sure whether to do it but decided to because “I remember how much others’ stories have helped me in my darkest times to have hope. I spent way too long pretending, hiding and hating who I was. I was always afraid of what others would think or say. “I’ve struggled with my mental health for many years because of that and it put me in a really bad place. Now I’m standing up for myself and the rest of the LGBTQ community.” Fujikawa is the first, and so far only, openly gay male professional golfer in the history of the game. In a follow-up interview with GQ he explained that his depression was not just down to being closeted but it was a large part of it, “because I was so deathly afraid of stuff coming out and just not accepting myself at all”. The negative responses, he said, were the ones who asked him: “Who cares?” Because “as much as it shouldn’t matter, it does matter, because people are still struggling”. Only, so far as he knows, none of them are on the tour with him. Back in Golf Monthly asked top players whether they thought there were any gay men on tour. One of their anonymous responses was “I choose not to believe so”. Fujikawa feels so alone that he says: “I really think I am the only one. I was hoping that there would be others. It hard to tell. Golf is such an individual sport. And a lot of people really keep to themselves for the most part. Obviously, there gaydar, and mine works perfectly fine. But none that I can tell.” The Ladies Tour, of course, has had plenty of openly gay players for years. That is just another area, then, where the women are in front of the men, not stuck beside and behind them.",958,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/27/ryder-cup-2018-opening-ceremony-wives-girlfriends-tadd-fujikawa
25,"ou’ve got to hand it to Lance Armstrong – he a fighter. Sure, Tiger Woods may look like a shoo-in for this year Biggest Comeback from a Spectacular Fall from Grace by a Sporting Star of the But Armstrong isn’t giving up hope of the title just yet. Especially not when he been laying the groundwork for the past two years. Lance Armstrong: David Millar is ‘last person’ who should lead cyclists’ union His podcasts – the ultimate safe space for the celebrity who wants to work again – have gained a large following since he launched Wedū, a media company so hip it requires a macron to ensure you pronounce it properly. According to Armstrong, it was set to make during the three weeks of this year Tour de France thanks to subscription fees, merchandise and loyal sponsors such as the tequila company Patrón. That a lot of Lance-a-ritas . This week Armstrong has weighed in on the election for president of the professional cyclists’ union. Specifically, his distaste at the candidacy of David Millar, a man who was once his teammate but who committed the solecism of calling on him to come clean back when he was still getting away with it. You’d think their shared life experiences might have earned Millar a little empathy. But Armstrong has no time for his former brother-in-arms, even when those arms all had artificially high blood counts. Armstrong was outraged that Millar had the audacity to lobby for a role in the sport he contaminated. “Millar is probably the last person that would come to mind for this role,” he said. It charmingly endearing, isn’t it, to know that he can’t think of anyone who might be a worse candidate. Armstrong objections are that Millar will not provide the riders with the protection and the strong voice they deserve. Armstrong was, of course, known to be passionate about the welfare of the peloton when he was competing. Although it is perhaps a sign of how much he has grown that giving them a say has worked its way so far up his list of priorities. He wasn’t quite so keen for his colleagues or employees to be heard when they were on the brink of exposing him. But the world today is a very different one from that dark time, back in when that giant conspiracy was determined to dirty his halo. Happily, these days it is possible to rewrite and even simply ignore the unfortunate things one has said and done in the past. In fact, Armstrong understanding of how malleable truth can be is surely only to his long-term credit in today public sphere. In the era of our post-truth politics, brass neck and sheer gall are precious commodities. So perhaps when he was accusing Floyd Landis of being “desperate for attention and money”, calling his masseuse an alcoholic whore and deriding the investigation against him as an “unconstitutional witch hunt”, he was just ahead of his time. It can be no coincidence that, on the day that Armstrong finally gave up his legal defence, there was one voice warning him against it. “I never thought he was a quitter,” tweeted Donald Trump. “He should immediately reconsider or his legacy is ruined.” Let us hope it brings president Trump joy to know he was mistaken. That, six years after Armstrong lifelong ban from the sport he had disgraced, the man who determinedly cheated, lied and bullied his way to an almost successful cover-up is back in our lives with a podcast. Annemiek van Vleuten retains world time-trial title as Dutch riders dominate It was, Armstrong told his listeners in July, “super humbling” to be this popular again. “For me it was really humbling that it was almost a validation. I mean you had a show that had five million downloads in three weeks,” he added, humbly. As his own website asks: “Who believes that the most meaningful revelations emerge at the far edge of your limits – that there are flashes of self-truth in moments of suffering?” We du. Whether Armstrong has actually attained such enlightenment, only he and his buddy Oprah may ever know. It would certainly be easier to enjoy his rebranding and his range of T-shirt logos – “Sūffer”, “Soūl” and “Get Oūt” – if the contrition he offered for his past actions felt less self-absorbed. Take his recent appearance on the Freakonomics podcast , in which the interviewer congratulated him on how far he had come. And it was true, Armstrong did say he understood why people hated him and that “people had suffered this tremendous sense of betrayal”, which is almost but not quite the same thing as saying you feel ashamed that you betrayed them. He pointed out that he had tried to make amends to those he’d wronged. “This thing cost me he said. “Everybody been paid back.” He also, however, said he wouldn’t change a thing and complained he had been treated unfairly compared to Alex Rodriguez, who was allowed to return to baseball after his drugs scandal. Which brings us back to Millar. Armstrong ongoing gripe at the cycling authorities is how the big fish caught in the dopers’ net were made examples of while the small fry were “given complete passes”. One can’t help speculating that Millar own rehabilitation is part of the “hypocritical and unfair” situation Armstrong now discerns. Hypocrisy? Unfairness? How very dare they. Armstrong own return to the cycling world is surely a matter of earnest, selfless rehabilitation, a precursor to a second act that will win us all over again. As the man himself says, this thing cost him enough. He had to pass up Dancing with the Stars every year just to look sorry. Perhaps it time he headed to the jungle for I’m a Celebrity. Now that what I call rehabilitation.",978,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/26/lance-armstrong-biggest-comeback-sport-disgraced
26,"Philadelphia is home to the undisputed king of professional sports mascots: the Phillie Phanatic. No less esteemed a source than Wikipedia reveals he is “widely acknowledged as one of the best ballpark mascots” and “arguably the most recognizable mascot in all of North American sports”. You can imagine the horror, then, when he got a new sibling this week: Gritty, the Philadelphia Flyers’ new mascot, is a horrifying bearded man-Muppet hybrid whose eyes are permanently rolling in their sockets, presumably from years of drug use. He is a nightmarish frat boy who communicates only in bro-friendly gestures – the guy who was loudly present at every college party but had never experienced true friendship. He fills the hole in his heart with a violent Flyers obsession. He is toxic masculinity incarnate. And I fear, to many, he is a perfect emblem of my city. Philadelphia is known for greasing poles to minimize damage by – and to – fans after Eagles victories; we’ve been forever branded as the city that hurled snowballs at Santa Claus and where a guy purposely threw up on a cop and his child ( RIP ). The main attraction of our art museum is not Marcel Duchamp Nude Descending a Staircase but the fact that Sylvester Stallone ran up the stairs there once . Gritty, in short, is the last thing we need. The Flyers’ website describes him as being descended from a “bully” who is “unwelcoming to anyone who opposes his team”. Surely his presence will only encourage more tourists to skip over the city between New York and Washington on their east coast trips. Meanwhile, we’re raising our kids with this thing as a role model. My sister used to receive cheerful birthday cards from the Phanatic. I assume Gritty will send children half-drunk cans of Yuengling. (At least he is, inexplicably, concerned over sports-related brain trauma: he always wears a helmet.) All this comes at a terrible time for Philadelphia, with our post-victory antics on full national display after the Super Bowl victory last year. Even the sainted Phanatic has run into trouble of late: a hot dog he fired from his fabled cannon flew into a fan face and sent her to the emergency room. I’m sure he is gripped with a sense of remorse that would be completely foreign to Gritty. Why can’t we have more mascots like Swoop, the upstanding eagle who backs the Eagles? Sure, he got his tough side: his official bio reveals that he eats “smaller birds such as Cardinals, Falcons, Ravens, and Seahawks”. But that only natural, and at least he is an identifiable organism – more than can be said for Gritty. The years after jettisoning the beloved Big Shot and subsequent Hip Hop , have Franklin the Dog, a name that evokes the city rich history. The team website offers visual proof that his ancestors crossed the Delaware with George Washington. And he was designed “by kids, for kids”, rather than emerging from a fever dream in the mind of Jim Henson evil twin. I would encourage the Flyers to reconsider Gritty and select a new mascot representative of the better angels of Philadelphia nature. What about our rich cultural offerings – maybe the Thinker from the Rodin Museum would strike fear into the hearts of our rivals? Or we could go with a giant Liberty Bell whose steadfast image of freedom would drive away those who wish the Flyers ill. Hell, a walking cheesesteak would be better than Gritty. Alas, I doubt any of these powerful ideas will win over the powers that be at the Wells Fargo Center. In the meantime, we’ll just have to hope that Gritty too hungover to come to practice.",623,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/27/gritty-flyers-mascot-philadelphia-phanatic

But the Americans had Europe worried for a bit back there, huh? McIlroy v Thomas Casey A/S Koepka Rose v Simpson Rahm v Woods Fleetwood v Finau Poulter v Johnson Olesen v Spieth Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren v DeChambeau Final score: Europe USA Noren beats DeChambeau DeChambeau putt is conceded. Which leaves Noren with a to make birdie, halve the hole, and win his match. It unlikely ... but the left-to-right slider goes into the middle of the cup, and seconds later he engulfed by team-mates! As they leap about in glee, even Jordan Spieth, greenside, can’t help but laugh. That might become the defining moment of this Ryder Cup , you know. It was worth waiting for! From the centre of the fairway, DeChambeau pitches his second to inches! That one of the shots of the entire week! That a birdie, and chances are he’ll be getting a half point, because Noren miles from the pin in two. Updated at BST They’re going down the last. Of course they are. DeChambeau needs to win the hole if he to avoid the fate of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, and end the week without making any contribution at all to the USA total. Noren v DeChambeau EUROPE USA Rory speaks! “It incredible. We took a tough loss at Hazeltine a couple of years ago, and that stung, it was my first experience of what it like to be on the other side. None of us want to fee like that on a Sunday afternoon. The players have been great, the rookies have been phenomenal. We’ve stuck to our job. One of the great things is, we’ve all contributed points. Jon Rahm got a point today, Thorbjorn got a point today, I’m delighted for them. And it validates what Thomas has wanted to do. It a culmination of two years’ hard work. He been incredible, in constant contact with all the guys who were in the team and on the periphery. It been a love-in for the last week. One of the great things about Ryder Cups is that you forge friendships that last a lifetime. And I think a few of those friendships have been forged this week.” DeChambeau not smiling any longer when he sends his tee shot at into the water. But he wedges close from the drop zone, and makes the bogey putt. Noren can’t make his par, and there a fair chance this’ll end up going down Think of it as bonus golf. Everyone loves bonus golf. Noren v DeChambeau EUROPE USA A sad but sporting Jim Furyk speaks. And some very classy words too. “I’m proud of these guys, they fought. There was a time when it looked as though we had a chance. We put some heat on Europe in the first five or six matches. We scrapped it out. But hats off to Europe, they played well again. They turned it around, and looks as though they’ll win the session. So hats off to Thomas, he was a great captain, and his team members played very well top to bottom. So congratulations to them. We’ll regroup and move forward. I’m really proud, I love these guys, I’m proud to serve as their captain, and I had five of my closest friends as vice-captains. It was a group effort. You just have to tip your cap, we got outplayed and Thomas was the better captain.” There still one match out on the course. Nobody cares too much about it. Noren just wants to join in the celebrations; a grinning DeChambeau has taken to conducting the crowd as they sing about Sergio. Noren v DeChambeau EUROPE USA Updated at BST EUROPE USA Reed beats Hatton Captain America secures a consolation point for the Americans with birdie on after a lovely tee shot to three feet. He spins round and shushes the crowd, before breaking into a wide smile, applauding the gallery and congratulating Hatton on Europe victory. That was a lovely self-deprecating joke from the Masters champion. Here the snap take on Europe victory! Ryder Cup Masterful Europe sweep to victory over USA Sergio, Europe all-time number-one Ryder Cup scorer, speaks! “I don’t usually cry but today I can’t help it. It been a rough year. So thankful for Thomas to pick me and believe in me. I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back. It about the team., and I’m happy I was able to help. It was one of those years when nothing seemed to happen. But I’ve never had so many big cheers as I’ve had this week. They had a hell of a team, but it shows how good we are too.” Europe USA Sergio beats Fowler The pair share in par ... and the resulting point means Sergio Garcia has won more points than anybody else in Ryder Cup history! His haul of beats Sir Nick Faldo by ½. Updated at BST Europe USA Stenson beats Watson He closes out his match, halving in birdie. He congratulated by Bubba and Webb Simpson, and then is handed a cup of rosé champagne. He deserves to drain that, but he can’t because someone sprays him in the face with another bottle! Marvellous scenes! Now ... you can say that someone sending a shot into water is a bit anti-climactic compared to a winning putt. And you may have a point. But consider: Molinari registered the winning point ... and in doing so, becomes the first European in Ryder Cup history to win five out of five points! He shakes off the sticky booze and speaks: “This means so much more than majors. It hard not to get emotional, it been an incredible week. They had the strongest team ever, it so good!” Updated at BST EUROPE WIN THE RYDER CUP!!! Europe USA Molinari sends his tee shot at pin high, feet away. Mickelson, the USA on the edge, dunks his tee shot in the water! And he offers his hand to Molinari, who wins the match He immediately drowned in champagne. What an end to the year for the Open champion! Updated at BST Europe will win the Ryder Cup! Nothing official yet, because the matches have to be completed before the points are registered. But they only need one more point. And Molinari-Mickelson is dormie three, Stenson-Watson is dormie five, and Sergio has just won after Fowler found more water; he dormie two. It done, but not yet dusted. Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren v DeChambeau EUROPE USA Europe USA Poulter beats Johnson Johnson nearly drains his long birdie putt, but it shaves by the hole, and Dustin doesn’t want to see Poulter putt. He shakes the Ryder Cup living legend hand, and the Postman delivers a precious point. Europe are on the brink of reclaiming the Ryder Cup! Updated at BST Sergio can’t make his putt. Hole to Fowler, who sliced into water off the tee. What a business. Oh Sergio! Meanwhile DJ wedge into only just makes it over the water. He got an uphill putt over a ridge from feet. Poulter meanwhile eases a stunning wedge to feet. The grandstand at erupts accordingly. And on Bubba makes a street-fighting par, but it a half, and Stenson is dormie five. Poulter v Johnson Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren A/S DeChambeau EUROPE USA Fowler drops by the water at and sends his third not particularly close. Sergio sends his fourth to feet from the drop zone. Rickie nearly drains his long par putt; the pressure, ludicrously, is on Sergio to make a putt to salvage a half. Meanwhile Stenson is on in two, with Bubba in a little trouble. What this, though? Fowler had found water off the tee at ... and now Sergio sends a weak approach into the briny, letting his opponent back into the hole, and maybe the match. Oh Sergio! That is absurd ! Speaking of absurd ... Poulter outdrives DJ on Both in prime position though. Nope! The tension gets to the very best of them. Poulter short one horseshoes out. They’ll go up though at least Poulter can’t lose. Meanwhile Bubba is in awful trouble all the way up handing yet another hole to Stenson; Hatton birdies to cut Reed lead to two holes; and Molinari birdies the par-five to move three up on Mickelson, whose brief mid-round revival looks to have been for nothing. Poulter v Johnson Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren A/S DeChambeau EUROPE USA DJ pulls his lob wedge out. He also removes the flagstick. But his dinky little chip is never likely to drop. It slips to the right, and that a par. Which leaves Poulter with a putt to win the match from seven feet. He prowls around it awhile. Is the Postman about to deliver yet another point? It beginning to slip away from the USA. Fowler sends his tee shot at into the drink down the right. He really up against it now, with the noggin gone. Can DJ pull something out of the bag at Spanish players and the Ryder Cup , eh? Rahm allows himself a tear of joy; his victory means every single European has contributed a point. Nothing for poor old Tiger. What a difference a week makes. Meanwhile on DJ sends his drive into the thick rough. He can only send his second through the back, unable to get any control. Poulter is on in two, with a decent birdie opportunity. And a hole won by Sergio ... or rather lost by Fowler, who hacked his way up Whisper it, but it beginning to look a whole lot better for Europe now. They just need two points to reclaim the cup, and they’re up in four matches and level in another. Poulter v Johnson Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren A/S DeChambeau EUROPE USA Updated at BST Europe USA Rahm beats Woods Tiger nearly trundles in a chip from off the front of the green, but DJ just used up the USA miracle. It flies four feet past, and Rahm makes his birdie putt to seal the deal! What an amazing hole of golf he just played: a monster drive, a delicious chip, and a firm putt into the centre of the cup! And all that after a miserable short one missed on the previous green! Oh this is totally outrageous by Dustin Johnson! Having conceded the to go two down, he left himself a for birdie on the par-three And for the second time today, he drained a monster! Poulter must wonder what on earth is going on! He now left with a for a half ... and he leaves it out left. Just the one hole in that again! Rahm v Woods Poulter v Johnson Garcia v Fowler Molinari v Mickelson Hatton v Reed Stenson v Watson Noren A/S DeChambeau EUROPE USA Tiger drive at flies into the deep stuff down the left. Rahm blooters a massive, tee shot down the middle ... and it could be enough to close out this game, because while Tiger can only smash out of the rough towards the front of the green, Rahm is able to wedge pin high to six feet!

28,"Kurtley Beale has done his best to recover from a first-minute brain explosion, but it wasn’t enough to stem the bleeding as the struggling Wallabies fell to the Springboks in Port Elizabeth. Things couldn’t have started worse for the visitors after Beale ambitious pass was intercepted in the second and South Africa quickly jumped to a lead on Saturday night. Australia did well to recover and threw a bulk of the late punches as they controlled per cent of possession in the second half. Try and try again: Japan Rugby World Cup But, like a fortnight ago in the Gold Coast loss to Argentina, they lacked the polish needed to exploit it and eventually ran out of gas in the face of incredible cover defence. It marked their sixth loss from eight Tests this year and adds further pressure on coach Michael Cheika and his squad less than months out from the World Cup. Beale bewildering speculator looked destined for nobody other than Springboks winger Aphiwe Dyantyi, who caught the floating pass just metres from the tryline for a gift five-pointer. It set the tone for a manic opening minutes in front of nearly boisterous fans at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium before they rallied to head to the sheds only down. “I thought he came back from that pretty well really,” the coach said of his No “That would’ve spooked him a bit, but I thought the rest of his game was pretty solid. “It was two tries all – we basically gave one away and then we had a lot of good footy – but you’ve got to capitalise on your moments don’t you.” David Pocock was arguably Australia best with three clean steals in the first minutes, steadying the side before Will Genia manufactured some points. First the scrumhalf cut out two men in a perfect assist for Reece Hodge in the corner. Then he finished a five-pointer created by fullback Dane Haylett-Petty bust and offload to make it in the minute. World Rugby Sydney committee meetings will struggle to resolve anything | Paul Rees Earlier Faf de Klerk slid through after Handre Pollard broke Folau Fainga’a tackle to make it in the minute. Rassie Erasmus side backed up well from their defeat of the All Blacks a fortnight ago, making nearly double the tackles of Australia and continually shutting down the visitor expansive forays. But he was equally critical of his side efficiency, cheekily suggesting it could have been far uglier for the visitors. “We didn’t play tactically well, but the guts the boys showed, the character again was great,” South African coach Rassie Erasmus said. “We definitely created a hell of a lot of opportunities; I thought if we scored (from them) we could’ve given them a good, good hiding.” The Wallabies now head straight to Argentina, where they play Los Pumas next weekend in Salta.

29,"It may be too early in the season to describe Sunday meeting of Leicester and Sale at Welford Road as an eight-pointer but with the Manchester club starting the fifth round at the bottom of the Premiership and the Tigers having the worst defensive record after the opening four rounds, there will be little comfort for the loser in a season when, without an obvious struggler, every point counts. “We are not looking at the table,” insists the Sale captain, Jono Ross. “There are still games to play. We have not had the start we wanted in the toughest of leagues because we have not been good enough. We have to improve and that starts with hard work. It is far too early to be talking about relegation and all we are focusing on is Leicester .” Stuart Hooper to replace Todd Blackadder at Bath in While the shape of the domestic season from is expected to be announced in the next couple of weeks after prolonged discussions between the Rugby Football Union, Premiership Rugby and the Professional Rugby Players’ Association, relegation will remain despite talk of ringfencing the elite. The only possible reprieve for the team finishing bottom will be if the Championship winners do not meet the entry criteria. With promoted Bristol winning two of their first four matches and Worcester, the pre-season relegation favourites, triumphant at Leicester having been pipped by a point by Wasps in the opening round, the comfort blanket of a team detached from the rest from early in the campaign has been snatched away. The bottom three clubs going into the latest round of matches were all former champions, Sale , Northampton and Newcastle. Two others, Leicester and Harlequins, were higher up the table, after one victory each in four, because of bonus points. The prospect of a big-name casualty – the last was Northampton in – is real. “There are no weak teams in the Premiership,” says Ross. “You look at Leicester squad and it is full of quality. It is the same with us but it is all about putting in a performance. We have played well in parts in all of our four games but we have not put it together for minutes. We have been falling away and that has to stop.” Sydney summit feels like a pivotal moment in rugby modern history | Robert Kitson Leicester sacked their head coach, Matt O’Connor, three days into the season after losing at Exeter while Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond, reacted to their first home defeat by Wasps for eight years last weekend by recruiting the former Northampton forwards coach Dorian West and pledging some old-school training. “There was a fair bit of work done,” says Ross, who had given his side the ideal start against Wasps with a first-minute try. “Everyone was disappointed by the result and we have been taking a hard look at ourselves in the mirror. Dorian will add to our forward game and his experience should help us find an edge there.” There should be tries at Welford Road. Leicester have conceded this season, while Sale have the next leakiest defence, having been breached times. “At this stage of the season a lot can change quickly,” says Ross. “A couple of wins and you are in the top half of the table. We have to stay positive. It will be tough on Sunday but that is the case every time you play in the Premiership.”",580,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/jono-ross-sale-captain-too-early-to-talk-about-relegation
30,"A late Lima Sopoaga penalty snatched a victory for Wasps at Kingston Park. The Falcons led at half time and then when Johnny Williams grabbed his second try, but a scorching score from Juan de Jongh converted by Sopoaga made it and the Wasps fly-half then landed a crucial penalty with eight minutes left for Wasps to clinch the points. In a climactic finish Newcastle ran the ball back out when Sopoaga missed another shot with seconds on the clock and they went through phases and six minutes of overtime before their brave attempt to save the game foundered. Simon Hammersley, Toby Flood and Vereniki Goneva all made early breaks and it needed a very good tackle from Sopoaga to halt the Falcons full-back but Wasps got on scoreboard first with a try. Controversial Leicester red card spoils eight-try classic as Wasps prevail Sopoaga missed a long-range penalty but his clever kick through set up a try for Josh Bassett which the referee, Karl Dickson, initially ruled out but then awarded after he checked with the TMO, Sean Davey. It looked as if Hammersley tackle had driven Bassett over the dead ball line but replays showed the winger had got the ball down in time to make it Sopoaga missing the conversion. Newcastle hit back five minutes later with Sinoti Sinoti pinballing off defenders from Hammersley pass before finding Mark Wilson and the England forward rumbled in for his fourth try of the season. Flood tried a quick drop-goal attempt for the conversion – he missed it – which indicated there may have been some doubt about the try. Sopoaga did the same when Michael le Bourgeois appeared to have scored in the minute under the posts but Dickson stepped in, asked for the TMO who ruled there had been a knock-on and Wasps had to be satisfied with a penalty from Sopoaga for offside. Davey was called on again on the half-hour when Newcastle went to the corner three times with penalties and Johnny Williams eventually forced his way over. On review Davey awarded the try and Flood converted and then kicked a penalty for offside to make it but Newcastle comprehensively failed to handle the restart, Wasps camping on the Falcons line, and from the resulting scrum Sopoaga threw an outrageous one-handed overhead pass for Marcus Watson to score in the corner against his former club to make it at the break. Santiago Cordero: ‘England should worry. Argentina are getting better and better’ A massive run from Gary Graham was carried on by Sinoti who was hauled down close to the line and Williams snapped it up to go in – again after the TMO was called in – and Flood converted for in the minute. It seemed Tom Penny had scored after Adam Brocklebank broke through and Goneva inside pass led to a touchdown but the TMO was involved again and it showed Penny was in touch. It was something of a turning point with Wasps dominating the possession which followed and a couple of breathtaking moves had the Falcons scramble defence stretched and eventually broken when De Jongh scorched over and Sopoaga conversion made it in the minute. The Wasps fly-half then kicked the penalty from metres when Newcastle started offside to put his side ahead and Wasps held on in a frantic finish.",558,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/28/newcastle-wasps-premiership-match-report
31,"t is Santiago Cordero own choice but a life in rugby exile can be testing. On Saturday the could have been running out against the All Blacks in Buenos Aires, facing the haka and standing shoulder to shoulder with his best mates for the national anthems. Instead he will be in distant Devon, plying his trade for Exeter Chiefs against Worcester at Sandy Park before heading home to watch his beloved Pumas from his sofa. Across Europe there are around players who, were they not based abroad, would be strong contenders for Argentina squad. Juan Imhoff at Racing Juan Figallo at Saracens, Facundo Isa at Toulon: as with Cordero, these are not modest journeymen but major talents. All are now looking on from afar, unable to do more than cheer the Pumas’ recent wins over South Africa and Australia and the team highly encouraging performance in defeat to New Zealand in Nelson. The big question is what happens next. The Pumas have a new head coach in Mario Ledesma and cracks are already discernible in the “home-based only” policy introduced to try to keep Argentina better players at home. Two overseas-based players – Figallo and Stade Français Ramiro Herrera – have already been selected for Rugby Championship duty and, a year out from the World Cup, there is a good case for whistling up a few more for this November internationals. Alex Cuthbert first try helps Exeter overcome Sale for best start Cordero is realistic enough to know the odds remain lengthy: Argentina back three have been playing well and his prospects of featuring in the World Cup in Japan remain slim. It does not stop him dreaming, or predicting that England will face a horribly tough pool encounter with the Pumas in Tokyo next year. “England should be worried,” he stresses. “Argentina have improved a lot in the past few months and the boys are getting better and better. I think the next World Cup will be amazing for Argentina.” If Cordero increasing impact at upwardly-mobile Exeter is any guide, the Pumas should consider giving him a call. His wonderfully quick feet have yielded two tries in his last three games and earned him a first Premiership start at this weekend, a far cry from his chastening first week at the club last January. “It was degrees in Argentina when I left. I came here and it was zero degrees. My hands were freezing; when I went to catch the ball in training I couldn’t do it. Every touch I had was a knock-on.” There was some more juvenile team-room sniggering this week when Cordero, not yet entirely fluent in English dressing-room speak, announced at the review of last Friday win at Newcastle that he “wanted to touch more balls”. Even when “Santi” says nothing some of his teammates make fun of his habit of drinking maté (a type of South American tea) at every possible opportunity. “They think I’m weird, I think they’re weird. The only one who drinks maté with me is [Italian international] Michele Campagnaro. We have a good chemistry. I’m trying to get all the boys to try it. Maybe they’ll like my culture!” On the field, happily, there is now greater empathy with the capped Puma. The Chiefs’ structured system does not always suit spur-of-the-moment individualism but Cordero now knows where he needs to be to have a greater impact. “I’m now understanding the way they think here. Everyone, from props to full-backs, knows where we’re going. Latin players are not so structured. I just want to catch the ball and find a way through. If a gap opens, just go for it. But it good for me … I’m expanding my mind. Super Rugby is very dynamic but they study more here. You need to be alert all the time, you can’t rest. Maybe last season because I was new I felt like they didn’t trust me Now I’m gaining in confidence and I can see their trust in me growing. I’ve only been here a few months but I already feel like one of them.” Given the rapid recent depreciation of the peso against the dollar and Argentina rampant inflation, which is expected to top this year, it grows ever harder to argue that players should be frozen out for heading abroad. Cordero father works in a bank and his mother drives a school bus: having married his wife, Bernadita, in June – his best man was the Puma winger Ramiro Moyano – he would like his European rugby adventure to continue. “Every rugby player wants to play for his country but it been a good decision. I would like to find a club where I can settle down, play regularly and be part of it. Hopefully it will be here.” Whether Exeter will extend his current one-year deal if European-based Pumas are ushered back into the World Cup picture remains to be seen. For now all Cordero can do is focus on his day job and see where it takes him. “I don’t think Argentina are going to call me but if there some miracle and they do I’ll always give for my country. Every time you watch the Pumas you want to be there. For me that would be amazing. But it part of life. My first responsibility is to give everything to the Chiefs. My head is here and I’m enjoying every single moment.”",905,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/28/santiago-cordero-exeter-chiefs
32,"The former Bath captain Stuart Hooper has been earmarked to replace Todd Blackadder as their director of rugby but not until at the earliest after the club confirmed the New Zealander contract extension. Bath moved to end speculation over Blackadder future by announcing in an open letter to supporters that he will remain as the director of rugby until at least the end of next season. When he goes, the plan is for the Hooper to replace him but the club chief executive, Tarquin McDonald, revealed Blackadder may yet extend his stay further. In a detailed outline of Bath future, McDonald also announced the long-serving first-team coaches Toby Booth and Darren Edwards will be leaving at the end of the season. Hooper scheduled step up, however, is part of the club strategy of seeking to promote from within. After serving as Bath captain for five seasons he retired two years ago with a back injury before taking on the role of performance and player development director. This season he has been promoted to general manager. McDonald said: “Why Stuart Hooper? Outstanding leadership qualities, tremendous integrity yet also the willingness to be challenged, an unbelievable work ethic, a strategic mindset and the ability to get the best out of people.” World Rugby Sydney committee meetings will struggle to resolve anything | Paul Rees Meanwhile Bath have followed Wasps’ lead and left Joe Cokanasiga and Zach Mercer out of their side to face Saracens on Saturday. The pair returned from the England training camp in Bristol on Tuesday but, after Wasps named Elliot Daly, Dan Robson and Nathan Hughes on the bench for Friday match at Newcastle, Cokanasiga and Mercer miss out completely among changes. Saracens on the other hand had nine of their players away with England but eight start, including Billy Vunipola, who missed last Sunday emphatic win over Gloucester because of a pre-arranged medical procedure. Elsewhere, Harlequins welcome back Mike Brown, who has been out with a wrist injury since the opening weekend of the season, as well as the co-captain James Horwill, as they travel to Gloucester on a run of three consecutive defeats. Joe Marler also starts, having announced his international retirement this week. “We are a couple of per cent off here or there which can sometimes feel like a million miles off but after forensically reviewing our performances we can see the growth we are beginning to make,” the Harlequins head of rugby, Paul Gustard, said.

33,"Joe Marler has dropped a bombshell by retiring from England duty less than months before the World Cup. The Harlequins prop has cited spending time with his young family as a key reason, stating he is unable to give all of himself to the England cause. The who has won caps, informed Eddie Jones of his intentions shortly before the England squad camp in Bristol this week before pulling out because of personal reasons and has played his last match for the national team. RFU ‘perplexed’ at Agustín Pichot attempts to reform rugby calendar “It is an incredible commitment to play rugby for England and I strongly believe that if you are unable to give yourself fully to it then it is time to step away,” he said. “Otherwise it would not be fair on the team, or my family. Being with England you have to spend an incredible amount of time away and I could not do that any more.” Marler missed Jones first summer tour in charge of England – to Australia in – and later said he withdrew because of physical and mental exhaustion. He explained that he had been struggling to focus on his game after his fine from World Rugby for his “Gipsy Boy” comment made to the Wales prop Samson Lee . “Whenever you play for England you have to be and unfortunately I’m not in that place,” he said at the time. “I would be letting my teammates and country down if I were to tour.” His decision to withdraw from England duty permanently is a blow for Jones, considering Marler experience and his reliability in providing back-up to Mako Vunipola. Marler has made appearances under the Australian and was part of the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of New Zealand in “Now is the time to walk away and get some new blood in the team. And I am looking forward to being able to give my wife and children more of my time,” he said. “I will always be grateful for the memories playing for my country has given me.” In the short term, Jones loosehead options for the autumn internationals behind Vunipola are severely limited with Leicester Ellis Genge out with a shoulder injury. Alec Hepburn is another while his uncapped Exeter teammate Ben Moon was called into this week squad to replace Marler. Jones said: “Joe is a great player and team member so I am disappointed and we will miss him. But he has made his decision on personal grounds and we understand his reasoning. He a good guy – an honest, mature person who understands the demands of the game and the demands of family life. I have got to admire his honesty and the way he has gone about this.” Marler has been among the more vocal senior internationals to discuss the increasing demands on modern players and in April addressing plans to trim the duration of the Six Nations to six weeks, he told the Guardian : “If we lost a rest week – I think it ridiculous. If boys are playing months and getting a four- or five‑week break their bodies, and mentally… it not that you’re bored but it like: ‘Christ, this is a slog now.’” During the Six Nations this year he was banned for England first two matches against Italy and Wales and talked of knuckling down because “I’m missing out on things I really want to be part of”. He has since had a change of heart and, like his fellow loosehead Alex Corbisiero, his England career comes to a premature end. Hartley heartened by Cook chat Tiger Woods comeback may have grabbed more headlines but Dylan Hartley is trying his best to ensure a similar happy ending. With less than a year until the Rugby World Cup, England fit-again captain is determined to go to Japan as his country first-choice hooker and to make a significant Test return this autumn. Warren Gatland wants to go out on a high with Wales over next months Hartley has not played for England since mid-March, having taken an extended break to recover fully from concussion, and missed the summer tour series defeat in South Africa. He is now back playing club rugby again and a recent chat with the cricketer Alastair Cook, a Northampton Saints follower, has persuaded him there is still more he can achieve. The pair have spoken following Cook remarkable farewell performance against India at the Oval and it would appear Hartley has been suitably inspired. “I talked to him the other day,” the said. “Not about retirement, although naturally the conversation did head that way about him. Some of the things he said to me made me think I’m still in a good place professionally and with sport.” Hartley took nothing for granted at England training camp in Bristol this week. His team first autumn Test against the Springboks at Twickenham is barely five weeks away and the World Cup clock is starting to tick loudly. He believes his concussion problems are history. “I had six months between games and the advice, the research and the feeling I had was fine. A new perspective is always good. I’ve still got the desire to be involved in something good.” Robert Kitson",882,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/26/joe-marler-england-retires-internationa-rugby
34,"Warren Gatland may be entering the final year of his contract with Wales but he is determined to go out at the very top and believes his side are contenders to win the World Cup next year. Gatland, a normally inscrutable New Zealander, became emotional when asked how much it would mean to him to leave Wales on a high. In the years of professionalism before he took over as head coach at the end of Wales record had largely been poor, the grand slam standing out among a catalogue of record defeats, but under him they have enjoyed their most successful period since the Interview: Warren Gatland “There is a certain amount of pressure,” said Gatland, who has led Wales to three Six Nations titles as well as a World Cup semi-final in . “The last thing I want is for Wales to have a poor Six Nations and World Cup because we have put in a huge amount of work in the last years. “I’m bricking myself about the next year because I want it to be a good one. I am focused on doing the best job I can having loved my period in Wales. It is time to move on and I want to leave these shores with my head held high. That makes the next months pretty important, not so much November and next summer warm-ups but the Six Nations and the World Cup, the competitions we are judged on.” Gatland is the longest-serving coach in Wales history – most of his predecessors tended to be fired before a World Cup campaign – but he does not believe he would have survived so long had he not taken year-long sabbaticals to prepare the British &amp; Irish Lions for their and tours. “That time away was good for me and it refreshed me,” he said. “If I had not had that change of environment, I do not think I would have been here for as long. I think our record in the Six Nations and win-loss ratio has been pretty outstanding from a Wales perspective and the way we have performed in World Cups has been admirable. We would like to have done a bit better against the southern hemisphere teams. “It has been a challenge in the past with players coming into camp from regions who had not done as well as we would have liked, but the relationship between the Welsh Rugby Union and the regions is positive, which is pleasing from a rugby perspective. “I think it will be an open World Cup. The All Blacks are a level ahead but there is not much between the other teams and we have more strength in depth than we did in",457,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/26/warren-gatland-high-wales-rugby-12-months-world-cup-2019

The veteran British &amp; Irish Lions prop was due to join Eddie Jones squad on Sunday but pulled out that afternoon and has instead trained with his club. Although declining to expand on the reason for his absence from England the Quins’ head of rugby, Paul Gustard, revealed that he would be involved in the Premiership trip to Kingsholm this weekend. “Joe made a decision [on missing the England camp]. He available for selection for us this weekend,” Gustard said. RFU ‘perplexed’ at Agustín Pichot attempts to reform rugby calendar Meanwhile, England could yet need the Danny Cipriani “X-factor” talent and have not yet ruled the fly-half out of World Cup contention, according to the squad attack coach Scott Wisemantel. The Australian believes England will not beat teams such as New Zealand without some midfield craft and says Cipriani has not been written out of the script for The Gloucester fly-half was not invited to England training camp in Bristol but the management insist they have not lost faith in the playmaker. “Danny is still in the mix,” Wisemantel said. “He not here but we only needed two fly-halves as it a short camp. By no means is Danny scrapped. “The guy has got X-factor, he got talent. There no doubt about it. Teams [such as New Zealand] are going to score points so you have to match it. Penalties probably ain’t going to stack up when they score three tries. John Mitchell as defence coach may debate that, saying maybe we’ll only concede one which would be fantastic, but you do have to look to score tries against them.” One of Wisemantel tasks will be to improve England midfield strike threat, regardless of whether Owen Farrell, George Ford or Cipriani wears the No jersey. “It doesn’t matter who there at and you need to have the basic skills. You have to be able to catch and pass, otherwise you become a very predictable rugby team and you get picked off. England Eddie Jones defends dropping ‘superman’ Danny Cipriani “We are training the guys up in multiple positions so that they are interchangeable. If you put all your eggs in one basket at this stage, you only need one or two injuries and you are in a bit of strife. It is also about getting the basics right: the simple early catch, the ability to put the ball into space, the ability to run lines. There is not a lot of trickery in what the All Blacks do. They just do the basics really well and they do it consistently.” Wisemantel is keen to stick with England through the World Cup – “It would be a fantastic opportunity” – but not all the contractual details have been finalised. “England are one of the teams that have the chance to win a World Cup. They’re serious about their work, they’re diligent and they’re good guys. You also look at the players who didn’t come on tour to South Africa in June and what you see in the Premiership now.

36,"The Rugby Football Union is “perplexed” at moves from World Rugby vice-chairman, Agustín Pichot, to drastically reform the international calendar by introducing a World League from onwards. Pichot proposal – in which the world top teams would compete in an annual tournament switched between hemispheres every November – is set to be discussed as the World Rugby Council meets in Sydney this week. Sydney summit feels like a pivotal moment in rugby modern history | Robert Kitson The RFU would oppose the idea on the basis that the autumn international series is a huge source of revenue – it is estimated each match at Twickenham generates up to But the union is also frustrated because international windows in July and November from onwards were the cornerstone of an agreement reached by World Rugby in San Francisco last January. Along with Premiership Rugby (PRL) and the Rugby Players’ Association (RPA), the RFU is close to announcing how the domestic season in England fits into the global calendar as agreed in San Francisco. An RFU spokesperson told the Guardian: “We are a bit perplexed at these apparent developments and ideas which we have not been party to. We have worked really hard with our stakeholders PRL and RPA to define the new domestic season and we are working to the principles agreed with World Rugby which we have been assured are still valid.” Pichot explained this month that significant change was required to the global calendar to avoid international rugby “ruin”, claiming that the current model “is not working ”. The global structure hammered out in San Francisco is due to run until and while it was at the time heralded as a historic agreement, Pichot claimed it only goes of the way to resolving the international game problems. He also criticised Premiership Rugby for attempting to extend its season from September until June after the San Francisco agreement. ‘White noise’: RFU banks on new England shirt providing spark It is understood the RFU lodged a complaint with World Rugby over Pichot comments and received assurances from the global governing body chairman Bill Beaumont. Since then details of Pichot plans – as well as reported meetings with executives from the New Zealand, South Africa and French unions – have emerged. The RFU expects discussions on the global calendar in Sydney to centre on how commercial revenues from the international game can be increased based on the San Francisco agreement. But privately there is a degree of concern Pichot is gathering support from other unions behind the scenes.",425,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/25/rfu-perplexed-agustin-pichot-reform-rugby-calendar
37,"ot for the first time the world of international rugby union is holding its breath. As outlined to the Guardian a fortnight ago , World Rugby vice-chairman Agustín Pichot believes significant change is required for the global game to flourish financially and his proposed solution will be debated in Sydney this Wednesday . Should he gain sufficient support, it will spell the end of the traditional matrix of June and November tour fixtures. Pichot and his supporters want to see a new “World League” run along similar lines to European football new Nations League, rather than the current succession of (so-called) “friendlies”. The top sides in the world rankings would be split into pools potentially hosted in alternate years by the northern and southern hemispheres, with three pool games for each team, followed by semi-finals and a final. Five huge weekends in total, with shared television rights, would lend an extra “edge” (to use Pichot word) to some previously mundane fixtures. RFU ‘frustrated and perplexed’ at Agustín Pichot attempts to reform rugby calendar Would it benefit the game? From a purely rugby perspective the answer is potentially yes. The current June and November Tests tend to involve at least one team staggering towards the end of a long season: by unifying the “windows” into one block, it would help to level the playing field. There would also be a collective narrative for everyone else to follow, replacing the “here today gone tomorrow” disposability of one-off autumn Tests. Rather than undermining the Rugby World Cup, it might just achieve the opposite and whet the public appetite to a greater extent. Less is frequently more in top-level sport. In terms of revenue sharing, it might also help the have-nots. Current international attendances in the southern hemisphere are sliding and there will be certain subscription-based television companies interested in the potential of a fresh full-on tournament with worldwide appeal. Good luck, though, with convincing Premiership Rugby or the Rugby Football Union that this constitutes progress. The English clubs have assorted plans of their own, none of which involve obediently picking up crumbs from the major unions’ schedules. The RFU makes so many millions from big Twickenham occasions that reducing the number of said paydays would involve an entire farmyard of self-interested turkeys voting for Christmas. As Pichot stressed this month, however, rugby can no longer afford selfishness and old-school thinking if it wishes to maximise its full potential. The Six Nations and Rugby Championship competitions would remain intact but a new, streamlined proposition would join them. Assuming a satisfactory revenue-sharing model can be agreed, it would generate more cash for World Rugby collective coffers and help emerging nations to emerge a bit quicker. Tonga, Fiji, Japan and others would no longer be fobbed off with the occasional Test abroad. They would be an integral part of the show. This, in turn, would galvanise the nations ranked and below; presumably there would also be regional shoot-outs with the winners earning sufficient ranking points to break into the top dozen – or qualify for a play-off – the following year. It might also help players welfare-wise: international players would play fewer Tests overall but the commercial spin-offs could be substantial. Assuming room in the calendar is retained for a British and Irish Lions tour every four years, Pichot initiative merits serious consideration, notwithstanding the San Francisco compromise agreement to which all the stakeholders signed up last year. The International Rugby Players’ Association chief executive, Omar Hassanein, is among those who believe the players deserve a much better-structured season: “I think Gus comments were very relevant. More money shouldn’t mean more games and shorter rest periods. In order to get the optimum out of these players, we feel they need to be playing less anyway. “We want to ensure that pressures are not put on players to prioritise club over country. As more money gets poured into the club game, that sometimes comes with a perceived entitlement to control the player more. Whilst we understand the club is the paymaster, we think everyone needs to row in behind the fact that the international game should always be the pinnacle.” Hassanein, by the sound of it, entirely agrees with Pichot that Test rugby is coming under genuine threat. “We don’t want the sport to go to a place where the club game is so appealing that players gravitate more and more towards it and start finding reasons not to play in big internationals. Players are very proud of their nations but the game has got to tackle this head on. We need to be very careful that the sport doesn’t get steered towards a club-driven game.” Wednesday gathering in Sydney feels like an increasingly pivotal moment in the game modern history. Fight to the finish One glance at the Gallagher Premiership table tells its own stark story. After four rounds only Saracens and Exeter are still unbeaten while the bottom seven clubs – Harlequins, Leicester, Bristol, Worcester, Newcastle, Northampton and Sale – are separated by only five points. As previously observed in these columns, neither Bristol nor Worcester will be going quietly, if at all. Newcastle and Northampton possess too many good players to be cut adrift, which leaves Harlequins, Leicester and the current basement dwellers Sale, all three Premiership champions in the not too distant past. The annual game of relegation musical chairs has never been more cut-throat.",902,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/25/sydney-rugby-agustin-pichot
38,"Warren Gatland has not abandoned hope of being able to select his Lions scrum-half Rhys Webb for the World Cup next year. Under an agreement between the Welsh Rugby Union and its four regions, the Webb is an outcast at international level after turning down the opportunity to remain in Wales and joining Toulon in the summer. Webb half-back partner at Ospreys last season, Dan Biggar, is available to the Wales head coach, Gatland, despite joining Northampton because he meets the threshold of caps for players who have turned down a regional contract and moved abroad. Rugby union power rankings: All Blacks still despite rare defeat | Gerard Meagher “I feel very sorry for Rhys,” said Gatland, who is in the final year of his contract with Wales having started at the end of “I would love the opportunity to be able to pick him but the rules say I can’t. I would like to think that, if we have injuries at scrum-half, common sense will prevail. “The pleasing thing is that the rugby management board, which includes the four head coaches of the regions, meets once a month. They understand what the position is and I don’t think anyone wants a see a team hampered by not being able to pick the best player. “We will see what happens over the next six months. If Rhys form is good enough and seeing what happens with the other scrum-halves, is there a possibility? At the moment it is a firm no but you can never say never. “There is no doubt that when Rhys is fit and playing well, he is world-class. We will let the dust settle on it and, when we get a bit closer to the World Cup, it might be a possibility. It could make a difference to us, having someone like him available.” Webb, who missed Toulon weekend victory against Agen because of injury, hopes dispensation can be made. “I have not given up on the dream of representing my country again,” he said. “I just want to play as well as I can and become the best number nine in the world, so it will be hard not to pick me.”",367,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/24/warren-gatland-rhys-web-wales
39,"England new defence coach, John Mitchell, thinks Eddie Jones squad can still win the Rugby World Cup despite their disappointing results this year. The former All Blacks head coach has been recruited by Jones to add fresh impetus to the team following a run of five defeats in the past six Tests. “I really believe we can get better and be the best within a year time,” said Mitchell, commencing his second spell on England coaching staff. “Why? Because of what I’ve seen in the past. We haven’t had the desired outcome in the past year for a number of reasons and now we’re challenging ourselves to get better. I believe I can play a part in that.” Mitchell, says his priority will be to introduce a “more attacking mindset” to England defence having taken over from Paul Gustard, now in charge at Harlequins, but is also a forward expert who believes the best way to rattle the All Blacks is up front. “The set-piece platform and our ability to create pressure without the ball and feed our attack are pretty much a summary of what will allow us to put pressure on the All Blacks. They’re outstanding but a World Cup does close the gap for some reason.” Mitchell also insists he is a more mellow figure than he was during his first stint as an assistant coach with England under Clive Woodward years ago. “It nice to come back with more maturity and miles on the tyres. I wouldn’t be sitting here now if I hadn’t evolved. A lot of us coaches wouldn’t be around if we didn’t look to evolve and get better. It funny the perception you create and I sometimes laugh at it. Some people see that as the reality and it not.” Eddie Jones says old foe John Mitchell will get England thinking differently The former Sale and Wasps coach will not be involved in selection – “That the boss job” – but believes his extensive experience will help England. “If you look at the teams that are successful round the world, they generally have experienced coaches within their group playing roles as assistant coaches. It helps if you have seen the movie a few times.” Mitchell, who plans to relocate to south-west London full-time in January from his current family base in Durban, insists he has not flown in with any thoughts of succeeding Jones as head coach. “People will speculate but that not even in my mind,” he said. “I’ve got an enormous amount of respect for he way Eddie goes about things. Who wouldn’t want to work underneath him?” Not all England squad were fit to train in Bristol with Joe Launchbury (knee), Billy Vunipola (hamstring), Brad Shields (cheekbone) and Chris Ashton (hamstring) all nursing injuries.

40,"It is an expression more usually associated with sending people to sleep. But the Rugby Football Union will be hoping that the “white noise” that has inspired England new kit for the season can provide a wakeup call to Eddie Jones side. The new shirt – which costs – will be worn for the first time on November against South Africa, with a statement released by the RFU explaining that “the design of the shirt takes inspiration from ‘white noise’, the effect created by the sound of England supporters cheering the team on”. The term white noise is more regularly used to describe the hissing sound created by the static from electrical items such as televisions and radios without signal and can also be used to block out background noise in order to help people sleep. Eddie Jones says old foe John Mitchell will get England thinking differently Featuring a number of St George crosses “reflecting patriotism” as well as incorporating platinum and titanium colours “symbolising the strength of those metals”, the shirts will also include a one-piece crossover crew collar for increased comfort, which reduces “neck pump”, while the forward facing side seam allows “the jersey to twist with the player, aiding smooth movement”. A new alternate anthracite kit that Jones side is likely to wear only once – against Japan on November – has also been launched. The two new kits mean England have released in the last four years. New home and alternate kits are also expected to be released next season and worn by England in their World Cup warm-up matches in August and September as well as the subsequent Six Nations and on the summer tour of Japan. Separate World Cup kits will also be released.

41,"Set pieces separate New Zealanders Two New Zealand coaches presided over an old-school British game in which the set pieces shaped the outcome. Todd Blackadder is in his third season in charge at Bath while Chris Boyd moved to Northampton in the summer. Bath supremacy up front plus their lineout mastery gave them the platform for victory. Boyd noted how the scrum, a means of launching attacks in New Zealand, is more a means of establishing control in England. Blackadder said he could detect subtle changes in Northampton style under Boyd, but after slipping to in the table the basics will be the Saints’ immediate priority. Paul Rees Match report: Bath Northampton Black is the colour to end red-card muddle over misjudged tackles | Robert Kitson Marler lucky escape Most agree there are a lot of red cards these days, so let not complain when one is not shown. We can, though, muse on how lucky a player has been in this climate. Joe Marler forearm to the head/neck/shoulder of Andy Uren was raised unnaturally high. It did not look good. He escaped with yellow because they reckoned first contact was made on the shoulder, but, if there have to be reds, these acts of extracurricular violence are the sort they should go after. Marler looked more culpable than Will Spencer, who was shown red by the same referee the week before for an honest attempt at a tackle. Michael Aylwin Match report: Bristol Harlequins Saracens’ McCall wants solution to ‘complicated’ high-tackle situation Leicester face test of character If the scoreline hints at a vintage game of cut and thrust, the reality was different. Leicester were trailing with minutes to go and, despite clawing their way back to the Tigers still contrived to throw away all that good work by conceding their sixth try of the afternoon, scored by the highly promising debutant Ted Hill in the left corner in the dying minutes. The Warriors won at Leicester last season as well and there is no longer the same forbidding aura attached to Welford Road. Defensively the Tigers appear to be all at sea and their interim head coach Geordan Murphy must now pray that Sale do not cause a similar upset next weekend. Another disappointing home defeat and the Leicester board will be under huge pressure to change tack again. Robert Kitson Match report: Leicester Worcester Newcastle make Exeter dig deep Richard Wigglesworth: ‘We should be pretty proud of the Premiership now' Newcastle league position after the opening four rounds may look uncomfortable with three defeats, but they became the first team to prevent Exeter from securing a try bonus point when the Chiefs opted to kick their first penalty of the campaign. The Falcons forced Exeter to dig deep and in Simon Hammersley and Zach Kibirige had players whose quick feet took them out of tackles and into space. But Newcastle indiscipline allowed Exeter to kick deep and drive mauls, prompting the home side director of rugby, Dean Richards, to lament refereeing inconsistency at the breakdown in the league. PR Match report: Newcastle Exeter Le Roux sets heady pace There is a thesis to be written on the subject of southern hemisphere players commuting back and forth between the Rugby Championship and the English Premiership and whether the clubs concerned would, from a longer-term perspective, be better off resting them. Not many players could do what Willie le Roux did last week: beat the All Blacks in Wellington before flying halfway around the world to help steer Wasps to a bonus-point victory at Sale. His part in Nizaam Carr splendid try was further proof that, at this precise moment, the Springbok is rugby ultimate Martini man: anytime, any place, anywhere.

42,"Australia won’t curb their attacking instincts and are unlikely to tinker with their batting line-up, despite a top order collapse in the first women match against New Zealand. Chasing at North Sydney Oval on Saturday, Australia crashed to in the sixth over. An unbroken fifth wicket stand of between captain Meg Lanning and her deputy Rachael Haynes powered them to a six-wicket win with balls to spare. The Guardian women cricketer of the year Sarah Taylor Beth Mooney and Ashleigh Gardner were both caught in the deep, as Australia came out with all bats blazing. Veterans Lanning and Haynes steadied the ship after coming in at five and six respectively and champion allrounder Ellyse Perry never even got to the crease. Haynes, who captained the side last summer when Lanning was injured, doubted whether either of them or Perry would be moved up the order. “No I think we’ll back our batting line-up, that probably one of our strengths, that we do bat quite deep in our order,” Haynes said. “But I think everyone who comes in, we want them to play with aggression and play with a really positive style and intent. “I think tonight was a bit of a blueprint of what we want to come.” Haynes on Saturday notched her highest international score. Asked if she as in the best form of her career, Haynes said “Yeah, I’m a lot more relaxed about the whole thing to be honest. “When I was younger I was a bit too intense and didn’t take the time to enjoy it and now when I play, i just want to enjoy it.” She described the efforts of spinner Sophie Molineux as outstanding after the young Victorian allrounder conceded just runs off her four overs. Haynes said Australia bowlers needed to tidy up their execution for Monday second match in Brisbane, especially after conceding runs off their last two overs on Saturday. New Zealand coach Haidee Tiffen was also looking for better execution from her bowlers, and for her batters to start their late innings charge earlier than they did on Saturday and have fewer dot balls. She will also look for highly rated teenage spinner Amelia Kerr to bounce back after conceding off two overs, the worst economy rate of her international career.",382,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/lanning-and-haynes-rescue-australia-in-first-t20-with-new-zealand
43,"he last day of the domestic cricket season fell on Thursday when Essex, the defending county champions, played out the final day of the final match against this year champions Surrey, at the Oval. The sky was gentlest blue, the leaves of the south London trees thinking about falling. Entry was free and though the hordes failed to storm the bastion, the plastic tip-up seats filled up well enough, comfortable pair of trousers by comfortable pair of trousers, for a last deep breath of late summer. The day was a thriller, one of the very best, but no one knew that for sure when they wandered into the ground at half past What they really came for was to say goodbye. County cricket talking points: Surrey and Essex see out the season in style Humans have an inbuilt desire to commemorate endings. It why we hold funerals. It why we sign the leaving card that passes round the office and why we hug our family extra tight when they fly home to the other side of the world, reunions promised, but the unspoken understanding that the future is unknown. Cricketers’ retirements, coming as they do in September, have a particularly poignant air – thank you and goodbye to all this, the rhythms of the season, the turning of the year. This autumn, more players than ever seem to have hung up their tired old boots for good. Jimmy Adams and Sean Ervine, longstanding teammates at Hampshire, have retired together; the former England off-spinner James Tredwell, whose chronic shoulder injury prevented him playing a first-team game this season, has said goodbye to Kent. Andy Hodd, wicketkeeper and qualified electrician, who once left a wall half-plastered after fielding an emergency call from Yorkshire, has gone. So, too, has Jack Shantry, who captured the imagination of so many and ended up with a game named after him. There are more. But three names in particular stand out. At Edgbaston, the faithful gathered to say goodbye to Jonathan Trott , born in Cape Town, who came over to Birmingham as a young man and settled here, marrying Abi, who used to work at the club and whose grandfather was the former club captain. Trott is a complicated character, a talented, popular, hard-working batsman, who carried the fear of failure heavily. The fresh-faced young man who scored a century on his Test debut had a dream career with England until stress and anxiety struck on the tumultuous tour of Australia and he left early. His international career never recovered. But he fought back, and with his adopted county was able to find fulfilment and, even at the last, runs – of them in this year Championship, with a couple of centuries thrown in for good measure. The Kent players formed a guard of honour for his last innings and on Wednesday, in front of his family, he walked off the field for the last time, with Warwickshire Division Two champions. Down at Chelmsford, James Foster, the only man to stump Sachin Tendulkar in a Test match, hung up his wicketkeeping gloves after years. Despite a stellar career with the club the farewells this time were not quite as happy – Foster wanted to continue playing, Essex wanted to look to the future. But he was there at the Oval as Essex squeezed past Surrey, bearded now, but still with the same enthusiasm. After making his Test debut aged on England tour of India that fell the winter after the attack on the twin towers, he played seven Tests and ODIs for England – a man born out of his time, his specialist skills belonging to an era when glove men were not expected to be hulking great big bashers of runs. He is moving into coaching now, in demand from the new world of franchises, but after such a long time there is regret as well as excitement. “It feels weird that I’m no longer going to be a professional cricketer,” he said, “and it feels weird I won’t be driving to Chelmsford for work or any sort of affiliation with the club.” Finally, to the Riverside, where next season there will be a huge hole marked Paul Collingwood . He never claimed to be the most outrageously talented but, with a strawberry-blond smile, drew the very last drop out of his ability with bat, ball and in the field. He achieved nearly everything as a cricketer, even retiring from England at the right time. Internationally, he was part of three Ashes-winning sides and captained England side to the World Cup final, hitting the winning runs in – still the only World Cup trophy for the men team. But it was at Durham where he was most loved, a fixture for more than years, loyal through thick and thin – from the County Championship win in to the financial struggles and relegation that followed. Fabulous careers all, if not always the fairytales they believed in as young men: life can be a cruel mistress. Retirement for sportspeople is hard – go well, out into the world where cricket is not everything, where it often means very little, but new doors are waiting to be pushed.",870,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/29/paul-collingwood-cricket-exodus-end-of-season
44,"The Guardian Women Cricketer of the Year is an award given to a player who has done something truly remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. Sarah Taylor is the inaugural winner On November last year the two things Sarah Taylor knew were that she did not want to be where she was, and that she could not bring herself to go anywhere else. Two days earlier, England had lost a match to Australia in Sydney. The defeat meant England could not win the Ashes. After it, Taylor thoughts drifted. She started to worry about the long flight home later that week. Taylor tries to avoid aeroplanes. It is not a phobia – she likes flight, even enjoys the turbulence – it is that once the plane is up, there is no way off. And she is someone who needs to know she can make a quick getaway. That is why she decided to drive to the next match in Canberra, when everyone else flew. The journey was supposed to take three hours but seemed to go on so long she was utterly exhausted by the time she arrived. There was no time to recover because England had to play again the very next day. The panic started when she got to the ground. “It hard to explain,” she says. “Sometimes I tell people it like when you’re hungover, you feel really dehydrated, and like someone sitting on your head. Sometimes you’re in a crowd and you just feel like everyone on top of you, and you start to feel warm, and you just completely lose control. Anxiety is about losing control of your own thoughts.” I’ve had games where I was sick because I was so nervous ... I hated cricket for such a long time Always though, her breathing goes. It turns shallow and she starts to feel faint. “It completely irrational at the time, and you know it irrational, but you can’t change it.” She was not sure she could play that day. Then she saw her teammate, Tammy Beaumont, put on a pair of wicketkeeping gloves and start to warm up and something in her snapped. “As soon as I saw that I was like: ‘Nah, I’m not having that, I need to get my gloves on.’” She told England coach, Mark Robinson: “We need to get me through this.” So Taylor played. Between every over, her teammates fed her sweets to help her control her breathing, and put an iced towel around her neck to cool her down. The Guardian footballer of the year Juan Mata Half an hour into Australia innings, England quick Katherine Brunt was bowling, and Taylor was standing up to the stumps behind Elyse Villani, Australia No Villani stepped from her crease, swung her bat across the line and missed the ball. Taylor caught it, Villani stretched her foot back towards the crease, and in that split-second Taylor broke the bails. Villani was out for one run, stumped. It was a brilliant dismissal any time, let alone by a keeper fighting off a panic attack and feeling as if they might faint any minute. Brunt did not celebrate with Taylor but folded her into a hug and whispered, “Well done”. England won by runs. “Weirdly enough, I think actually playing that day did me more good than sitting in the changing room worrying,” Taylor says now. “Sometimes cricket is the trigger but then sometimes it my comfort zone, too.” Sport can be both the cause and the cure. Not that Taylor ever expects to be entirely rid of her illness, just that she hopes to learn to cope with it. “I think I will always have it to be honest, I think it is just an ongoing battle. But I’m not ashamed of it. I’m still a good person, I can still have a laugh. And I still can’t accept compliments or awards.” Which is unlucky, because she gets a lot of both. This is another. Taylor is the first winner of the Guardian new women cricketer of the year award, because of her batting and keeping, of course, and also the work she has done to raise awareness about mental illness. This year she was a key part of the England team who won two one-day series and a tri-series against New Zealand and South Africa, of the Sussex team who won promotion to the county championship first division, and the Surrey team who won the Kia Super League. Her keeping has become so good that Adam Gilchrist, who may well keep in the all-time team to play Mars, says that right now she is the “best in the world – male or female” . A ridiculous amount of people deal with anxiety. I wanted to let people know it was OK just to talk about it On Friday it was announced that she will miss the World in the West Indies later this year as she continues to manage her anxiety, a mutual decision taken by Taylor and England management team. When Taylor talks about her year so far, the word she uses most is “unscathed”. She is happy she came through it. Taylor is and says a bad year might have pushed her into retirement. It is not difficult to see why she has therefore decided to skip the tournament in the West Indies. There have been low moments along the way. When England broke the world record score, Taylor watched as her teammates blazed from the first balls for the opening wicket. “I was like: ‘I can’t do that’ and all of a sudden you doubt yourself, your anxiety kicks in and then you go into panic mode. The last thing I wanted to do was go out there and bat.” She did not. England sent Nat Sciver in instead. “And then you breathe out in relief.” Taylor has suffered like this for a long time. Only when it first started, she did not know what it was, and the team, even the sport, was not set up to provide her with the necessary support. “I’ve had games where I was sick because I was so nervous. And I thought it was normal. I thought: ‘Everyone goes through this.’ But actually I was having a panic attack.” She started to blame the game. “I thought: ‘Cricket done this to me, I don’t have this in my normal life, I hate cricket.’ And I did. I hated cricket for such a long time.” She tried to tell people about it but she did not have the words and they did not have the understanding. “There was almost a stigma, it was a case of ‘brush it off, you’re fine.’ It was a sign of weakness to say anything.” She does not blame anyone, “because at the time if someone had said that to me I would have been like: ‘It all right, just go have a good night sleep.’ But I like to think that now it would be dealt with a lot better.” It would. She says Robinson has been “unbelievable”. He maps out her season, looking for stress points like long trips between back-to-back matches, and tells her that when she is struggling he will be happy if she can simply get into her kit and out on to the field, let alone score any runs. Steve Harmison: ‘I didn’t want the public to know about my depression’ Taylor does not say it but she has helped push through that change too, by talking so honestly about her illness. In her lowest moment, when she took an indefinite break from the game in she decided she wanted to give an interview to the BBC to explain what was going on. “I think initially England said I had ‘personal issues’ and I wasn’t happy with that. I didn’t want people second-guessing me. So I said: ‘No, look, this is what going on.’ I’m not ashamed of it and I never have been. There a ridiculous amount of the population that suffers from it. And I wanted to let people know that it was OK to just talk about it.” Eighteen months later, Taylor teammate and friend Kate Cross felt able to speak about her own depression and anxiety too – how it had been so bad that she had spent three days in bed, crying to herself before England tour of the West Indies. “We were best mates for years but we never told each other,” Taylor says. “But I guess we didn’t know what it was at the time.” Now the team is a lot more open. “There a handful of girls who will say they have suffered with something, or they feel like they might be.” Taylor worries that in the lower levels of the sport, around the counties, players are not getting the support they need and that they will not until the women game has turned professional. As we finish talking, a shy young boy in a Middlesex kit comes up to ask for Taylor autograph. This happens a lot these days. “I even get the dads coming up to me saying: ‘Can you sign my gloves?’ I think that just shows where the women game has gone.” But the fans she really treasures are not always the ones who want to talk cricket. “I had one girl get in touch this summer. She suffers from anxiety as well. I think she from Essex, and she got a train all the way to Guildford to come and watch me play for Surrey, and it was, I think, one of the hardest things she done. So if people say to me: ‘What did I win this summer?’ Well I got a message from her and a card at the end of the season. That what I won.”",1653,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/28/sarah-taylor-guardian-womens-cricketer-of-the-year-2018
45,"Ball one: Surrey, on top, go down fighting With the last ball of the last day of the last match still standing in the County Champions could win, tie or lose to their predecessors – and they say this form of the game is outdated? Spoilsport, Ryan ten Doeschate, scored the runs that won a remarkable match, runs that denied Surrey an unbeaten season and a fairytale victory. Bowled out in a blaze of end of term carelessness for in the first dig, Surrey went in to bat for a second time trailing by runs. overs later, Essex were chasing an awkward for a win that had looked nailed on for two days. But you don’t win out of matches without spirit as well as skill, and it took a captain knock for Ten Doeschate to deny Surrey , who would not be bowed without a struggle to the bitter end. Great match, great season, great competition. Ball two: Bailey fails to bail out Lancashire It was too little (but only just) too late for Lancashire, who were relegated to Division Two by one point, Nottinghamshire having squeezed the two they needed out of a rampant Somerset side. That said, Nottinghamshire won four matches to Lancashire three, so there can be few complaints from Old Trafford, only a list of what might have been – but cricket, like life, is never short of those once you go looking. This match was another personal triumph for Tom Bailey, whose four wickets in each innings saw him finish the season as the leading wicket-taker in Division One with scalps at Quite what he and Graham Onions wickets at in matches) think of their batsmen might not be printable. It amazing to think that they took of available wickets between them – and their team still went down. Ball three: Nottinghamshire suffer twin hat-tricks against Somerset Nottinghamshire were almost caught wearing their flip-flops prematurely, as Somerset hammered them by an innings and runs in a match that saw two hat-tricks, one for all-rounder (yes, I’m calling it) Tom Abell and one for Craig Overton. Or should that be Marcus Trescothick, who caught Ben Slater, Samit Patel and Riki Wessels at second slip? That a fine way to celebrate a one year contract extension that will take him to into Brian Close territory down Taunton way. Somerset finish the season as runners-up – somewhere, I think I’ve read that before. Ball four: Brooks leaves Yorkshire in style Speaking of “all-rounders”, Jack Brooks carried his sweaty headband from the Yorkshire dressing room for the last time, signing off with in Worcestershire first innings and when he got a bat in his hand. With Ben Coad and Gary Ballance also enjoying a fine match, the Tykes’ win took them to fourth place in the table, but everyone knows the White Rose could easily have suffered the Red Rose fate had the dice fallen slightly differently. Worcestershire will play in Division Two in but that been expected for a while now – it usually is when a team perhaps best suited to Division play in the top flight. Ask Daryl Mitchell – a fine cricketer, but a man with the unenviable (and undeserved) record of five relegations on his CV. Ball five: Bears climb to top of the tree Warwickshire handed Jonathan Trott the Division Two title as a leaving present after their sorta play-off against Kent turned into a procession. When in-form openers, Will Rhodes and Dom Sibley, took the Bears past Kent first innings total of the jig was up for Sam Billings’ men, who can nevertheless look back on a fine season that saw them promoted to Division One and play in a Lord final. And, speaking of looking back with pleasure, the same applies to Jonathan Trott, one of many cricketers taking their leave this week with the thanks and genuine affection of their counties’ supporters and cricket fans everywhere. Ball six: Paul Collingwood leaves with love Which brings us to perhaps the fondest farewell of all. Paul Collingwood OBE (yes, OBE) played his final match for Durham, its most noblest servant bowing out with a defeat at the hands of Middlesex , who shot out the man from Shotley Bridge team for when would have been enough for a valedictory victory. So the man whose first innings in Championship cricket was terminated on by the late Kevin Curran (Sam and Tom dad) walks away into the weakening North East sun, the strawberry blond hair fading a little to grey, the applause ringing in his ears.

46,"Adil Rashid has been rewarded for his performances over the summer with a Test central contract from England, with Jos Buttler and Sam Curran also included among players on the red-ball list but no opening batsman. The leg spinner – who signed a new all-format contract with Yorkshire this month having previously played as a white-ball specialist – played in all five Tests in the victory over India but was used sparingly by captain Joe Root in a series dominated by seam. Yet with the expected to play a major role in Sri Lanka in the forthcoming series alongside fellow spinners Moeen Ali and Jack Leach, Rashid is one of seven players to be handed contracts covering both Test and white-ball cricket with Root, Buttler, Moeen, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes. However, following the decision of the former England captain Alastair Cook to retire from international cricket after the Test series against India, there is a big vacancy at the top of the order which needs to be filled. Cook latest opening partner Keaton Jennings, the Lancashire batsman, misses out on a deal, while Rory Burns had pressed his case when scoring more than runs in the County Championship to help Surrey win a first title in years. Essex beat Surrey by one wicket to head off world record attempt – as it happened England have split their annual deals into red- and white-ball cricket since the end of the season, the former continuing as straight replacements for county contracts and the latter paying salaries to short-form players on top of their domestic arrangements. Surrey all-rounder Curran, who was named player of the series against India after match-changing half-centuries at Edgbaston and the Ageas Bowl and wickets via his left-arm swing, is also included for the first time. That means England gain greater control over his workload and will have a say in whether he is to be made available for next year IPL, amid rising interest from a number of franchises including Virat Kohli Royal Challengers Bangalore. Meanwhile, Curran older brother Tom, who also plays for Surrey, has been awarded an incremental contract for the next months, while Liam Plunkett, Jason Roy and David Willey are among those to be retained on the white-ball list.

47,"What thrills! What spectacle! On the last day of the season, there was only one match still standing – between the new champions and the old at the Kia Oval – one last hurrah before the nights grow long and the grass shrivels back to its winter rest. And it had it all, won by Essex with a brushed four, with only one wicket left. Skill, high tension and occasional farce was punctuated at the end by an air of mystery when the ECB chairman, Colin Graves, failed to present the Championship trophy, despite being in the county chairmen meeting just the other side of the ground. The meeting, said the ECB, took precedence, which was a shame, as it was a day to publicly celebrate all that was good about the game. With free entry Surrey started their advance on what would have been a record-breaking win, adding to their overnight score, to finish a mere runs more than their disastrous first innings. Rikki Clarke notched up a quick with one more heave of the old body, and there were five wickets for Matt Coles, who only came into the match midway through as a concussion substitute for Sam Cook. To win, Essex had to score – runs more than the that Morne Morkel had requested from his batsmen in the dressing room on Wednesday evening. After lunch the Surrey captain, Rory Burns, threw the ball to Morkel. There would be no quarter given, that much was clear when he turned at the top of his run and high-stepped in, all purring Ferrari, hands low ready for the heist. He struck in his second over, Murali Vijay stumps splattered for two. Amar Virdi and Jade Dernbach followed with two wickets apiece, three catches snaffled by Rikki Clarke at slip, and at for five Essex were in trouble. But the captain, Ryan ten Doeschate, and Adam Wheater hustled through the fire with a partnership of Morkel had not finished. Steam up, he came back for his second spell. Wheater and Harmer were dispatched in the same over, then Porter lbw with needed. Tea was postponed and when Matt Coles was run-out after a mix-up with Ten Doeschate with only eight needed and one wicket to take, all seemed lost. But somehow, despite some chaotic running, despite last man Matthew Quinn being hit on the helmet by -Morkel, Essex did it, the winning runs hit by Ten Doeschate, in one of the pluckiest innings of the season. The players embraced on the pitch and Ten Doeschate called his Essex team down to applaud the Surrey players up the pavilion steps. Burns, who had won nearly every award going at the Surrey Awards Night, was magnanimous in their only defeat of the year: “As an advert for the game and the County Championship, it was everything that it needed to be,” he said. “Even in not winning this game we’ve shown what we’re about.” And with that the season was gone. That really is it everyone - thank you for a wonderful season. Onward to the next!

49,"Mitch Marsh and Josh Hazlewood will share Test vice-captaincy duties after Australia rejigged its traditional leadership model in response to the Cape Town cheating scandal. David Warner was stripped of his title and barred from ever holding a leadership post as part of the sanctions Cricket Australia (CA) handed down six months ago in South Africa. Marsh, who captains Western Australia and led Australia A earlier this month, was always considered the frontrunner in the leadership race to be skipper Tim Paine understudy. David Warner starts slow rebuild with instant coffee and a rapid hundred But the governing body sprung something of a surprise on Thursday, with the allrounder and paceman Hazlewood both appointed vice-captains. “We believe the new leadership model will best support the captain. It is a successful model used across various sporting codes around the world,” chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said. “We see it benefiting the group. Not just from a tactical perspective but also to help drive the team values and standards on and off the field.” The appointment of Marsh and Hazlewood came after a player vote and formal interview, both of which were unprecedented measures from CA. Hazlewood and Marsh presented to a panel that consisted of selectors Hohns and Greg Chappell, CA chairman David Peever, CA board member Mark Taylor, coach Justin Langer, team psychologist Michael Lloyd and CA high-performance boss Pat Howard. The new process reflected CA desperation to improve team culture in the aftermath of the ball-tampering saga. The rethink was also caused by the fact the Test vice-captaincy has previously come with the unofficial title of captain-in-waiting, creating unwanted friction between leaders and few seamless successions. “It was not a process designed to find the next Australian Test captain but to find two vice-captains who will support and help drive the team goals and objectives,” Hohns said. “Josh and Mitch display great leadership qualities and we were extremely impressed by their passion and energy.” Marsh vowed he and Hazlewood would do everything they can to make Paine life easier. “I’ve certainly grown as a leader in the last months for Western Australia. I’ve found out a lot about myself, about leadership,” Marsh said. “Hopefully I’ll be able to instil that on young guys coming through, what it is to be an Australian cricketer and what we stand for going forward.” Hazlewood will miss the Test series against Pakistan, which starts on October in Dubai, because of a back injury.",410,/sport/,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/27/marsh-and-hazlewood-appointed-australian-test-joint-vice-captains
0,"aving something to say is one thing; having a way to make people listen is a whole other bag.” This is what an awestruck Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) tells fledgling singer-songwriter Ally, played by Lady Gaga, in the newest and shiniest remake of A Star Is Born . Premiering last month at Venice film festival to rave reviews – and early Oscars buzz for both Cooper and Gaga – it is, as Variety Owen Gleiberman put it, “a transcendent Hollywood movie”. As far as pop music is concerned, the messenger matters. Like the traditional Hollywood musical, pop star movies follow the familiar arc of an artist finding their voice – and, best of all, feature real pop stars. As a pop music superfan who struggles with musicals and the tiresome way they crowbar narrative into song and dance numbers, I’m obsessed with this movie subgenre. They’re fascinating as vehicles for stardom – and revealing about the kind of icons the pop stars turned actors want to be associated with, as well as the legacies they wish to leave themselves (consider Diana Ross as Billie Holiday in Lady Sings the Blues , and Beyoncé as a version of Diana Ross in Dreamgirls ). In an age of hyperdocumentation, pop stars are more precious than ever about how their star personas are perceived. Yet in the reflection of another star image, we can often see them more clearly. They can be based on real people, like Gregory Nava under-appreciated Selena which featured Jennifer Lopez – now a successful actor in her own right – as the late Tejano music diva Selena Quintanilla, or imagined ones, like Whitney Houston Rachel Marron in The Bodyguard (Mick Jackson, possibly the greatest pop star movie of all time. That film starred Houston at the apex of her fame, making for a metatextual masterpiece that captured her luminosity at its brightest, before it flickered as she declined into drugs. They can be Oscar success stories, like Motown musical Dreamgirls , for which American Idol finalist Jennifer Hudson won the award for best supporting actress (her fizzing performance makes co-star Beyoncé look like a half-empty can of flat Coke). They can also be the stuff of Golden Raspberry lore, for example Glitter a tragically bad, box-office flop that features Mariah Carey botched cover of Tom Browne Funkin’ for Jamaica (NY) on the soundtrack. It saw Carey receive a Razzie for worst actress (probably not helped by the film release date, just one week after If you’re lucky, you might get two pop stars in the same movie – Burlesque starred Christina Aguilera as a small-town waitress who moves to Los Angeles and winds up singing in a nightclub run by – wait for it – Cher. Some pop star movies are misunderstood, like the Shonda Rhimes-scripted Crossroads which followed Britney “Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman” Spears as she road-tripped in search of her estranged mother, writing songs with strange boys en route. Others, like Cadillac Records , which tried and failed to channel the world-weary soul singer Etta James via a stiff-backed Beyoncé , are simply miscast. Sometimes pop stars are just silver-screen versions of themselves; either played straight, like Eminem Detroit rapper on the rise, Jimmy “B-Rabbit” Smith, in the autobiographical Mile or as straight parody (the Spice Girls movie, Spice World , an endearingly wacky satire on fame and the free press directly inspired by the Beatles’ A Hard Day Night ). According to Martha Shearer, lecturer in film studies at King College London, pop star films “have been a significant component of Hollywood cinema going back to the coming of sound”, with some of the biggest stars of the studio era, like Bing Crosby and Doris Day, making their name as pop singers first. The key turning point, she says, was in the when films became increasingly driven by the popularity of their soundtracks. Or, more specifically, two years earlier, in with Grease . Based on the stage musical of the same name, it made use of pop stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, both of whom had enjoyed chart hits (Travolta with Let Her In in one year before he starred in John Badham Saturday Night Fever ; Newton-John with the singles If Not For You and Banks of the Ohio in In the US, the soundtracks for both Saturday Night Fever and Grease were the No and No two bestselling albums of the year. It was a watershed moment that signalled an appetite for these kinds of movies and set a precedent for the Grammy-winning soundtrack to The Bodyguard to make history as the first album to sell more than a million copies within a one-week period. It not unfair to expect pop stars to be able to act. “Singers often make fabulous actors… all singing is acting”, writes Stephanie Zacharek in Time review of A Star Is Born . And the writer and founder of music website Popjustice, Peter Robinson, says: “Booking an actual singer for the job does a lot of the heavy lifting for a screenwriter or director. You see Gaga and you think of talent, hard work, and a sense that this person deserves to make it because, well, this face you recognise made it in real life.” The casting of Lady Gaga is pitch perfect – the singer we see on screen is a gooseflesh-inducing volt of electricity Bradley Cooper casting of Lady Gaga as an ingénue on the rise is pitch perfect. Stripped of the bells, whistles and wigs that served as a fundamental part of her real star persona, the singer we see on screen is a gooseflesh-inducing volt of electricity. Cooper fading country-rock star encounters Gaga Ally a drag show in a dive bar – a detail that revels in Gaga real coming of age in drag bars on Manhattan Lower East Side (the same is true of French pop star Héloïse Letissier, who was reborn as Christine and the Queens in London Madame Jojo). Masked by dramatic eyebrows and painted red lips, Ally belts out Edith Piaf La Vie En Rose with the commanding, easy confidence of somebody who has performed to a crowd a thousand times before, even finishing with a Flashdance -style dip. A Carole King poster hangs in Ally bedroom, but before long a star-making viral video of Shallow lands her a major label record deal with Interscope (to whom Gaga is signed), and she swapping her acoustic guitar for hip-hop choreography to match the manufactured R&amp;B pop assigned to her. Her mousy hair is dyed bright red, not unlike Britney in the video for her single Toxic . Seeing this version of Ally on stage at the Grammy awards doesn’t exactly feel like a suspension of disbelief. In A Star Is Born emotional centrepiece, Ally joins Jackson on stage to sing, and the film invites the audience to forget, for a moment, that they are watching a master of her craft who has spent the best part of years selling out arenas. Yet it convincing precisely because Gaga has lived a version of this character. As she said in an interview with Vogue , her “natural state” is “dancing and crying”. Shearer says that while performance scenes like this can help to create authenticity, the presence of a real pop star can also “exacerbate the tension between narrative and the standalone attraction of musical performance where the narrative seems like a flimsy excuse”. Robinson is similarly sceptical about how A Star Is Born might be received. “I think Gaga fanbase will approach that recognition factor quite differently,” he says, explaining that the film might be seen as “a career lifeline for someone whose biggest days as a pop star were the best part of a decade ago”. Yet the film is less a resuscitation of Gaga career than it is a defibrillator to the musical melodrama, a genre that has been sadly dormant since The Bodyguard . Cooper A Star Is Born is the fourth retelling of a classic story whose earlier iterations starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March Judy Garland and James Mason and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson For Robinson, there irony in Gaga – an artist known for writing her own material – “launching her acting career in a film that essentially a cover version of a cover version”. But A Star Is Born cheekily acknowledges its legacy, with Jackson telling Ally that pop music is “the same story told over and over again”. All the artist can offer the world is how they see it, he says. Indeed, in the film closing credits, the woman born Stefani Germanotta is billed as Lady Gaga.

1,"‘He was a manipulative bully. He would mimic people when he was shouting at them. We were all adults, but made to feel Anonymous, London office I’d had other jobs in the industry before and felt this one, in Harvey Weinstein London office, was a step up. The business was very successful at this point. There was a fairly high turnover of staff; I worked there for just under a year. Harvey loves Europe, and he came to London all the time. He was here days or two weeks in every month. We used to joke, “Thank God Concorde doesn’t exist any more” because at least we had a bit of notice. But he never set foot in the office, ever – business was entirely run from hotels. The office was a dump in Soho, so it didn’t seem unusual. There were two interviews for the job. I got a full briefing in the first interview about him being a bully, from the people who worked with him. I remember giving that same chat myself when I was interviewing later: this is the reality. I think it is a bit alluring – you’re thinking, “I can handle that.” Before my second interview with him, which was at a hotel, I did get warned about him going in to the bathroom and masturbating. But that person was very gossipy and I didn’t think it was realistic – it sounded so out there. I just didn’t believe it, which feels a bit ridiculous now. They made a bit of a joke about him being a perv: “Keep your coat on.” Now I think: didn’t that seem strange, and didn’t that seem wrong? But people were talking affectionately, if eye-rollingly, about him. I didn’t think I could expect better: if everyone else was OK with it, who was I to make a fuss? The conversation with Harvey was very brief, because the person in the London office had already decided they wanted me. He said something I heard him say to a lot of people: “I have a very good instinct. I can always tell when I’m going to get on well with someone.” I was told during my training that you must never lie to Harvey, or even fudge something – he would know. He has x-ray vision, and once he gets the bit between his teeth, he won’t let it go. But he also forgot things people had said only moments before, or went back on some big declaration he had just made, occasionally to his advantage. There were two parts to the job. The real work had very little to do with him: there were a lot of projects, attending festivals, trying to meet film-makers and writers. And there was the other part, which was his visits and dealing with him. It felt like everyone was his assistant. The philosophy was that the company runs best when Harvey is happy, so you have to make sure things run smoothly. Meetings were made and cancelled or moved or ran late, at the drop of a hat, and he’d be furious with us even though he had caused it. Weekends weren’t relevant, evenings were not relevant, breakfast meetings were scheduled for after being up till My days were rarely the same, the only constant being that they were chaotic and adrenalised. You would end up being proud of the strangest things, like getting through the day without being screamed at, or without him publicly abusing someone else – a waiter, a colleague, a director, a driver. It was a horrible feeling to be screamed at or “fired” (he threatened this multiple times a day). But it was far worse to see him abuse someone else. Fighting back didn’t work with him, really, but you could intervene on someone else behalf and draw his fire. It was like tending to a giant, belligerent, disgusting baby. His moods dictated so much that you constantly thought about whether he was tired, hungry, thirsty, cold. Sometimes he’d scream at you in front of someone you respected, and it bothers me to this day that they'd let it pass I got told early on that he had girlfriends. Sometimes he would want them invited to things, or to send a car. Some were actresses, some I don’t know what they did. He was part of a rich-person circuit and a few of the women were connected to that. We’d never know when a girlfriend was going to turn up, or when we’d have to lie to his wife. But he would be happier afterwards. Now I worry those interactions were not necessarily what I took them to be. His first visit to London was a few weeks after I started. His family were on the trip, and that was quite challenging. You are being told that it not your job [to look after them], but aware that they need to be kept amused and happy. He never, ever stopped working, and that was a bit sad to see. We used to say that he was either working or whoring: he barely slept. Part of the reason there is a culture of silence, which is not unique to Harvey Weinstein , is that in this industry you can be made to feel a bit prudish if you are uncomfortable. This was definitely his cover: that it was nobody business if he was cheating on his wife. I saw him become obsessed with the odd A-list actress, promising to win them an Oscar. But these were not private meetings. There were always plenty of people in the room. I haven’t spoken to the press before. I felt this wasn’t about me: it is for those people who have alleged assault to take up the story. But I don’t want to be in the business of protecting the Weinstein company, either. And my perspective is useful. I can completely believe that people who worked for him didn’t know about the extent of his conduct. He was a horrible, manipulative bully; he would mimic people when he was shouting at them. We were all adults, but you were made to feel You had to think about it really carefully: how much is this job worth? I used to have this horrible feeling of, what if my partner or family saw me when he was yelling at me? It would be very humiliating. And this was all the time – not in the heat of production. You couldn’t believe the good things that he said because then you had to believe the bad things, too. You had to say to yourself: this is him freaking out, it not my fault. Fairly often his screaming involved a boast about himself: I can call the president, and I can call this person. He was telling us how important he was, and it was tiring but we would laugh about it afterwards. Sometimes he’d scream at you in front of someone you respected or had worked with, and that bothers me to this day – that they would let it pass. Everyone wanted to get their movie made, and I understand that; but I feel sick that his bullying was allowed to flourish in public and no one ever said, “This isn’t acceptable.” If you raised it, you were laughed off as naive; there was the underlying feeling that maybe you just weren’t good enough to really impress him. This was – bluntly – bullshit. Plenty of stupid people could rise through the ranks, and plenty of great people were lost to the company because of Harvey bullying. I think behaving as outrageously as he did, and no one doing more than shaking their head or laughing nervously, made him believe he had all the power. He felt untouchable. There was the odd male assistant. They were always quite tall and good-looking, and they were resented and envied by Harvey. His insecurities were close to the surface, and his awareness that he was not an attractive man was quite evident. He also felt less able to bully them – or maybe the bullying took a different form. He was good at currying favour. He would hunt down a first edition to send to someone with a note: “We should make this sometime.” I would see him with some people – actresses, film-makers – and think, “This does feel like grooming” and hope they knew what they were getting into. I would look at some of the people and think: this is not right – they were not likely to be actually professionally good. There were people who would do two or three meetings and then say, “I’m not doing this again.” He would be asking them to come, and they would be busy, and alarm bells would be ringing. In those instances I think they had twigged what was coming. We were all across his email. We just thought he was an intensely energetic philanderer – we’d joke about the amount of people who wanted to sleep with him. There were a lot; it didn’t feel as if he was only a predator. Women would come up to him, give him their numbers – very, very beautiful women, models and actresses. We would work in the car with one of Harvey girlfriends there. They felt like transactional relationships, although he never really carried cash. I don’t want to imply I don’t believe those who have come forward, because all those accounts make so much sense now. It horrible; how could none of us have connected the severity of his bullying with how that might be expressed through his sexual side? I didn’t love the role of keeping the family busy: that felt a bit gross. It was not explicit, but we had to make sure that his wife or kids should not go to his hotel room: “It not a good time.” I was part of that; we all endorsed and stood beside him. I feel bad about his fixation with certain things, and with two or three famous actresses. He had crushes and would try to insist on having meetings without their partners or agents present. Thankfully, those meetings never really transpired. I thought the actresses were the powerful ones. Now, I wonder. He used to say, “See me like a king. I’m your pass to places.” He learned the things you wanted from the job, and he would hold that over you as a carrot, to do better. But I left because life was too short. We were coming up to a round of festivals and I thought, I am not getting much out of this. And I was beginning to feel a sense of shame I couldn’t put my finger on. I had wanted to be the sort of person who could “handle it”, but emotionally I couldn’t. I was very adrenalised and nervous all the time. I had to leave before I got fired. Harvey Weinstein is not the only monster on the hill that we need to kill. The culture that allowed him to hide in plain sight still needs to be addressed, and I think that barely begun. It should be embarrassing for people to scream at employees, for the fate of an entire company to rest on a bully whims. If he hadn’t been able to steamroller and abuse people for so long, his other, far worse behaviour might have been called out much earlier. Perhaps people are more nervous of sexual harassment lawsuits now. But I think the bullying and the culture of silence around it still flourishes. ‘A colleague came into the office one day, saying, “Call the police, Harvey just attacked me!” That was probably his last day’ Mark Lipsky, New York office I worked for the Weinsteins three separate times, between and When I came on board, it was in a two-bedroom apartment on Broadway, with Harvey in one bedroom and [his brother] Bob in the other, and half a dozen of us in the living room. That was Miramax. They did with me what they went on to do with many, many people: they offered me a position that no other employer would have done. I came in as the head of sales and marketing. They were very good at handing out titles that were unavailable elsewhere, and at that point they owned you. Where were you going to go? You would see some terrible stuff. I remember one time Harvey was holding a meeting in a conference room. It was standing room only. And he just went off at this woman, calling her a man name – Richard or something. It wasn’t even a name that could have gone either way. It was completely psychotic. In this overcrowded room of people who had got so used to the insanity, there wasn’t a whole lot of surprise. I don’t know what the effect was on that woman, but it couldn’t have been good. It fairly well-known that Bob was even scarier than Harvey. There was a moment at Miramax when we had this awful movie, this unwatchable movie, that had to be released in order to satisfy a video deal. In the late videos were where the money was. We had to do whatever it took to get this film opened in three or four or five markets and then throw it at the video company and get a cheque. One of those cities was Seattle and I had to commit to a certain level of advertising to get the theatre to book it, and I did. Bob came into my office one morning and said, “We’re not spending any money on that movie. Call them up and cancel ads.” And I said no: I had made the commitment. Bob got more and more frustrated. I had a cup of pencils on my desk and he started taking a pencil out of the cup, breaking it, and throwing it on the floor. One after the other after the other, and saying something to me that I still can’t understand. “Are you tight? Are you tight now?” I was bemused. Sort of enjoying the show almost. Not a lot of people left in my time. I was one of the few. We had someone senior who came running into the office one morning. Big guy, lovely guy. Red and sweating, and saying, “Someone call the police, Harvey just attacked me.” He said Harvey attacked him on the street in front of the office. That was probably his last day. I don’t think anyone called the police. It was always Harvey and Bob against the world. They trusted no&nbsp;one, and in the end, they didn’t even trust each other They made every girl in the office cry. There were lots of apologies and flowers. I wasn’t around it as it festered. My jaw didn’t exactly hit the floor when I started reading the accusations [last October], but it got halfway there. I believed everything was true, but the degree of depravity was surprising. The irony of ironies was that they distributed a documentary called Bully, and Harvey talked about how bullying was a terrible thing. He virtually invented bullying. For me, it was largely educational. It made me better at navigating questionable personal relationships. I’m a straight shooter, but there were lessons to be learned in terms of how to manoeuvre and how to survive under adverse conditions. I would shout back at them, but most people didn’t. They ruled with an iron fist, and you did not want to lose your job because it was a great job, except for the poisonous environment. People could escape it physically; that the only way they were able to keep some of their top executives, because they were miles away in California. That eventually changed, because it got so big and there was so much money that Harvey was essentially bi-coastal and miles meant nothing. What they did best was negotiate. They were great negotiators, and even better renegotiators. They would hammer you and hammer you. And the next day come back and say, “No, that not good enough.” That was the way they approached life. It was them against the world, or the world against them. They were such bad managers and so paranoid that there was no room for trust, even for people who were close to them in business. It was always only ever Harvey and Bob, fighting the good fight. They trusted no one but each other, and eventually, they didn’t even trust each other. ‘Harvey insisted on being present when we signed an NDA. It was distressing and intimidating. He apologised, essentially an admission’ Zelda Perkins, London office It was when I left Miramax in and tried to pursue justice that the scales really fell from my eyes; in some ways, the real abuse started then. I began working for Harvey when I was only and didn’t really know who he was; partly through my naivety, partly through my upbringing, I happened to have the right set of tools in my personality to deal with him. I simply saw him as an unpleasant, lascivious boss and so treated him as such. I didn’t initially understand his power, or see him as the key to my future, which were the things that made so many others vulnerable to him. But the challenge turned into a nightmare when a new colleague alleged Harvey had tried to rape her while we were at the Venice film festival . I had employed her to assist me, so she was my responsibility; once she told me, there was no possibility of us continuing to work for him. On going to lawyers we were told, to our horror, that our only realistic option was to make a damages claim and enter into an agreement. They told me it wasn’t worth considering going to court. It became increasingly apparent that this had little to do with justice and everything to do with money and power. I had presumed the law was above all men, but the disparity of my position and Harvey trumped whatever he had done; the ensuing legal process ultimately broke my belief in the core values of our culture. That is more seismic than having your belief broken in one individual. Miramax was represented by one of the most powerful “magic circle” law firms on the globe, Allen &amp; Overy. Even though the allegations were of a serious criminal nature, a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) was negotiated that, as far as I can see, was wholly unethical. The agreement includes things that were legally extraordinary. Under its terms, my colleague and I would not be able to speak to a doctor, counsellor or accountant about what had happened, without them also signing an NDA, which we would be held accountable to if they broke it. The most sinister of these clauses stipulated that I was to use my “best endeavours” not to disclose anything in a civil or criminal case brought against Weinstein. In other words, I was to keep quiet, whatever the circumstances, for ever. The NDA took hours of complex and stressful negotiations in Allen &amp; Overy offices. The experience was one of complete siege mentality, with sessions lasting up to hours. On one day, after a full morning negotiations, we resumed at and finished at the next day. You lost track of time and space. We were two young women shut in a room full of lawyers talking in legal riddles, and we were not able to tell anyone what we were doing. From the beginning, it was imperative to me that money never changed hands. But it was made very clear that a financial demand was the standard and only formula. At this point, our entire motivation became focused on the fact that, if we could not prosecute Harvey, then we had to stop his behaviour and protect people in the future, in exchange for our silence. Other obligations that were agreed were that Harvey would have to attend therapy for three years, and that Miramax would be forced to inform Disney (its parent company) or fire him if any further settlements were attempted. I don’t believe anyone had tried to do this before; it seems clear from the horrifying list of further allegations that have since emerged that his side of the agreement was not upheld. I always felt we were being made to do something we didn’t want to do. However, it wasn’t a simple situation and it was not just about me. My colleague was in a very psychologically vulnerable position, having experienced extreme trauma in the first few weeks of her job, and we were being given frightening advice with few options. I had no choice but to do what our lawyers were telling us, even if it wasn’t what I wanted to hear. Harvey insisted on being present on the day we signed the agreement. He apologised for his behaviour and offered us anything we wanted to return to the company. This was the first time my colleague had seen him since the attempted rape and it was obviously very distressing and intimidating. There seemed to be no protection within the system to stop this. His words that day were essentially an admission, all of which was noted down by our lawyer. But when we got up to leave, Harvey team insisted the notes be destroyed. Harvey Weinstein: the women who have accused him My film career came to a halt after that. It a small industry, and there were whispers and rumours. No one knew what had happened, of course, but after several uncomfortable interviews, it became clear people didn’t want to risk upsetting Harvey, and I couldn’t defend my reputation. My goal now is to ensure that NDAs cannot be weaponised and used to hide criminal behaviour. Law firms have been enabling questionable behaviour and making money out of these agreements. And this is not just limited to sexual harassment; it is far more insidious within our work culture. My NDA would have been unenforceable, but this was never made clear to me and I lived in fear of it for years – until last year. I felt I had been criminalised and that, if I spoke, I would be the one going to jail. There will always be characters like Weinstein; we can’t deny the existence of charismatic, sociopathic and dangerous characters, and they seem to people the top echelons of most businesses. But as a society, we have a responsibility to make sure that employees are protected – and that if they are abused, they have true recourse. There is a place for NDAs, but they have become an immoral tool, legally used to silence victims. The circumstances in which they are created need to be carefully examined, and regulated. Earlier this year, I gave evidence to MPs at a select committee inquiry to examine sexual harassment in the workplace, and the improper use of NDAs. The lawyer who negotiated my NDA from Allen &amp; Overy gave evidence immediately after me. I was sitting right behind him, watching his neck getting redder and redder as he was asked whether he had produced an agreement that could pervert the course of justice. I got terrible nervous giggles, because I hadn’t expected the MPs to be so aggressive. Unfortunately, the representative sent to the inquiry from Simons Muirhead &amp; Burton (my solicitors years earlier) had not been involved with my case. My argument was not with the individual lawyers, nor even with the firms. My argument is with the fact that they were doing something apparently legal. A positive thing to have emerged from the inquiry is that the Solicitors Regulation Authority is now investigating; this, and the recommendations made by the select committee, mean there is a real chance that significant change will come. If power and money put you above the law, then the law is worth nothing. And that, fundamentally, is more frightening and dangerous than an ego out of control.

2,"here something a little different about the new Transformers movie, Bumblebee, judging by the debut trailer that hit the web earlier this week . Is it that the sci-fi saga has restored the classic forms some of us just about remember from the television show? Bumblebee is directed by Kubo and the Two Strings director Travis Knight, rather than Michael Bay, who directed the previous five Transformers films, and the title character is once again based on a friendly-looking Volkswagen Beetle, rather than Bay macho Chevy Camaro, while Optimus Prime has the blocky, retro look of the original toy. Or is it that the new film is a prequel set in the While these are important developments, which will hopefully allow Knight to carve out a new direction for the series following Bay shift to a producer role, the most noticeable aspect of the new trailer is the way the new female lead Hailee Steinfeld is presented, in comparison to some of her unluckier female forebears. Steinfeld is the same age Megan Fox was when she appeared as Mikaela Banes in Bay first Transformers movie in Both actors play characters in their late teens, but while Fox spent most of her movie being gleefully leered at by Bay cameras – and her replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley got it even worse in Transformers: Dark of the Moon – Steinfeld has apparently escaped such horrors. Instead of being an object of desire for the saga presumably mostly male and teenage audience, the tomboyish Charlie Watson is presented through a filter borrowed from teen movies such as Karate Kid, Risky Business and Ferris Bueller Day Off, each of which also treated cars as an essential part of the coming-of-age process. We can only hope that studio Paramount won’t now be subjected to the kind of backlash suffered by Lucasfilm over its decision to shift the gender balance among Star Wars characters over the past few episodes. Certainly, fans of Bay films may be in for a shock when they turn up to the multiplex to find this is a movie about a girl and her robot, rather than a feature-length throwback to the Loaded magazine era. Some people may wonder if Knight vision for the future of the franchise owes something to the change in attitudes since Transformers first hit cinemas. Surely there would be a few eyebrows raised in were Bay to ask his lead actor to wash his Ferrari by way of a screen test, which is what Fox was reportedly subjected to prior to signing up to Transformers, or demand an actor perform a “runway stomp” for the film-maker and his crew in the middle of the desert while wearing only “a bra and underwear and a big, billowing, black, floor-length cape and high heels”, as happened to Huntington-Whitely ? The truth is that Transformers never really needed sex in the first place – certainly not the leering, lascivious kind served up in the early movies. Bay is the kind of film-maker who could shoehorn boob and bum shots into a big-screen adaptation of The Care Bears. But Transformers, as Bumblebee seems set to prove, looks a lot more comfortable as a PG offering. Transformers’ core audience does not necessarily need to be horny male teenagers. The toys are not usually found in the adult section of Smyths, and Optimus Prime doesn’t transform into a Rampant Rabbit when you press his helmet. Bay and his ilk may not like it, but it turns out there are times when cinematic infantilisation can be a positive step forward. Especially for a property that was always supposed to be for children in the first place. This is where Transformers always belonged, sat next to warm-hearted kid-and-their-robot movies such as The Iron Giant and Big Hero Six, not jostling for space in the DVD bargain bin with old copies of Barb Wire and Hardbodies . The only question is why Paramount and Bay took so long to work it out.",665,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/28/bumblebee-hailee-steinfeld-transformers-is-for-kids
3,"hen it comes to Harry Potter , JK Rowling just can’t leave it alone. This is not necessarily a bad thing – fans have got to see Harry and friends all grown-up in the Cursed Child plays – but she also managed to muddy the waters by her constant rejigging of the original narrative furniture. The latest act of retroactive continuity (or “retcon” as it become known) to the source material comes via the final trailer for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald , which confirmed that the mysterious character played by Korean actress Claudia Kim is in fact Nagini, the same Nagini who was Lord Voldemort right-hand-snake in the original books and film series. JK Rowling defends decision to cast South Korean actor as Nagini in Fantastic Beasts The deadly viper was always believed to be just that – or rather, Rowling never provided any further backstory to the snake until now, even though she said on Twitter that she been sitting on this secret for years . Now we’re told that Nagini was originally a woman trapped as a snake because of a blood curse passed down through her maternal family line. There been much discussion on social media over this revelation, accusing the author of racism. Some aren’t happy with the optics of a woman of colour playing a character who ends up being subservient to a villain inspired by Nazism, others are frustrated that Rowling has attributed Nagini name to Indonesian instead of Indian mythology and cast a Korean actress in the role as though eastern ethnic minorities are interchangeable. This latter point seems fairer than the former, as anyone who has read the Harry Potter books or seen the films knows that Voldemort treats everyone, of every creed, like servants, but that Nagini is held in highest regard. Even Dumbledore recognised this in the Half-Blood Prince when, speaking of Voldemort and Nagini relationship, he tells Harry: “I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything.” So the idea that Rowling is a racist for making Nagini a woman of colour seems well off court. If anything, the retcon has a more sizeable effect on Neville Longbottom. His heroic defeat of the snake in The Deathly Hallows , by chopping off her head to destroy the Horcrux inside, is lessened now that we know that Nagini was a human all along. As Nagini was a victim to a curse not of her own making, then her murder, despite her evil wrongdoing, seems less justified. And this is the problem: by constantly meddling with her original source material, mostly to make it seem more diverse, Rowling is setting herself up for criticism. Harry Potter might be one of the most universally beloved book series but in hindsight it hardly the most progressive; Rowling has been trying to score woke points ever since. Her tweet revelations have even earned a running joke on social media about how she comes up with progressive additions to her predominantly cisgender and white characters. Fantastic Beasts why can't they just let Dumbledore be gay? The most famous of these character tweaks came in when she confirmed that Albus Dumbledore was gay. Many in the LGBTQ community felt validated by the confirmation but others were rightly sceptical . If the Hogwarts headteacher was gay why was it never mentioned in any of the seven books or eight films? And what does that say about Dumbledore, that he was himself a progressive individual who believed in equality for all, but his own sexuality was closeted from the people around him? It doesn’t do his character any favours. Rowling has promised that the Fantastic Beasts films will explore Dumbledore homosexuality and the final trailer certainly hints at that. But surely it would make more sense for Rowling to come up with new characters instead of retroactively correcting narrative missteps. That way, the integrity of the Harry Potter books remains intact, Rowling no longer has to claim every narrative decision was anticipated years ago, and fans from all backgrounds can enjoy the new movies while feeling represented.

4,"The actor and activist Rose McGowan has issued an apology to Asia Argento after the latter threatened legal action over what she termed “horrendous lies” in connection with sexual assault allegations made against Argento by the actor Jimmy Bennett. In a statement posted on Twitter , McGowan said an earlier statement she had made about the allegations “contained a number of facts that were not correct” and that she “deeply regret[ted] not correcting my mistake sooner and apologise to Asia for not doing so”. McGowan said that her most “serious” mistake was to allege that Bennett had sent explicit text messages to Argento when he was years old and that Argento had not acted appropriately on receiving them. McGowan said she had “misunderstood the messages that Asia exchanged with my partner Rain Dove”. Argento had on September given McGowan hours to apologise before, the following day , saying she had instructed lawyers Mishcon de Reya to “seek substantial damages for deception, fraud, coercion and libel”. However, Argento appears to have accepted McGowan apology, posting a message on Twitter in response reading : “Although I am grateful to @ rosemcgowan for her full apology following her groundless allegations about me, if she had issued it earlier, I may have kept my job on X-Factor and avoided the constant accusations of paedophilia which I have been subjected to in real-life and online.” Argento then followed it up by posting: “Now go on, live your life and stop hurting other people, will you Rose? Best wishes.” The confrontation between two prominent figures in the Harvey Weinstein scandal arose after Argento was accused of sexual assault by actor Jimmy Bennett in a New York Times article in August . Bennett claimed she had paid him to keep the accusation quiet. Argento has denied the assault allegation , and claims her then partner Anthony Bourdain paid the money to Bennett to help him with “severe economic problems”. McGowan first responded to the Argento accusation on August, writing “my heart is broken”. Her statement to which Argento refers was issued seven days later. Police in Los Angeles are investigating Bennett claim after it emerged no report to police had been made at the time of the alleged assault in Argento and Bennett had met after working together on The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things , her adaptation of the JT LeRoy novel.",397,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/28/rose-mcgowan-apology-asia-argento
5,"Judi Dench has defended disgraced actor Kevin Spacey , saying she “can’t approve” of the way he was removed from the recent Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, about the J Paul Getty III kidnap, and replaced with Christopher Plummer. Speaking to journalists at the San Sebastian film festival , where she received a lifetime achievement award, Dench said Spacey was “a good friend” and had been an “inestimable comfort” and “kept me going” while they worked together on The Shipping News after the death of her husband Michael Williams in Dench said: “I can’t approve, in any way, of the fact that – whatever he has done – that you then start to cut him out of the films … Are we to do that throughout history? Are we to go back throughout history and anyone who has misbehaved in any way, or who has broken the law, or who has committed some kind of offence, are they always going to be cut out? Are we going to extrude them from our history?” She added: “I don’t know about the conditions of it, but nevertheless he is, and was, a most wonderful actor. I can’t imagine what he is doing now.” Los Angeles authorities recently dropped a sexual assault claim against Spacey, saying it was outside the statute of limitations; however a number of other alleged offences against the actor are still under investigation , including three by police in London.",245,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/26/judi-dench-rails-against-kevin-spacey-extrusion-from-history
6,"Sydney Theatre Company did nothing for months after an actor had an off-the-record conversation in a bar claiming colleague Geoffrey Rush had behaved inappropriately towards her, a judge has been told. It didn’t investigate or take any other action until STC executive director Patrick McIntyre was approached by a reporter one-and-a-half years later, Rush lawyer Sue Chrysanthou said on Wednesday. She was opposing an application by the STC to set aside parts of a subpoena issued by the actor legal team in his federal court defamation lawsuit against the Daily Telegraph and reporter Jonathon Moran. Daily Telegraph allegations 'motivated to harm' Geoffrey Rush, lawyers argue Rush is suing over November articles about allegations he behaved inappropriately toward fellow cast member Eryn Jean Norvill, who played Cordelia in the STC production of King Lear in and The actor says the articles’ defamatory meanings include a suggestion his alleged misconduct was so serious that the STC changed its human resources policy and resolved never to work with him again. But Chrysanthou said the source of this claim was McIntyre, who made an off-the-record and not-to-be-attributed comment to Moran in November but told him he could publish it. No documents about this STC decision had been produced and Rush legal team believe the statement was false and “there was never any such decision”. Actor gives statement saying Geoffrey Rush touched her inappropriately Further, no documents had been produced showing Norvill made a formal complaint to the STC. “The only thing was a conversation between Eryn Norvill and two people from the STC in a bar in April she said. An email dated April had been produced about the conversation but there was “nothing whatsoever” to show any response by McIntyre. “As far as we can see, Mr McIntyre did nothing,” she said. No investigation was held, no formal reporting of the complaint was made and Rush was not consulted. “All we have from Mr McIntyre is one-and-a-half years later after Mr McIntyre has received queries from the media.” Justice Michael Wigney rejected the STC contention that some parts of the subpoena, including documents relating to the company human resources policies, would be irrelevant to the case.",363,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/26/theatre-company-knew-of-geoffrey-rush-misconduct-claim-and-did-not-act-court-hears
7,"The winner: The House With a Clock in Its Walls The robustly reliable family market propelled the latest production from Steven Spielberg Amblin Entertainment to the top of the UK box office, with for the weekend period for The House With a Clock in Its Walls , and including previews from the previous Saturday and Sunday. Local distributor Entertainment One should be content with that result. The film faced the challenge of a certificate, which might have put off some families with younger children. However, a cast including Jack Black and Cate Blanchett, with Eli Roth in the director chair, might have helped to position the film more appealingly for an adult audience. Source material is John Bellairs’ novel of the same title – the first in a series of books featuring the orphan Lewis Barnavelt. The film opened in the US with so the UK number is in line with that outcome. Recent Amblin productions include Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Ready Player One, The Post, A Dog Purpose and The BFG. The last of those titles seems the most relevant yardstick for this new film, but the huge local popularity of author Roald Dahl invalidates the comparison. The BFG began in the UK with in July The runner-up: A Simple Favour Recent commercial precedents for a darkly comic missing-person thriller are difficlut to pinpoint, and director Paul Feig is best known for pure comedies featuring Melissa McCarthy , so the commercial outcome for his A Simple Favour was hard to call. Lead actor Anna Kendrick is relatively unproved outside the Pitch Perfect franchise, and co-star Blake Lively remains best known for TV Gossip Girl. Given these factors, distributor Lionsgate should easily be happy with a opening, and including previews. The film is based on a novel by Darcey Bell, and Lionsgate was happy to push any associations with Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train – differently toned films adapted from bestsellers with female-skewing audiences. A Simple Favour was never going to perform at the level of those two hits. It faced competition for its date-night adult audience from Crazy Rich Asians, with which it shares its leading man, Henry Golding. Crazy Rich Asians dropped for second-weekend takings of and a total after days of The disappointment: Mile Director Peter Berg has built a steady partnership with actor Mark Wahlberg since producing a trio of muscular films based on real-life events: Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon and Patriots Day.

But if the response of UK audiences is representative, sequels now appear unlikely.

The film maxed out at an uninspiring at US cinemas following its mid-August release.

In fact, Disney Christopher Robin , Incredibles and Hotel Transylvania A Monster Vacation delivered the strongest holds of any major titles.

These numbers are not adjusted for inflation, so – in reality – The Predator is behind the pace of its franchise predecessor.

11,"he surprising presence of two thrillers at the Toronto film festival featuring women in the lead role of detective underlines how rare such films are. Destroyer and Out of Blue represent a pair of refreshing entries to a male-dominated genre. But this shortage isn’t just a symptom of good old-fashioned Hollywood sexism – it also seems to have its roots in a deeper, more complex apprehension. The movie detective is so popular because it a character trope centred on transgressions – try to count them, and you’ll soon note many more bad cops than good ones. It excites us to see a character do things society does not allow; when they can justify this violence with claims of a higher purpose – justice, for instance, or protecting innocent people – it is exhilarating. Films about bad cops often push this logic to its breaking point, forcing us to wonder if the end really justifies the means . Out of Blue review – Carol Morley conjures a cosmically uncanny noir In Dirty Harry, Clint Eastwood Harry Callahan successfully stops some bank robbers from fleeing the scene of the crime, but not without killing two of them in the process. We can judge and reprimand him for those deaths – and for risking the lives of civilians by opening fire in public – but also absolve him because he put his life on the line. At the end of the day, he did his job, and saved innocent lives. The character is so alluring precisely because of this fragile sliver of righteousness. Similarly in Karyn Kusama Destroyer , washed-up detective Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman) does not hesitate to start shooting at bank robbers, endangering everyone in the building. Seeing a woman in the role of the jaded and aggressive cop who refuses to play by the book still feels startling – Sandra Bullock turn in Murder by Numbers as a promiscuous detective with a distaste for authority comes to mind, but that was years ago. And when a badass female detective does appear, she will tend to differ in one key way from her male peers: while the wayward methods of Dirty Harry and the rest are accepted as simple character trait, a female detective rebellious attitude often stems from some past trauma. Elisabeth Moss cop in the TV series Top of the Lake , for example, attacks a man with a glass bottle not out of bloody-minded vigilantism but because he was one of her rapists. In Out of Blue Patricia Clarkson aloof toughness is linked to an ordeal from her childhood. In that regard, Kidman cop in Destroyer represents a leap forward. “Don’t make excuses for what you want. It weak,” she says, and the realisation that she behaved as she did simply because she wanted to is chilling. But she remains an outlier. Why this need to justify female detectives’ violent impulses? Besides the fact that it is another way of stripping female characters of agency – instead of acting on their environment, they are reacting to it – this tendency seems to go hand-in-hand with an anxiety around motherhood. Protection through violence and maternal affection are two concepts at odds with each other, and which Hollywood often puts together for thrilling effect – usually in the story of a mother vendetta. In Kidnap , Halle Berry becomes an action hero in a split second, running after the criminals who have her son. In Peppermint , Jennifer Garner turns into a killing machine after the murders of her husband and daughter. Uma Thurman Bride vows to Kill Bill , the man responsible for the death of her unborn child. The Equalizer: why have Hollywood vigilantes gone soft? In other cases, the maternal instinct kicks in as a plot twist. Taraji P Henson Proud Mary is a hitwoman who isn’t so proud and detached after all, becoming the protector of a young boy after she kills his father. Kathleen Turner tough private investigator VI Warshawski finds herself befriending the daughter of her murdered boyfriend. By contrast, the parental instincts of male detectives tends to be immaterial. When they are fathers, they are usually held to much lower standards of parenthood than their female counterparts. In Heat , Al Pacino Lt Vincent Hanna is too busy chasing after bank robbers to participate much in family life. Yet his shortcomings are forgotten when he dramatically saves the young step-daughter who has attempted suicide. That his emotional neglect may have played a part in the girl desperation and that his absence directly led to her mother spending the evening with another man is conveniently forgotten. Female detectives rarely have it so easy – although Prime Suspect has the merit of standing by Helen Mirren Jane Tennison even once she “fails” as a wife and mother. When her husband leaves her because she is too obsessed with her work, the problem clearly isn’t her dedication but his sexist expectations. In Out of Blue, Patricia Clarkson Mike Hoolihan seems perfectly happy living alone with her cat (even if motherhood is central to her reckoning with the past). Neither need to be redeemed by maternal principles. Destroyer pushes this feminist idea to an almost uncomfortable extreme. Kidman hard-boiled detective isn’t too busy to be a good, nurturing mother. Rather, she simply fails at being one. She loves her daughter and has the skills to protect her, but she cannot take care of her in the day-to-day. It in her character; she is the Destroyer. Feminism isn’t just about letting women be bad – it is also about accepting that they can be bad mothers. Destroyer screens at the London film festival on October and is released in the US on Christmas day.

12,"enry Cavill is Superman no more, and that probably isn’t such a bad thing. The story behind his departure – whether he jumped or whether he was pushed – is bound to come out in good time, but for now please join me in not mourning the end of his mute, grumpy, murderous emo nightclub bouncer tenure. Instead, let look to the future. Superman is bound to be recast, because this is and the notion of dormant intellectual property has long since ceased to exist, so the best we can do is lazily speculate who’ll come next. Fortunately for all of you, I have some suggestions. Ryan Gosling You’d imagine that Ryan Gosling has to be near the top of most Superman wish lists. He tall, he smooth and – as Only God Forgives proved – he can do quite a lot with barely any dialogue if that the route Warner Bros still want. However, two things stand in his way. First, Gosling best performances tend to have a slight ironic remove, which wouldn’t work if he playing a pure-hearted hero. And, second, why the hell would he want to play Superman? Henry Cavill to stop playing Superman, reports suggest Armie Hammer Perhaps instead Warner Bros will revisit the DC logbooks and hire Armie Hammer , the man who was scheduled to play Batman in George Miller aborted Justice League movie. He’d be a terrific Superman, too. In Mirror Mirror , he demonstrated a level of bovine gormlessness that could easily be recalibrated into Superman iron-clad sincerity – except for a couple of things. First, Hammer used Call Me By Your Name to pivot away from dumb blockbusters. And second, why the hell would he want to play Superman? Michael B Jordan Apparently, Jordan has emerged as the frontrunner to take over from Cavill, and for good reason. He probably the most respected actor to have one foot firmly in superhero territory. In Black Panther , he achieved the impossible by helping to create a memorable Marvel villain. In Chronicle he all but played Superman, and acquitted himself brilliantly. Sure, his casting would be booed by all the people who wet their knickers over The Last Jedi , but it would be an inspired choice. There still one issue here, though: why the hell would he want to play Superman? Miles Teller Now, bear with me. Think of Miles Teller and there a good chance that you still think of the Esquire feature that repeatedly and convincingly laid out the argument that he was an unstoppable dick. But what if a healthy dose of dickishness is just what Superman needed? Superman biggest problem is his intense blandness. His powers are unbeatable, his intentions never less than utterly pure. He a drag to play and a drag to watch. But what if he was shot through with some of Teller swaggering, slightly unearned confidence? What if there was a Superman movie about Superman letting his Supermanniness go to his head and acting like a bit of a knob? Wouldn’t Miles Teller be good for that? Nicolas Cage The next Superman movie won't be any good, but Cage desperately needs the money Again, Cage came close to playing Superman before, up to the point of performing a costume test for Tim Burton aborted Superman Lives. But that was old Nicolas Cage . That Nicolas Cage made good creative choices. That Nicolas Cage didn’t need the money. The Nicolas Cage we have now, though, makes terrible choices and desperately needs the money, which makes him a compelling choice for Superman. Because the next Superman movie won’t be any good. We know that and Cage knows that, but he’ll take the job anyway because he blew all his money on castles and dinosaur skulls back in the day. And you’d watch a Nicolas Cage Superman film. Of course you’d watch it. Jared Leto Anyone? Hello? No? Oh fine, suit yourselves. Nobody Here a good idea – let just stop making Superman films. Let just come to the agreement that Christopher Reeve was the best Superman, even though two and a half of his four films stank, and draw a line under the whole sorry thing. Let just agree that, while the character worked in the more innocent days of the century, Superman has no place in an age as cynical as this. Anyone making a Superman film now has two choices: compromise the character by making him darker, or stay true to the character and make an anachronism. That a lose-lose decision. Wouldn’t it be better if they just stopped? Wouldn’t it? Imagine how happy we’d all be if they stopped. But they won’t stop, will they, which is why … A cabbage on a stick There. That who should play Superman next.

13,"Henry Cavill is to be dropped as Superman , after failing to agree terms to make an appearance in the upcoming Shazam! film, it has been reported. According to the Hollywood Reporter , Cavill, who played the role three times – in Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League – is no longer in the running as Superman for future outings in the DC Extended Universe. Cavill, reportedly, was unable to find time to appear in Shazam!, the upcoming comic-book movie starring Asher Angel and Zachary Levi, due for release in April However, the suggestion is that this would mean Cavill is no longer able to play Superman, the DCEU next big Superman-related project is Supergirl, which takes place when Superman is a child.

14,"t starting to look as if Brie Larson Captain Marvel will be Marvel considered response to all those critics who complained about the lack of a headlining female superhero in the studio first nine years . Disappointed that Black Widow always has to fight lower-level baddies because she lacks real superpowers? According to Larson in the new edition of Total Film, Carol Danvers will be able to move entire planets. Upset that the Avengers seem to be led by bickering superblokes while the ladies take a back seat? There may never have been a superhero so intrinsically linked to the survival of humanity as Captain Marvel, whom the studio has pitched as Earth best hope in the fight against Thanos (a figure even the Hulk found himself cowering before.) She is even played by an Oscar-winner, just to ensure we are absolutely clear that the half-Kree hero arrival in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a very big deal indeed. All this is as it should be. But is Danvers up to the task? We’ll find out when Captain Marvel is released in March. Set in the it will see the superhero battling to stop Earth invasion by the Skrulls. The arrival on the scene of the nefarious, shapeshifting aliens, a staple of the comics, throws up all kinds of intriguing possibilities for the past, present and future of the MCU, with the knowledge that they have been around for at least two decades, meaning we could be in for some uncomfortable revelations regarding the true identities of some of Earth mightiest heroes. In the comic-book storyline Secret Invasion, several superheroes were revealed to be Skrulls in disguise, including the original Ant-Man, Hank Pym. It more likely, in the event that Marvel chooses to riff on Secret Invasion, that key members of the Avengers will turn out to have been temporarily replaced by Skrulls, rather than being Skrulls all along – otherwise Marvel risks destroying the emotional weight of its recent back catalogue. But that still leaves room for some tantalising revelations – what if some of the superheroes who died at the hands of Thanos in Infinity War were Skrull impostors rather than the real thing? This might not be as outlandish as it sounds. According to Mark Ruffalo in recent comments to the Hollywood Reporter , Marvel is filming that movie still untitled sequel on the fly, not so much reshooting scenes to take account of script changes but treating the movie like a “living organism” that has not yet settled into its final form. It seems likely, then, that there is potential for Infinity War storyline to riff on any Skrull-focused revelations in Captain Marvel. Filming without a final script has led to the downfall of directors even better known than Infinity War Russo brothers in the past. Just ask Peter Jackson, who has been candid about the difficulties he faced shooting the Hobbit trilogy without a full plan in place. The difference with Marvel is that this is a well-oiled, producer-led machine that has now released movies and prides itself on utilising film-makers who can think on their feet. Studio head Kevin Feige clearly has the ability to juggle many balls at once – Marvel has had three movies a year in cinemas for the past two years, all with interlinking narratives. It means that the studio is able to take account of fan criticism at the same time by parachuting in Larson to solve its diversity deficit, as if shifting its feet to change direction at full pelt like an elite footballer riding a tackle. Might Captain Marvel setting even have been inspired by the desire to retrofit the MCU with a diversity upgrade? Placing Danvers’ origins story in the past, at least a decade prior to the first wave of Marvel movies, suggests the studio is constantly working to refine its tangled web of superhero intrigue. If you were left confused by the post-credits scene from Infinity War, in which Samuel L Jackson Nick Fury pages Danvers just before he crumbles into dust, the picture becomes more focused in the new movie. Captain Marvel, we learned earlier this year , was the first superpowered being to come on to Fury radar, the inspiration for SHIELD and The Avengers. So not only has the studio fixed its female superhero problem by making Danvers tougher than the Hulk, Thor and Spider-Man put together, it has effectively retooled its entire cinematic universe to place the new arrival on a central plinth in the Marvel pantheon – standing so tall there can be no suggestion she might be just a diversity-fuelled afterthought. That a magic trick Doctor Strange himself would be proud of.",784,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/13/captain-marvel-cinematic-universe-diversity-brie-larson
15,"razy Rich Asians opens with Napoleon Bonaparte and Louis Vuitton. “Let China sleep,” the film quotes the great Frenchman saying, “for when she awakens she will shake the world.” An opulent London hotel refuses to honour Singaporean matriarch Eleanor Young reservation, as her children slump across their LV suitcases, suggesting perhaps she might be happier somewhere in Chinatown. An enraged Young, played by Michelle Yeoh , makes one phone call to her husband, who buys the hotel – an act that has been hailed as Asian empowerment. We never see nor hear from Young husband, whose sole function seems to be the revenge purchasing of hotels, again. But many more vignettes of ostentatious acquisition and wealth follow. Even the pet dogs are called Astor and Rockefeller . In a recent op-ed, Thomas Friedman , the New York Times columnist, noted that he “really enjoyed” Crazy Rich Asians because “it reminded me of an important point: Rich Asia has gotten really rich”. Friedman declared after a trip to India that the world was becoming flat, or in other words, as rich as his own plutocratic circles – which includes Mohamm ed bin Salman , crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who is reported to have recently dropped on a Da Vinci . Perhaps Friedman flat-world delusion helps understand how Crazy Rich Asians can be seen as a film about Asian empowerment. For the film, which has crossed the mark, and has enjoyed the highest opening for a romantic comedy in three years, and is indeed funny and charming in parts, is best described as a celebration of transnational plutocracy. Some Asian Americans, for so long either invisible or caricatured by Hollywood, have welcomed Crazy Rich Asians for its representation of a minority. Though it is the monoculture of capitalism, not Asia, that is on display. In fact, “ Asia ” is used in Crazy Rich Asians in the same manner that many westerners employ “ Africa ”, lumping together countries with distinct cultures, languages, and histories. The film map of the continent names only four countries: Singapore, India, China, and Thailand. As for south Asians , who make up a substantial part of Singapore population, I counted only four: one Sikh man at a hawker centre, the rest employed as guards. Asianness is mere window dressing, satisfied by cliched heaps of familial guilt, food shots, and gossipy society ladies. But the film codes, signs and symbols actually belong to capitalism and its new elite. There are the plummy British boarding school accents, couture gowns, first-class cabins and hot bods. Bollywood , the largest film industry in the world, embraced this nouveau-riche aesthetic a good years ago, replacing the downtrodden hero who grows up sleeping on footpaths with urban banker-dreamboats who drive Ferraris in London and yank off their shirts to reveal glistening six packs. ‘It not a movie, it a movement’: Crazy Rich Asians takes on Hollywood Interestingly, Crazy Rich Asians has no main white speaking parts. The only white characters to be are given dialogue – the hotel staff at the very start of the film – expose themselves as racists. This might appear to give the film a political edge – an interpretation encouraged by the film makers and promoters. “It not a movie, it a movement,” director Jo n M Chu has said. But unbridled wealth can’t be a leader for any worthwhile mass movement. Its excesses, in cinema at least, lend themselves best to the sort of scathing treatment given by The Godfather II, the greatest ever meditation on American capitalism, and American Psycho, by far the sharpest film about the crazy rich. Crazy Rich Asians isn’t the first film of its type to be released by a major Hollywood studio. Remember that Sex and the City in which Carrie and the girls romped through “Abu Dhabi” in designer heels and, inexplicably, turbans, was released in – a mere two years after the financial crash. “How do we tip in Abu Dhabi?” Charlotte asks as they arrive at their palatial hotel. “Have ya got any loose rubies?” Carrie replies. It is clearer today that to be “crazy rich” at a time of catastrophic inequality is not a victimless crime. The world richest have seized twice as much growth as the bottom according to World Inequality Report authored by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and others. Until this year, India had the world largest population of poor people, and of China population survives on just over a day (Crazy Rich Asians isn’t being released in either country even though China is the second-largest box office market in the world). Singapore itself struggles with inequality and political disaffection. What are the crazy rich Asians doing about the downtrodden and left-behind in their midst? Nothing, it would seem. Microfinance receives a cameo mention in Crazy Rich Asians, albeit via a Thai princess who for some unexplained reason is writing papers on the subject; Myanmar is referenced only in relation to its rubies; and Rachel Chu, the non-rich love interest ( played by Constance Wu ), is a professor of economics at NYU, but these are the sole references to the existence of the Free markets were promised as the rising tide that would lift all boats, but revolts against globalisation reveal that only the superyachts of the global rich have been lifted while a vast majority struggles to stay afloat in leaking rafts. Hollywood has played an crucial role in defanging crazy rich westerners: billionaire Bruce Wayne is a civil saviour, Daddy Warbucks saves sad orphans, Christian Grey is an irresistible charmer. Hollywood turned “show me the money” into a feelgood mantra – and how cute were those shopaholics in Clueless ? To be extra safe in its sanitising of the ultra-wealthy, Hollywood now lets members of minorities play them in box-office-busting films.

16,"illy Liar always was a great night out. “A brand new kind of escapist entertainment,” the trailer blared when the film was released in But the escape it most literally concerned – one in which a northern funeral clerk might jump on a train and make it as a London scriptwriter – wasn’t then so far fetched. Adapted from his own novel by Keith Waterhouse, it arrived in a Britain giddy on the Beatles and grammar school upstarts like Billy. Social mobility brought the film to life. While director John Schlesinger was solidly Hampstead, Waterhouse was a dropout from Osmondthorpe Council School, Leeds, and star Tom Courtenay the son of a Hull dockworker. As the box office boomed, a daydreamer might have conjured up a British film industry filled with working-class actors and writers, maybe even directors and producers, too. Of course – spoiler warning – Billy never caught the train. The apparent golden age of social mobility would quickly sputter out. And the idea of this class calling the shots in British cinema? Rarely more than fantasy. Now, the mood is darker. In it can be hard finding working-class talent exerting any influence in the creative space of British film. Even the actors are vanishing. “We have got a big problem,” Equity president Maureen Beattie said recently of the lack of opportunities for working-class performers. Actors including Maxine Peake and Lesley Manville appeared at the BFI this spring to publicly highlight the crisis. Drama has been cut from the classroom, young actors priced out of training, a glum contest among those who remain for dwindling roles as gang members and sex workers. But actors are just part of an ecosystem. They can only play roles created by writers for films made by directors. And the story of working- class screenwriters is another with a glorious future behind it – the postwar era that produced Waterhouse also witnessed the black precision of Harold Pinter and the singular vision of Shelagh Delaney , writer of A Taste of Honey , finder of wonder in back streets and bedsits. It worth pausing just to consider how unlikely it would now be for a major British film to be written by a young woman from Salford with no university education. Class in is hard to define but harder to address. Even discussing the most straightforward socioeconomic measure – how closely an industry reflects the national baseline of of the population attending private school – causes fluttering unease. Still, the scale of the problem can be glimpsed in the origins of five current directors who have scaled British cinema to win regular big-budget studio projects: Matthew Vaughn, Guy Ritchie, Tom Hooper, Sam Mendes and Christopher Nolan . All were privately educated. Parity in terms of class – let alone representation of women and people of colour – would require there were other directors of a similar standing who went to state schools. Feel free to start counting. Of course, British directors from working-class backgrounds make high‑profile films. Just not many – and these success stories tend to come with caveats. Danny Boyle made his first feature, Shallow Grave , nearly years ago. Steve McQueen will open the London film festival in October with his much-anticipated thriller Widows , but his route from the London suburb of Hanwell to the red carpet came via the art world, which, like theatre, is more meritocratic than British film. And then there is Lynne Ramsay . For a director in a landscape of limited chances, the reward can be whispering campaigns. Ramsay, whose mother was a cleaner in Glasgow, acquired a reputation as difficult and volatile and all the other codewords used for working-class women who have an opinion. Her last film, the astonishing crime drama You Were Never Really Here , was wildly praised. It was also only her fourth feature film in nearly two decades. Move through the ranks of the business – past the actors, writers and directors – and eventually you reach the producers, development executives, the heads of production companies and funding bodies. Here at last are the decision-makers who shape everything British you see on a cinema screen. Socio-economically, it is a group drawn from the same pool as so many of our MPs, lawyers and journalists. It was ever thus and the didn’t change it. Legally, class is not a “protected characteristic” in the labour market – but then film is mostly lawless anyway, filled with opaque hiring practices and internships for those whose bills are paid by other means. From script readers up, the result has been a highly specialised gatekeeper class taking charge of endless safety-first development streams. Presented with working-class experiences, its members might just as well be listening to Finnish. The issue is not only people having a fair shot at the top jobs in British film; also at stake are the films that never get made. A defining feature of the working-class moment was youth – Delaney co-wrote the screenplay for A Taste of Honey at The tradition endured: Ramsay was when she made her first feature Ratcatcher , Shane Meadows at the time of his, Small Time . Now, the industry risk aversion would slow any young film-maker – but the particular discomfort with these kinds of voices means an extra long spell in limbo. Director Deborah Haywood was before she made her debut feature, this summer brilliantly off-kilter portrait of smalltown England, Pin Cushion . Colin O’Toole, winner of the Bafta for best British short with the tightly wound Cowboy Dave , is already with a string of other shorts behind him. Meadows, by the way, effectively left British film in favour of TV years ago. Ramsay acquired a reputation as volatile, and all the other code words for working-class women with an opinion While it felt reasonable to hope that iPhones and YouTube – or at least cheap cameras and Vimeo – would provide cinema with a new generation of ordinary hotshots, the reality has been patchy. Gifted young directors have appeared online, many either working class or dealing with working-class life – Cecile Emeke, Aaron Dunleavy, Kibwe Tavares, Emma Gilbertson. But a well‑signposted bridge has yet to open between online creativity (nimble, democratic) and British cinema (nervous, arthritic). In class definitions are works in progress, old touchstones such as university degrees less meaningful, race and gender recognised as central. But to get lower-class characters on to a big screen, the safest bet remains being Ken Loach. Thank God for him – few directors have his heft, or could have made a film as vital as I, Daniel Blake . Things only get tricky when the industry sees Loach as a ticked box, apparently believing working-class people exist in a state of gritty social realism the way children think Victorians lived in black and white. Loach has always been more subtle than that. But what are missing are emotionally complex films about people who just happen to work in call centres – one exception that proves the rule is Debbie Tucker Green Second Coming , about a working-class black family touched by metaphysics. Most working-class people are neither thugs nor saints but as mixed-up as the average executive – and the best films hold two thoughts at once. Billy Liar was an absurdist frolic with a brutal punchline; Ramsay eponymous Morvern Callar a blank young raver from a Scottish supermarket who became the heart of a shimmering Spanish road movie. But it is hard to contain multitudes when working-class lives are treated as a niche. It also defies demographics. With class, the situation has never been one in which a small group of people have been shut out of British film; rather, a small group of people have shut themselves inside it. The consequences ripple through everything from the sniggery classism of Matthew Vaughn Kingsman movies to the British Board of Film Classification awarding a certificate to the recent documentary A Northern Soul (too many “fucks” in the wrong accent) to the very cinemas in which prestige British films typically play, the expanding boutique chains Everyman, Picturehouse and Curzon. Economically, short-term salvation lies in the middle-class pound that extends to wine and gourmet popcorn. But the exclusion of the young, skint and state educated from a mass market art form is a shame – and flatly suicidal in the age of Netflix. If the problem is vast, a mirror of the whole British class system, it is also deceptively simple. People like to see people like themselves on screen and be able to afford a ticket. The prize for the solution could be just as huge – a plausible future for a British industry now clinking glasses as the iceberg looms The BFI Working Class Heroes season at the Southbank, London begins tonight. bfi.org.uk.",1471,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/08/no-room-at-the-top-where-are-cinemas-few-working-class-stories-
17,"owards the end of Desiree Akhavan incendiary sophomore feature, The Miseducation of Cameron Post , Chloë Grace Moretz central character attacks the anti-LGBT Christians running the conversion therapy camp where she is living for the emotional abuse inherent in “programming people to hate themselves”. She has spent months encased in the world of the God Promise camp, in which homosexuality is euphemistically referred to as “SSA” (same-sex attraction) and the residents are called “disciples”. Akhavan film is an angry depiction of a Christianity that is openly hostile to anyone whose sexuality sits contrary to the notion of the traditional nuclear family and, with that, it joins the ranks of a movie canon that positions religion squarely as an antagonist. At the beginning of the year, Greta Gerwig Lady Bird focused on the title character struggles at a Catholic school in The structures and prejudices of that environment fuel her disdain for her hometown and her sense of rebellion against a world in which the refrain of “six inches for the Holy Spirit” separates amorous couples at a high school dance. For Gerwig and Akhavan, these stories hark back to their own days of youthful fightback in the and A new generation of film-makers are turning their eyes, and their poisonous pens, against the prejudices of their earlier lives – prejudices fuelled by religion. Britain has its own analogue to this duo in Manchester-born auteur Daniel Kokotajlo . He made his feature debut this year with Apostasy – a tale inspired by his own upbringing as a Jehovah Witness. It a moving story that sees a family of three torn apart by the fundamentalist restrictions of their religion, with one daughter “disfellowshipped” when she becomes pregnant by her college boyfriend, and the other struggling with the Damocletian peril of a dormant blood disorder that could kill her if she follows the church doctrine and refuses a transfusion. Apostasy director: ‘It was liberating to leave the Jehovah Witnesses’ Apostasy, perhaps by virtue of its director background, is a more even-handed depiction of religion than either Cameron Post or Lady Bird. The faith of the Witnesses is not positioned as irrational, but is clearly marked as antagonistic, with the patriarchal leadership ruling that mother Ivanna – played with heartbreaking tenderness by Siobhan Finneran – can have only minimal contact with her daughter and granddaughter. With Ian McEwan adaptation The Children Act arriving in cinemas last week, it the second film of the year to focus on the strict orthodoxy of Jehovah Witnesses when it comes to blood. That religious double standard – promising love and protection while pushing away those who don’t have absolute faith – is also at the forefront of Paul Schrader First Reformed . Developing its “male loner on a moral crusade” themes from Schrader own script for Taxi Driver, it a movie that sees Ethan Hawke as a reverend whose increased awareness of eco-activist concerns leads to a crisis in his faith, particularly when he discovers his historic church parent organisation takes large amounts of money from an environmentally sketchy energy company. Schrader evokes the uneasy dynamic between religion, money and power in a way that casts the reverend as a self-destructive avenger figure, right up until the finale. That uneasy power dynamic brings it back to The Miseducation of Cameron Post. When Moretz title character takes her stand, it because the teachings and pressures imposed by God Promise have led to something horrific happening to one of the camp residents. This camp is a world from which it is seemingly impossible to escape, as those with power over these children – their parents, schools, etc – are complicit in sending them to be “fixed” and changed in the name of the norms imposed by their religions. The Jehovah Witness characters in Apostasy, and the students of the Catholic school in Lady Bird , would be able to sympathise with that. All of these films feel particularly vital given the prominence of religious values in political regimes on both sides of the Atlantic. In America , Donald Trump most polemic rhetoric has a quasi-religious feel and his administration publicly sided with the Christian baker Jack Phillips , who refused to bake a custom wedding cake for a gay couple. In Britain, Theresa May father was a vicar and her Christianity is something she has never shied away from in her political career. She used her most recent Christmas message to declare that the UK should “take pride in our Christian heritage” and defend the “values” of the faith. Against this backdrop, these movies serve as a fervent, rage-filled counterpoint from liberal film-makers to the rightwing rhetoric, fuelled by religion, that is dominant in western politics in – despite increasingly secular societies. For a whole generation of young directors – and at least one renowned veteran in Schrader – the biggest movie bogeyman of is the power of fundamentalist religion.",820,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/04/the-movie-bogeyman-of-the-year-fundamentalist-religion
18,"he question of how to approach human suffering on camera has confounded film-makers for decades. There no blueprint when it comes to turning news stories into cinema, and while the likes of Schindler List and Years a Slave have been praised for providing insight into historical atrocities, in recent years, attention has turned to events that are fresh in our collective memory. In many cases, this means acts of terrorism. The events of became the narrative of United and World Trade Center in while the Boston Marathon bombing inspired Patriots Day and Stronger It human nature to want to make order out of chaos, and these films speak to a collective yearning for answers and understanding in the aftermath of tragedy. Yet the question remains: are films based on real-life terrorist attacks opportunistic? This year sees the release of two films which centre on the attack in Norway by rightwing extremist Anders Behring Breivik, which left people dead, of whom were teenagers. Erik Poppe Utøya–July debuted at the Berlin film festival in February, while Paul Greengrass July will be screened at the Venice film festival this week. Poppe worked closely with survivors from Utøya island, using their testimonies to create a real-time, single-take thriller in which Breivik is a shadowy figure in the film periphery. Meanwhile, Greengrass film focuses on both the attack itself, and its aftermath as, as the Toronto film festival states , “the Norwegian justice system [is] forced to deal with an extremist beyond anything it has ever encountered”. As writer and philosopher Susan Sontag stated in her essay Regarding the Pain of Others, “One can feel obliged to look at photographs that record great cruelties and crimes. One should feel obliged to think about what it means to look at them, about the capacity actually to assimilate what they show.” We could see these films in a similar manner – to watch them is to view the real-life events at a distance, but to be jolted by our voyeurism. The events of July will still be fresh in the memory of many, given the media coverage that surrounded both the attack and Breivik trial. Internet access has created an inescapable news cycle, and for many, particularly those living in Europe , the Norway attack was a particularly shocking incident. It has taken seven years for these twin feature films to materialise, which could be seen as a cynical attempt at turning human suffering into box office returns. Questions arise around the ethics of this particular docudrama style of film-making – what can a film based on real events tell us that documentary footage or eyewitness testimony cannot? “The attraction of docudramas is that, more often than not, we [the target audience] are aware of the story,” says Dr Belén Vidal, senior lecturer in film studies at King College London. “Fiction is not the opposite of fact. The moment in which facts begin to circulate they are already turned into narrative, whether as news reports or amateur video uploaded onto YouTube. We make sense of events through storytelling.” Certainly narratives do not exist in cinema alone – from verbal accounts to written articles, they are our way of absorbing and processing information. What we choose to include and exclude, even in something as simple as an anecdote we recount to our friends, is important – and in the case of Poppe and Greengrass, every narrative decision impacts the authenticity of their films. It is up to viewers to digest and question these decisions, and indeed the nature of docudrama as an art form. Graphic violence is often seen as a mainstay of pop culture, but there is a fine line between authenticity and gratuitousness when it comes to docudrama. “The best docudramas engage in a quest for understanding: on a experiential level, on a social level, on a political level too,” says Vidal. “They are indicative of how a society or nation works through trauma. Their potential value resides in that they express a point of view.” Utøya, the island paradise turned into hell by Anders Behring Breivik We might view these films then as social documents intended to aid our collective understanding, not only of human nature and society, but of narrative art itself. The stories we tell ourselves are a sort of armour against future anguish – a form of collective memory, by which we process what we struggle most to understand. But film-makers must exercise caution when treading this delicate ground, it not enough to have noble intentions. In making sense of human cruelty, these films should seek to say something more than simply recalling newsreels, lest docudramas become ghoulish spectacles of suffering. July is released on Netflix on October, and Utøya–July is released in the UK on October.",795,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/03/real-life-terror-is-it-exploitative-to-use-human-suffering-for-cinematic-thrills
19,"There is too much of a good thing At the end of with both The Last Jedi and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle packing them in, it seemed like both the Star Wars franchise and The Rock were two of the safest box office bets in Hollywood. In two years, the revival of the space opera series had produced three megahits, including the relative gamble of a spin-off adventure while Dwayne Johnson had somehow managed to turn the sequel to a moderately successful family film into a smash, Sony biggest hit to date. But this summer, audiences turned their back on both. Disney had been spacing out their Star Wars installments by a year but just five months after The Last Jedi, Solo: A Star Wars Story bounded on to screens and the overwhelming response was one of utter fatigue. It limped towards less than globally, a number that particularly problematic given its bloated budget, making it the sixth most expensive film of all time. It led to a reported rethink of the ambitious one-a-year strategy, putting into question just how much of the Star Wars universe people actually care to explore. So long, Solo: how the Star Wars spin-off revealed a dark side to film franchises Later in the summer, Johnson reappeared just three months after his big-budget B-movie Rampage made a solid worldwide (yet with marketing costs on top, it’ll take an estimated two years of home media sales and TV deals to break even). With Skyscraper , he was testing his considerable popularity with his third wide-releasing lead role in just eight months. The ultimate result was rather lukewarm, with the budgeted film making just over half of that in the US and so far failing to cross the barrier worldwide. Both Skyscraper and Solo, while hardly adored by critics, felt like victims of poor scheduling rather than poor quality. Would Solo have performed better if released during the now synonymous Star Wars Christmas period? Maybe. If audiences had to wait more time for another Rockbuster would they have shown more interest in Skyscraper? Possibly. But it clear that neither brand is quite as infallible as many had assumed and expectations should be duly adjusted. Size doesn’t matter Given the deluge of big-budget, action-heavy sequels over the summer period, there remains an audience thirsty for counter-programming. In previous years, Fruitvale Station, Blue Jasmine, Boyhood and Begin Again all succeeded against the odds and while only saw The Big Sick break out, this summer has been a far more rewarding season for indies. After they stumbled with their last low-budget festival-buzzed horror It Comes At Night (which sank on wide release last summer), saw their second-biggest hit to date with Hereditary , a bleak and brutal film that managed to hold its own in an unlikely time of year. The June release has so far made in the US and almost worldwide, an impressive result given its budget and the clear result of almost universal acclaim and a nifty marketing campaign. The indie distributor has also seen coming-of-age comedy Eighth Grade cross the barrier, despite an overly restrictive R rating (something they combatted with special for-all-ages screenings ). How two small documentaries stormed the US box office this summer One genre which saw a major uptick in the warmer months was the documentary. By summer end, three docs have passed apiece in the US, a not-to-be-sniffed-at achievement given that fewer than films have ever managed the same. Why? Well, the success of RBG (about supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) and Won’t You Be My Neighbor? (about much-loved children TV staple Mister Rogers) were seen by many as a response to the increasingly divisive nature of US politics as both praised kind, progressive figures, providing much-needed respite. The third hit, Three Identical Strangers , showed an undying fascination with real-life plot twists, undoubtedly on the increase thanks to a boom in true-crime podcasts and docs on Netflix. Audiences had little time for funny business A summer comedy used to be an easy win, an Apatow hit eventually proving as reliable as a superhero sequel, but the formula has been off of late. While Knocked Up, The Hangover, Bridesmaids, Meet the Millers, Ted, Trainwreck and Spy all coasted past the mark, the last few years have seen stumble after stumble with only Girls Trip managing to land. This summer was another washout with Tag , The Spy Who Dumped Me , Life of the Party and The Happytime Murders all underperforming (the failure of the latter two also putting Melissa McCarthy bankability into serious question). The only bona fide success story of the season is Crazy Rich Asians , which technically falls into the category of romantic comedy rather than a full-blown comedy. But like Girls Trip last year, it a film that taken a familiar concept and given it a much-needed refresh with a diverse cast made up of criminally underused actors and it a lesson execs would be wise to keep in mind going into future summer seasons, the genre in drastic need of an update. Anarchy sells While some aforementioned audience members gravitated to warm-hearted true stories, there were also a couple of anarchic hits that showed that others were thirsty for disarray. Horror prequel The First Purge , the fourth in the patchy yet reliably hard-edged franchise, was the most political entry yet, openly commenting on the fractured state of race relations in the US and coupled with a Trump-baiting marketing campaign, it somehow felt like one of the most timely films of the season. Audiences agreed and it now become the biggest Purge chapter worldwide, with a gross from just a budget. Making America Gory Again: how the Purge films troll Trumpism Boots Riley whipsmart, genre-defying indie satire Sorry to Bother You was a hit with critics on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences (an impressive in the bank to date) and thinkpiece writers (seemingly endless hot takes still dropping) and it easy to see why: his anarchic take on corporate America, race, art and performance felt effortlessly of the moment. Similarly, Spike Lee saw his biggest hit in years with BlacKkKlansman , which might have been set in the but its story about confronting and disassembling white supremacy also struck a chord. On a far different yet still provocative note, Deadpool rebellious response to superhero cinema was also a major draw worldwide). Mission: Impossible is Hollywood most reliable franchise Somehow, the most critically acclaimed blockbuster of the summer is the sixth in a series of films starring an actor whose star has been on the wane. Mission: Impossible – Fallout , landing in cinemas years after the rebooted original, has been heralded by many as a franchise best, a miracle given how malformed the franchise seems on paper with a vacant central character and a constantly shifting plot. Audiences were equally enthused with a global haul in a month (expect that to expand considerably when it hits China on August). It a vital success for Cruise, who struggled to turn The Mummy into the franchise-starter Universal so desperately wanted and whose time as Jack Reacher has come to a merciful end. Given how surprisingly fresh the film felt, it feels like a franchise that has the potential to run on with the inevitable seventh installment feeling like the rare example of a sequel to be excited about. Marvel long game has paid off Given the aggressive conveyor belt of Marvel movies over the past years, it been easy to feel wearied, frustrated and flat-out bored by the procession of interlinked tales thrown our way every few months. But with the release of Avengers: Infinity War , the summer biggest commercial hit, one also feels a begrudging respect for their overarching plan. Unlike the shambles that is the DC universe, there been a careful build to this very moment when all the characters collide for, what will be for many of them a final showdown. The long-serving audience came out in droves, turning the film into the fourth-biggest film of all time globally, and critics were also pleasantly surprised with reviews far stronger than the underwhelming Age of Ultron. There were yet more good news for Marvel, with Ant-Man and the Wasp exceeding its predecessor box office and for now, their position at the top of the food chain remains safe. Never underestimate sharks The box office potential of a film pitting Jason Statham against a prehistoric shark was one of the biggest question marks of the summer, the entire venture sounding like it belonged on a small screen with a tiny budget. But this year B-movie revival (kicked off by pre-summer adventures Rampage and Pacific Rim: Uprising) has matched Syfy channel concepts with blockbuster production costs, something of a gamble for all those involved. Initial tracking was a bit damp for The Meg but on release, it defied expectations and has so far made over worldwide in just two weeks. It the third shark film to over-deliver in a row (The Shallows and Meters Down were also surprise hits), and while Statham would surely like to take credit for such impressive numbers, the everlasting obsession with underwater beasts is most likely the reason. A sequel to Meters Down hits next summer and we’re surely not far away from a reboot of the film that started it all .",1562,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/28/2018-movies-films-best-worst-box-office-performance-summer

Spines bleed … a lot.” Black knew that, as well as Schwarzenegger in his prime and some macho sci-fi action, part of what made the original Predator movie a cult classic was its abundance of “strong bloody violence, language throughout, and crude sexual references”, as the ratings board would put it. It wasn’t exactly PC, but Predator represents a bygone era of ripe, risky, reckless action movies, often dripping with blood, testosterone and cheese but also wildly entertaining. So many enduring classics and guilty pleasures from the were rated R (roughly equivalent to a UK the Predators, Aliens, Terminators, Die Hards, Mad Maxes, First Blood and Rambo, Lethal Weapon (which Black wrote), RoboCop , Total Recall. Their levels of violence and profanity were not exactly laudable, but they were part of what made these movies popular. They reflected a movie scene where Hollywood didn’t have to play it safe and pitch every movie at the broadest possible demographic in order to recoup costs. That what many of the latter-day sequels to these movies did: Alien vs Predator, Live Free Or Die Hard, Terminator: Salvation , the RoboCop reboot – all disappointing, all rated in the UK).

The box-office share of R-rated movies in the US has plummeted from in to below in the However, things started to change in with Deadpool, which became the second highest grossing R-rated movie in US history.

21,"he prospect of Donald Trump: The Movie is as impractical as it is inevitable. Any attempt to squeeze the twists, turns, scandal, farce, outrage and horror of even a single month from the past two years of his presidency, let alone his entire life, into a reasonable runtime would be an effort in hubris. And yet, there is no future in which we aren’t inundated with a number of movies about the life and times of the Donald. Fahrenheit first trailer for Michael Moore Trump documentary Recently, journalist Dan Rather used Twitter to pitch Martin Scorsese as the ideal director for the eventual Trump biopic. Following Rather lead, here is a list of film-makers most likely to take up the challenge, as well as those less likely, but well-suited to the task: Martin Scorsese Rather wasn’t the first person to compare the Trump presidency to a Scorsese movie: the director himself said Trump reminds him of his Gangs of New York villain Bill the Butcher, while many have compared the most recent developments of Robert Mueller investigation to the third act chaos of Goodfellas. While it unlikely Scorsese would ever make a movie explicitly about Trump, it would follow the logical progression of his best-known crime films. From the working-class hustlers of Mean Streets and middle management thugs of Goodfellas, to the millionaire mafiosos of Casino and corporate conmen of Wolf of Wall Street, his films have long traced the ascending arc of greed and power across the American economic divide. It only makes sense that the final entry in this cycle take place within the highest echelons of power. Jay Roach Jay Roach setting his sights on Trump is no hypothetical – the director is currently developing Michael Wolff incendiary tabloid account, Fire and Fury, for television. Although he best known for directing two of the biggest comedy hits of the last years – Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and Meet the Parents – Roach is just as prolific when it comes to telling political stories, like HBO dramas Recount, Game Change and All the Way. If these titles sound familiar, you probably know what to expect from Fire and Fury: spot-on casting and top-shelf production values rendered in the service of entertaining, but ultimately unmemorable re-enactment. Adam McKay McKay has followed a similar career trajectory to Roach, moving from broad, crowd-pleasing comedies like Anchorman and Step Brothers to openly political fare, such as recession drama The Big Short and his upcoming Dick Cheney biography, Backseat. It wouldn’t be surprising if, at some point in the future, he moves his lens (and his artistic ire) from the second George Bush presidency to the Trump administration. Aaron Sorkin It going to happen at some point. Whether it a courtroom drama in the vein of the Social Network, or a fractured biopic like Steve Jobs, you know that Aaron Sorkin #Resistance: The Movie is coming. It coming, and there nothing you can do about it. Expect huffy indignation, smug monologues about the death of civility in America, and hallways. So many hallways. Oliver Stone Much like Sorkin example, an Oliver Stone Trump film seems like a foregone conclusion. It would be surprising if the incorrigible iconoclast didn’t seek to turn his president trilogy – JFK, Nixon, W – into a quartet by way of DJT, especially when you take into account the similarities between the two: both share a taste for conspiracy theories, antipathy for “the Deep State”, and a cozy relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Despite his public criticism of Trump, it stands to reason that his biopic would be one of the more sympathetic films made about the president. The Coen brothers As much as the narrative around Trump often resembles a grand tragedy in the making, it just as often comes off as pitch-black farce. The desperate dimwits, grotesque weirdos and sleazy schlemiels and schlimazels that fill out Trumpworld would feel right at home in Fargo, Burn After Reading or The Hudsucker Proxy, while the shabby criminal enterprises they continuously find themselves undone by are as convoluted as the plot of The Big Lebowski. There nobody better at wrangling this type of hyperreal chaos into something meaningful as Joel and Ethan Coen, even if their miscreants are more lovable, or at least more pitiable, than the likes of Steven Bannon or Anthony Scaramucci. Jody Hill Along those same lines, the films and television series of Jody Hill (Observe and Report, Eastbound &amp; Down, Vice Principals) are master classes in slapstick vulgarity, but unlike the out-of-their-depth reprobates that populate the Coens’ universes, Hill toxic antiheroes tend to reveal themselves as frighteningly capable. Trump doesn’t resemble Kenny Powers in bigotry and crudity alone, but also in his dangerous magnetism and natural cunning. A Hill film (starring Danny McBride as Trump, no doubt) about the era of American carnage would probably be as terrifying as it would hilarious. Mary Harron Canadian film-maker Mary Harron would likewise mine both humor and terror from a Trump biopic, although she would probably lean more towards terror. Harron is expert at telling stories about real-life figures of infamy. While most of her work revolves around notorious women – Betty Page, Anna Nicole Smith, would-be Andy Warhol assassin Valerie Solanas – her best-known film is the adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis American Psycho, which centers around the murderous fantasy life of deranged Wall Street stockbroker/serial killer Patrick Bateman. Bateman is often compared to Trump, which is fitting since Bateman worships Trump in the original novel. But even discarding that piece of trivia, Harron film is a deeply disturbing dissection of unfettered wealth, uncontrollable appetite and masculinity at its most fragile and most dangerous, all of which describes Trump to a capital, gold-plated T. David Lynch Given his devotion to abstract themes and dream logic, David Lynch is the last person who would devote a film to Trump or, for that matter, any political figure (references to Harry S Truman notwithstanding). But thanks to the events of a few months ago, when a quote he gave during an interview was taken out of context and held up as supportive of Trump and his policies (leading Trump to praise Lynch as a “great film-maker” during one of his rallies), the two are now forever linked in the history books. It remains highly unlikely that Lynch would explicitly reference Trump in his next movie (if he even decides to make another one), but that doesn’t mean it might not be about Trump on some level. As an artist, Lynch follows his emotional intuition wherever it takes him, and the outrage and disappointment his comments were initially met with clearly had affected him . It not too much of a stretch to imagine Lynch working all this out on screen, in the process giving us the White House by way of the Black Lodge. Stormy Daniels Laugh if you must, but in addition to her career as an adult actor, Daniels, who allegedly had an affair with Trump when he hosted The Apprentice, is also a director, with more than credits to her name. She wouldn’t be the first director to make the transition from pornography to “legitimate” movies, and there no film-maker on the planet with a more intimate knowledge of Trump at his most unguarded and – literally – naked. Trump: The Movie, if directed by Daniels, would give greater insight into the man psyche than any other film save, perhaps, the one that rumored to be in the hands of the Russian government.",1259,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/27/donald-trump-biopic-who-should-direct
22,"This might come as a shock to regular, sane people who think about the Academy Awards one day a year, but as far as Hollywood is concerned, Oscar season kicks off next week. The Venice film festival, followed in overlapping succession by Telluride and Toronto, is when the studios start showing off their would-be prize ponies: soon we will have verdicts on such prestige prospects as Damien Chazelle Neil Armstrong biopic First Man and Alfonso Cuarón Mexican saga Roma, and the campaigning will begin. For industry folk, it is a nerve-racking few weeks: for every bolt-from-the-blue contender minted in festival season (a Moonlight or a Slumdog Millionaire , say), several high-profile titles that sounded like pure trophy-bait on paper will fall by the wayside. Just ask two-time Oscar-winner Alexander Payne, whose socially conscious Matt Damon fantasy Downsizing was touted as a frontrunner last year – until it opened the Venice festival to mixed reviews that only cooled as time went on. The Academy eventual verdict? Nul points. Payne is in famous company. A few years ago, pundits declared Disney making-of-Mary-Poppins drama Saving Mr. Banks a perfect storm of Oscar-friendly ingredients – Hollywood history! Laughter and tears! Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson! – only for it to land a single nomination for its music score. Angelina Jolie had high hopes for her stodgily “inspirational” second world war survival tale Unbroken – particularly after it somehow struck gold at the US box office – but voters turned their noses up at all but its cinematography and sound effects. Going further back into the hall of failure, you will find such once-touted strikeouts as Mira Nair glumly earthbound aviatrix biopic Amelia; the icky Kevin Spacey karma-drama Pay It Forward; and Brian De Palma egregiously misjudged adaptation of The Bonfire of the Vanities. An excellent podcast, This Had Oscar Buzz, has devoted itself to chronicling such disappointments, and that may be the best remembrance these films can hope for. Who could fall from the plinth this year? It hard to call in advance, but all eyes are on Bradley Cooper unlikely remake of A Star Is Born (currently stoking best actress talk for Lady Gaga, of all people). The likes of Sean Penn and Barbra Streisand have voiced approval from advance insider screenings, but critics might be less bedazzled. And will the upcoming face-off between two recent nominees, Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie, in Mary, Queen of Scots prove to be another Elizabeth … or another Elizabeth: The Golden Age? Soon enough, at least some star players will be muttering the words of Marlon Brando in the (Oscar-winning, thank you very much) classic On the Waterfront: “I coulda been a contender.” Get out your tiny violins.",452,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/27/gong-with-the-wind-the-early-oscar-contenders-that-fall-by-the-wayside
23,"dewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje wrote what became his first film script in the hope it might help him to get a good night sleep. The actor, best known for roles in Lost, Game of Thrones and Suicide Squad , wanted a way to process his painful childhood. Farming – the film, not the occupation – became his therapy. “I think I’d attained a certain amount of success in my career and life, but was plagued by some feelings that I’d not really resolved,” he says. “I used to write at night just to get to sleep, just to let it out of me. By the end of two weeks, I had a manuscript.” Eighteen years later, a film evolved from these reams of writing and premiered to considerable acclaim at the Toronto film festival. It focuses on his life as a boy whose Nigerian parents “farmed” him out to a white, working-class family in Tilbury, Essex, in the hope of giving him a better future. For a while, this “better future” looked less than certain: the area was strikingly white and his new mother was often cruel and unloving. Plagued by self-loathing, Akinnuoye-Agbaje took an unusual route out of isolation: he joined a local gang of racist skinheads. This plot is not the only surprise about Farming. Another is its casting. As the illiterate, emotionally abusive, racially insensitive Essex foster mother of nine, we have … Kate Beckinsale , best known for toned action heroines and withering upper-class comedies. “I still don’t know why Ade cast me,” she says. “It was such an odd move.” “I remember driving to the read-through and thinking: ‘I’m so glad I’m old, because at the beginning of my career I’d be being sick out of the window,’ because everyone else in the film was proper except me. I was the posh girl from Chiswick coming in.” What could have been a gruelling shoot was, says Beckinsale, anything but. “Very low budget, very short amount of time, incredibly ambitious film, fucking tons of kids, could have been a nightmare. I went into it eating lots of chips [she put on weight for the role] and worrying: ‘Oh my God, there going to be nine children in this tiny living room.’ You didn’t know if they were ever going to say their lines, or if they were going to punch you in the face. And they were angels . Unbelievable.” The tiny living room was one of many spaces painstakingly recreated from Akinnuoye-Agbaje childhood home. Such intimacy, says Beckinsale, made both the shoot and the finished product feel unusual. “It was very different from anything else I’ve ever done because you were always aware that this was Ade story and some of it was incredibly upsetting. You felt very privileged to be in this incredibly vulnerable space.” Damson Idris (star of John Singleton TV series Snowfall), who played Akinnuoye-Agbaje teenage self, was shipped off to Tilbury for full immersion. Idris would encourage the actors playing skinheads to hurl abuse at him, fasted on three apples a day to remain lean and called himself racist terms three times in the mirror before each scene. “I tormented myself throughout this movie,” he says. For Akinnuoye-Agbaje, too, the shoot could have been emotionally tough, but budgetary constraints meant there was little time to grieve about the past. And, watching the results, he says was – happily – “surreal but also cathartic”. He and Beckinsale concur that, at its heart, the film is, in her words, “an incredibly fractured love story between mother and adopted son”. “You did get the urge to say this was a villain, given some of the stuff she would say and the way she spoke to the kids,” says Beckinsale. “But if the parent is evil, it almost less damaging because it the ambivalence that so jarring and difficult and really messes up children.” Realising how much of Ingrid behaviour came from ignorance – and the context of the time and place – was key. “She couldn’t read or write, she had no real self-awareness about why she wanted to adopt seven, eight or nine kids. It such an extreme thing to do without self-analysis. She just was going with her instinct,” says Beckinsale. Akinnuoye-Agbaje says he was drawn to Beckinsale for the role, in part because he wanted someone with charisma, a star who could be “a relatable, lovable rogue”. “I wanted to create this fractured, lovable Fagin-esque type of woman because my mother was a product of her time,” he says. “Her ignorance had a real searing impact on me as a child, but I had to address what had created her.” Yes, he says, the film contains a lot of racist abuse – but these were terms normalised by primetime sitcoms of the day. And, yes, Ingrid and women like her were admirable in taking in children from completely different cultures. But: “They didn’t know they had to grease a black child skin because of their ‘ash’ or put oil in their hair. They didn’t know so many things.” As well as mainlining chips, Beckinsale – who specialised in linguistics at university – sought to perfect an authentic Tilbury dialect. She sent Akinnuoye-Agbaje sample clips of accents she had unearthed – none of which he felt were quite right. The accent that finally got the thumbs-up, in fact, was one Beckinsale says she based on “lairy mates”. “Chiswick is very different from Tilbury. But I have been exposed to other types of people,” she explains, grinning. One aspect of Ingrid character she certainly shares is a striking honesty, which she admits hasn’t always served her well, calling it her “least helpful quality”. “I didn’t realise until I got to Hollywood that there was even a possibility that my opinion might be slightly less counted because of being female or being young. And that was really odd. I’ve never gone in anywhere and forced my opinion – but it literally the having of one at all that can be difficult in certain situations.” She refers to the “old misogyny” that she feels continues to pervade the industry. Last year, she shared her story of being greeted by Harvey Weinstein in a bathrobe when she was and the many expletives he fired at her when she turned down future collaborations. “You hear all these things about actresses being ‘difficult’,” she says. “Well, to me, ‘difficult’ is someone who won’t come out of their trailer or who is late or uncooperative or doesn’t know their lines or treats people rudely. Having an opinion and saying, ‘I do think there a problem here’ isn’t difficult. “I’ve worked with quite a few women about whom people have said, ‘Oh, she difficult’ and then I’ve found them actually rather rigorously professional and totally on time and on top of it. So, just as I’d like to get rid of ‘bossy’ for little girls, I’d quite like to get rid of ‘difficult’ for actresses.” Akinnuoye-Agbaje background as an actor helped with on-set shorthand and sympathy. For him, the motivation behind the film wasn’t just personal catharsis – it was also professional opportunity. “There was the creative frustration of not actually getting roles that really explored the layers of who I was as a human being. They were limited to me – as a colour or a size – and I did what I could with those, and injected what humanity I could. But I wasn’t prepared to wait around for the role to come down the pipeline or place my destiny in the hands of an external factor.” His decision to break out on his own seems to have paid off. Soon after the premiere, Farming was picked up by Lionsgate. The early reactions to this intricately personal and specific story have already had a big impact on Akinnuoye-Agbaje. “What [the response] says to me is that we’re all human and the things that our protagonist goes through are just human trials that everyone faces in their own life,” he says. “OK, in the movie, they’re extreme, but it is about triumph over adversity, challenges and obstacles, finding a sense of belonging, finding self-worth, learning how to love one self and these are things that everyone can relate to.”",1378,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/28/kate-beckinsale-on-her-role-in-farming-if-the-parent-is-100-evil-its-almost-less-damaging
24,"o one needs to teach Will Poulter anything about checking his privilege. The career choices of this show an actor drawn to films with a social conscience. In scarcely more than a decade, he has left behind CGI blockbusters ( one Narnia and two Maze Runners ) and broad comedy ( We’re the Millers , in which he snogged Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts, and briefly sported a swollen prosthetic testicle). Instead, he has moved on to more serious, searching projects: the below-the-breadline chamber-piece Glassland , Kathryn Bigelow race riots drama Detroit and now The Little Stranger , a ghost story that twitches with class tension. The Little Stranger review –&nbsp;Ruth Wilson shines in mournful ghost story In person, too, Poulter is constantly checking, unpicking, interrogating and rechecking himself. Five times during the course of our two conversations – first in a Dublin hotel bar a few hours before the premiere of The Little Stranger , then the following day on the phone – he describes himself with an air of contrition as a “white, straight, middle-class male”, careful to the point of fastidiousness that nothing should be omitted or misunderstood. So cards on the table: he was a pupil at the Harrodian School in west London (current fees: upwards of per term), whose alumni also include Robert Pattinson, Jack Whitehall, Tom Sturridge and George Mackay. “What my privilege has meant is that I haven’t experienced the same levels of exclusion and inaccessibility that might come with being working class,” says Poulter, who is tall and trim, with a serious expression, narrowed eyes and a courteous, meet-the-parents air. “I’ve certainly felt guilty about that. But guilt for those less privileged and those who experience the prejudice from which I’m protected isn’t enough. Acknowledgement is the first step in hopefully using your privilege to realise a more equitable society. I’m trying to find ways to deconstruct that hierarchy as opposed to just enjoying the privilege and acknowledging the guilt.” Such as? “I’m keen to develop as an activist and involve myself in charities and organisations. And with my acting, it important that the projects I do have a sociopolitical impact. I try to be conscious about the message. As a white, straight, middle-class male, I’m aware of things I take for granted.” I wonder how it felt to hear Daniel Mays observe, in that the industry was “awash” with privately educated actors , or to read the Sutton report findings that the same group takes a disproportionately high share of awards of British Bafta winners and of British Oscar winners). Is it like being under attack? “No, no. Not at all. I’ve undoubtedly benefited from my middle-class environment. I hold my hands up to that. And I know that unless we try to make pathways into the industry more open and accessible, then we can’t expect it to reflect society.” This is all pertinent to The Little Stranger, in which a doctor (played by Domhnall Gleeson) in Warwickshire is summoned to the country pile he has coveted since childhood. There he finds Roderick, played by Poulter, who suffered severe burns to his face and leg during the war and has grown old prematurely. “He this boy whose youth has been cut short by his injuries so that he almost jumped forward in time to become an old man. He confined to the house, he hitting the bottle, living with all these regrets. There this emotional decay, which is a strange reflection of what happening to the house. He feels intrinsically tied to the state of the home and he is trying, like a lot of the landed gentry, to take pride in its status, just as he does in his own. But there are these parallels of degradation.” His performance in Detroit was in the tradition of great baby-faced monsters: Attenborough in Brighton Rock, David Bennent in The Tin Drum, Cagney in everything Poulter distinctive facial features serve the part well. Though he is clearly young, there an agelessness to him, an ability to seem both juvenile and jaded. Partly it those windscreen-wiper eyebrows, which sit at a permanent angle and are capable of lending devious or calculating inflections to his soft face. In Detroit, where he played the ringleader of a group of racist cops torturing and murdering African Americans with impunity, it was disturbing to see so much savagery emanating from someone barely out of the playpen. His was a performance in the tradition of cinema great baby-faced monsters: Richard Attenborough in Brighton Rock, David Bennent in The Tin Drum, Cagney in everything. Small wonder he was first choice to play Pennywise the Clown in It before that project lost its original director, Cary Fukunaga. Or that in his mid-teens, he was the standout star of the Edinburgh fringe hit School of Comedy , later adapted into an series, in which child performers delivered blatantly adult material dressed as grownups. It was a kind of Bugsy Malone of sketch shows. Poulter most memorable character was a cocky white van man hollering incomprehensible remarks at passing women. By that point he had already made his film debut at the age of – as a soft-centred hard-nut in Son of Rambow , the coming-of-age comedy about a pair of schoolboys who make their own camcorder version of First Blood. “That was mad, man,” he says. “I don’t know if I would be so in love with what I do if I hadn’t had such an amazing first experience.” He was already passionate about acting, which provided an alternative to the sort of academic demands made difficult by his dyslexia and dyspraxia, as well as a reprieve from some unkindness among his peers. “I had experiences of bullying. I used drama as an antidote to some of the less enjoyable aspects of social life at school.” Garth Jennings, the writer and director of Son of Rambow, remembers Poulter as a precocious talent. “I never did more than a couple of takes for anything,” he says. “It wasn’t just that Will got it – he also understood what the rhythm of the line was, and that it would be funnier if you paused first. His instincts were ridiculously good. I spent most of my days shaking my head in disbelief, just going, ‘Yep. That was it, sunshine. That was it.’” Poulter career since then has not been without its taxing moments. Was it true, as rumour has it, that eight months playing a trapper on The Revenant nearly broke him? He gives a rueful laugh. “Um. I’m always hesitant to complain too much as an actor, but I’ll say it was physically and emotionally probably the hardest thing I’ll ever do. I just can’t imagine a tougher shoot. The conditions were so inhospitable. We were up the side of a mountain in temperatures I didn’t know existed. I find acting enough of a challenge at room temperature.” Jennings met up with Poulter when the actor was on a break from that movie. “Will was staying in the accent so he didn’t lose it when he went back. He was really locked in. Watching him in the film, you think, ‘Oh yeah, there you go – DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Will.’ He just fits right in.” Lenny Abrahamson, the director of The Little Stranger, thinks Poulter has even bigger things ahead. “He viewed in the industry as this incredibly exciting talent,” he says. “You look at him and think, ‘Is there a Bond in Will at some point? Maybe in years?’ I could see that. I could imagine him being a very dark Bond indeed.” The Little Stranger is out now.",1276,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/25/will-poulter-the-little-stranger-white-straight-middle-class-male
25,"ave I done psychotropic drugs?” Cary Fukunaga considers the question and laughs. “Yeah. Just an aesthetic amount, which is basically just enjoying yourself.” He hasn’t had the full, guided experience, he says, “where your mind is turned inside out. But I wouldn’t mind. I’m curious about it.” This curiosity is evident in the director new TV show, Maniac , which centres on pharmaceutical drug trials and takes viewers inside the minds of their human guinea pigs and off into fantastical realities. Fukunaga excels at such world building, from his gothic-tinged Jane Eyre to child soldier drama Beasts of No Nation, not to mention the debut season of the noir horror True Detective. No doubt these skills are what helped seal the deal when the producers of James Bond signed up the director after Danny Boyle dropped out at the last minute. The announcement came just days after our interview. So what clues can Maniac, as well as Fukunaga other work, give us as to what we can expect of outing? Well, there will almost certainly be some intriguing gadgets. The retro future of Maniac boasts chess-playing android koalas, tiny sanitation robots and a depressed computer. Technically, the show is a remake of the Norwegian series of the same name, which Fukunaga hasn’t seen. “Not out of any disregard,” he says. He just liked the conceit of “a show with delusions”. The original Maniac concerned a mental institution. But in early talks with Emma Stone, who stars in the new version, launching this week on Netflix, the pair decided to stay away from anything that could be seen as making fun of mental illness, instead anchoring it on drug trials that aim to eradicate unnecessary human pain. Stone plays Annie opposite Jonah Hill Owen – damaged souls who, once strapped in, become other characters in other worlds, whether they like it or not. Amid all the surrealism, Maniac is littered with moments of real trauma. The first trial sees the guinea pigs taking a pill that makes them relive the most devastating moment of their lives. It not unlike people experiences with ayahuasca , which supposedly purges users of their demons (as well as the contents of their stomachs). Fukunaga says such substances didn’t influence the show at script stage but, before shooting began, he read an article about the therapeutic use of psilocybin and LSD studies. He was fascinated. “All of these things that open up gateways in the mind – there must be something there. The mind is so complicated, we don’t understand it at all yet,” he says, citing studies exploring how the trauma of previous generations can affect us . “Say your grandmother was in the Holocaust. That gets imprinted on the DNA. The maze to understanding how we carry all these things – I think it amazing.” Maniac allowed Fukunaga to work through his own issues, too. Almost all of the concepts on screen, as well as dialogue, come from conversations he had with co-writer Patrick Somerville. “It Patrick and I wrestling with our internal demons,” he says. “We’re almost working out our own understanding of ourselves.” So their conversations about therapy for a show about therapy were genuinely therapeutic? “In terms of me being fixed now, no. But it was definitely illuminating.” Fukunaga has always looked for answers in his work, and one can’t help wondering if the Bond template can accommodate such yearning. Will he be able to avoid friction with the famously controlling producers, who have allowed directors little leeway in stamping their individuality on the franchise, as Boyle appears to have found to his cost? We shall have to wait to find out. Like Boyle, Fukunaga has been known to walk from projects, but filming begins in March next year with a release planned for February assuming all goes smoothly. Fukunaga was raised in California, the son of a Japanese-American father born in a second world war Japanese internment camp and a Swedish-American mother. They divorced when he was four, and his father went on to marry an Argentine woman, while his mother married a Mexican-American. From that point on, he straddled their worlds, moving about, spending periods in Mexico, absorbing cultures. As a teenager in Berkeley, he wished he was black instead of “the weird half-Asian kid, which didn’t seem like something to grab on to. I discovered Roots and Malcolm X. It was a golden age of hip-hop.” In Maniac, Annie and Owen become various characters in other times and places via pills that send them to alternate realities in their minds. Does that come from his own early searches for self? “It more about the different people we carry inside of us. I don’t think there was a black man inside of me,” he says with a laugh. “I was trying to find an identity, more than anything. Trying to figure out what my identity was.” Due to his eclectic roots and upbringing, he didn’t know where he belonged, and felt outside of himself. Writing stories helped, and his early films – immigration drama Sin Nombre then Jane Eyre – were “starting to scratch the surface of identity. And eventually you start looking deeper.” The first scripts of True Detective, about two cops on the trail of a serial killer in Louisiana, had already been written when Fukunaga was hired, but he brought his own aesthetic – most famously episode four six-minute tracking shot , which earned him an Emmy for outstanding directing. Not that he got caught up in the show success: by that point, he had isolated himself in a house with no internet access, writing Beasts of No Nation, which he’d been planning for years, as well as his adaptation of Stephen King psychological clown-horror novel It. Fukunaga had been hired to work on the screenplay for It in As with the later Maniac, Fukunaga and co-writer Chase Palmer put a lot of their own childhoods into the screenplay, updating the novel setting from the to the But in he jumped ship. “The writing was on the wall that it was going to be a difficult collaboration.” What did the writing say? “There were so many messages on that wall,” he says. “It was a neon sign by the end.” A non-disclosure prevents him from elaborating, but he did recently suggest that studio executives feared they couldn’t control him. Why did he think that? “You could just tell by the way they were acting.” It troubles him. “You’re still a human being, you still have feelings,” he says. “Especially if you’re a creative person. You’re sensitive. You get labelled in ways that aren’t you, and that frustrating.” More frustration followed, when he spent a year and a half adapting Caleb Carr Victorian-set serial-killer novel The Alienist for television, only to leave that after months because of budgeting and scheduling problems. The final product, he says, was very different to what he had been developing. Clearly, Fukunaga doesn’t settle for anything less than exactly what he wants. It is sometimes difficult for him to articulate what he looking for, he says, but it there – a feeling or a vision. He talks about a scene in Beasts of No Nation in which he wanted the family to come out of a church on a grassy hill, with a specific idea in his head of what that church and hill looked like. He hunted for it. “I had a motorcycle and I would go out by myself on the weekends and just look around. You’re like a bloodhound, there a whiff: ‘Just over that ridge, hopefully there that thing I have in my mind.’ And the spooky thing is, sometimes you find it. We found that church. It existed.” Cary Fukunaga can refresh James Bond with streaming-era creative mastery | Peter Bradshaw All of this brings to mind Stanley Kubrick, also famously allergic to cutting corners. It no surprise then that Fukunaga is an enormous fan. After True Detective aired, he was hired to adapt and direct Kubrick unmade Napoleon film as a Steven Spielberg-produced mini-series for HBO, under the guidance of Kubrick long-time executive producer Jan Harlan. “We want to carry the torch in a way that embodies the spirit of what he was trying to achieve,” says Fukunaga, visibly excited. In a couple of weeks he will head to the library in Kubrick St Albans home to continue work with Harlan. “I’ve been there once before,” he says. “You can become jaded, working in this industry for so long, but there are moments like, ‘Holy fuck. I’m on holy, holy ground.’” Well, quite: Kubrick is buried there in the garden. He nods. “Jan brought me to his grave and introduced me to him,” he says, awed. “That was a momentous occasion.” No need for the psychotropics.

In Bed with Madonna (aka Madonna: Truth or Dare) Part of the alchemy of a great music documentary is catching the subject at exactly the right moment, and Alek Keshishian couldn’t have trained his cameras on Madonna at a better time. In the midst of the inventive and influential Blonde Ambition tour, he finds a self-possessed genius who is a magnet for controversy, as well as for other stars: Warren Beatty announces that Madonna “doesn’t want to live off-camera”, Antonio Banderas resists her advances, Kevin Costner gets roundly insulted. But this thrilling film, split between black-and-white for off-stage and colour for on, gives the lion share of screen time to the squabbling, excitable dancers who comprise the singer extended family. This story was amended on September to correct a reference to Darby Crash, who sang with Germs not Black Flag.",1178,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/20-best-music-documentaries-ranked-rock-pop
27,"The Ladykillers What on earth was this about? A remake of the Ealing crime-caper classic (with Tom Hanks in Alec Guinness crackpot mastermind role) at least proves, if proof were needed, that the Coens have excellent cinephile taste. But this was pointless and baffling. A case of No Coen Do. Burn After Reading What a dog brunch of a film: a strained and unfunny black comic gang-show of big names, with one or two good gags and an admittedly intriguing turn from Brad Pitt as a dopey fitness freak. The Hudsucker Proxy This period Capraesque comedy about an ordinary guy – a rather uncharismatic Tim Robbins – who is elevated to corporate greatness as part of a share-price scam is an example of how the Coens’ comedy can sometimes lack focus: too quirky and spongy. O Brother, Where Art Thou? The Coens’ love of Preston Sturges resurfaced in this film that whimsically takes upon itself the title of the desperately serious social-realist movie being planned in Sturges’ Sullivan Travels. It is an appealing, likable film about three runaway chaingang convicts in depression America who pass themselves off as a bluegrass trio, their record somehow becoming a hit. Silly, amiable stuff that has faded with time. Hail, Caesar! More golden age Hollywood nostalgia with this cantering comedy about tinseltown: the boozers, the fixers, the divas, the hoofers, the scribblers. It features George Clooney as a none-too-bright ageing star in a cheesy toga-wearing Roman epic. The movie reminded the world what a great dancer Channing Tatum is. True Grit Unprecedented commercial success was what the Coens found with this handsome remake of the John Wayne classic; or rather a new adaptation of the original novel by Charles Portis. Jeff Bridges was probably the only possible casting as the no-account “Rooster” Cogburn, with Hailee Steinfeld as his employer, the Mattie Ross. It is a good-natured, well-made movie, but perhaps without the strong taste of the original, or the Coens’ other films. Intolerable Cruelty Here is the biggest “underrating” issue in contemporary Coenological studies. On release, most critics seemed to decide that this screwball divorce comedy with Catherine Zeta-Jones and George Clooney was no good. I disagree. The smoothie lawyer Miles Massey was a part Clooney was born to play, and Zeta-Jones cat-that-has-every-intention-of-getting-the-cream predator is tremendous. Raising Arizona Some Coenoisseurs regard this early comedy as one of the top three; maybe even the gold medal. For me, it doesn’t stand up that well, but it is an utterly distinctive film with twang and snap, a realist-fantasy action comedy drama with weird subplots and extraneous minor characters. Holly Hunter is the cop who falls in love with Nicolas Cage criminal; on discovering they can’t have kids, they get involved in the most wackily innocent child abduction imaginable. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs The Coens have created a gem with their latest film, a western portmanteau of tales from a comically picturesque old west, conceived with humour, warmth and visual flair. Some stories are better than others, but the best are superb, and Tim Blake Nelson has what must be the greatest role of his career as Buster Scruggs, the singin’, gunslingin’ cowpoke. Barton Fink This was the award-winning movie that turned the Coens into hall-of-famers, a fantasy satire of golden-age Hollywood about a lonely screenwriter called Fink (John Turturro) mixed up in a horrible mystery. There is a fair bit of style-over-substance, and the film was denounced by no less a figure than Arthur Miller as “meaningless”, but stylish is undoubtedly what it is. Inside Llewyn Davis The complacent world of early pre-Dylan folk is the location for this touching and often hilarious drama about a failing Greenwich Village folk singer: the prickly Llewyn Davis (that Welsh-sounding first name does not in fact exist outside this film), played by Oscar Isaac. It is a poignant look at the awful midlife decisions that artists have to make when it becomes clear that their careers are not working out. A Serious Man The big debate about how funny the Coens ever fully intend to be is maybe crystallised by the adjective in the title here: an entirely engrossing and personal film, set in the mid-west of their childhood. It is wonderfully acted by Michael Stuhlbarg (an all too rare lead role for him), who plays the academic plunged into despair when his wife declares that their marriage is over. Miller Crossing An inspired prohibition mob thriller that has been alchemised into a Coen film with an elegant and eccentric comic perspective. There is a great performance from a young Gabriel Byrne as that gangster-staple: the ambitious young guy in the organisation, a little out of his depth. And there is a glorious shootout soundtracked by Danny Boy. Fargo One of the Coen movies to be garlanded at Cannes, this comically inflected noir is now enjoying an afterlife as a TV spinoff. Frances McDormand gives what may be her greatest Coen performance as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant Minnesota cop investigating a crooked scheme by William H Macy car-dealer to kidnap his own wife. The Man Who Wasn’t There Discussions of the Coen oeuvre always centre on what over- and underrated, and there is plenty of room in the closely grouped mid-table for this kind of argument, but for me The Man Who Wasn’t There is one of their very best films: an eerily beautiful and slow-moving black-and-white LA noir in the style of James M Cain or Robert Aldrich, with Billy Bob Thornton as a barber whose wife (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her boss (James Gandolfini). Gripping. Blood Simple The Coens’ devastatingly good low-budget debut from an inspired noir thriller, quite without the comic quirkiness of their later works. It still looks and feels entirely original, despite its obvious generic inspirations. Frances McDormand is a young woman, cheating on her abusive husband (a superb Dan Hedaya), who then hires a creepy gumshoe to follow her,with a showstoppingly evil performance from M Emmet Walsh. The Big Lebowski For many, this will always be the greatest Coen film, and it is certainly beguilingly funny, baggy, freewheeling and strange, with a great performance from Jeff Bridges as the Dude, bringing a weird gravitas to a role that might have seemed merely spacey or wacky with a lesser performer. No Country For Old Men This sensational and apocalyptic drama, based on the western thriller by Cormac McCarthy, is still the Coens’ masterpiece: a noirish nightmare that takes place under a vast Texan sky, leavened with brilliant wisecracks. Javier Bardem Anton Chigurgh is a horribly bizarre villain, and Tommy Lee Jones sheriff is a voice of sanity and humour in a world of evil.",1114,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/07/the-coen-brothers-film-ranked
28,"The Miseducation of Cameron Post Director: Desiree Akhavan Desiree Akhavan is the US film-maker who got noticed with her New York-set satire Appropriate Behaviour. Now she has scored a serious success with this subversive queer coming-of-age drama starring Chloë Grace Moretz, which was a hit at this year Sundance. Moretz plays Cameron Post, a teenaged orphan in small-town America who is caught kissing the prom queen. Her aghast aunt sends her to a Christian “re-education” camp, where she has to contend with the organisers’ bizarrely misconceived ideas. Release date: September. All dates given here are for UK cinemas – other territories vary American Animals Dir: Bart Layton Is it a heist drama? A story about dysfunctional relationships? An awful warning about the elusive nature of truth? Bart Layton new film is based on the true story of a bunch of students who, in got it into their heads to steal rare books from a university library in Kentucky. The participants are played by actors but the real people themselves are interviewed, documentary-style, to put the action into context but also to question what really happened. September Crazy Rich Asians Constance Wu, star of Crazy Rich Asians: ‘I’ve lost parts for being outspoken’ Dir: Jon M Chu Based on the colossal bestseller by Kevin Kwan, this blingtastic comedy boasts an almost all-Asian cast. It is the first major Hollywood film to do so since The Joy Luck Club in and has been welcomed as a boisterous corrective to a certain kind of Hollywood racism that renders Asian people invisible. It tells the Cinderella-ish story of Rachel Chu ( Constance Wu ), a smart, hard-working economics professor who discovers her Singaporean boyfriend Nick (Henry Golding) is so mind-bendingly super-rich that it basically embarrassing. She has to impress his formidable mother, played by Michelle Yeoh. September Faces Places Dir: Agn è s Varda Agnès Varda ascends to a yet higher and more rarefied level of “legendary” status with her latest, Oscar-nominated movie, which she presents to the public at the age of It is a docu-essay that she has co-created with the French photographer and graffiti artist JR, in which they travel to various villages and small towns around France and he creates monumental photos of the people they meet and plasters them on the sides of barns and buildings. It is garrulous, engaging, revealing. September Climax Dir: Gaspar Noé The adulte terrible Gaspar Noé is back, more lethally brilliant and icily provocative than ever. Or, to put it another way, more infuriating than either fans or detractors will be entirely able to handle. Climax is based (loosely) on the true story of a dance troupe in France who held a party after a rehearsal, drank booze spiked with LSD and then succumbed to a sinister collective freakout. It is like a DJ set from hell, and some of the images Noé contrives are worryingly extreme. The dance moves are sometimes flailingly superhuman. September A Star Is Born Dir: Bradley Cooper A Star Is Born is a movie that regenerates like Doctor Who. It first appeared in then famously in as a musical with Judy Garland and James Mason, and then again in with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand. (Its story of sacrificially wounded showbiz maleness also resurfaced in more recent films such as The Artist and La La Land.) Anyway, now A Star Is Born is reborn, with Bradley Cooper directing, and playing a downwardly mobile country star who discovers a wonderfully talented singer played by Lady Gaga . October First Man Dir: Damien Chazelle Damien Chazelle , Hollywood youthful boy wonder, tackles an authentic American icon: Neil Armstrong , the first man on the moon. Ryan Gosling plays that Adam of US history, Corey Stoll is Buzz Aldrin, and Claire Foy plays Armstrong first wife, Janet Shearon . Chazelle will have his work cut out to measure up to Ron Howard superbly watchable space drama Apollo which had Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell. (Pablo Schreiber – ­Nick Sobotka from The Wire – plays Lovell for Chazelle.) October Dogman Dir: Matteo Garrone This new film returns Italian director Matteo Garrone to the world of gangsterism he portrayed in his film Gomorrah . It is a compelling opera of beta-male criminal martyrdom, inspired by a true case. Marcello Fonte won a prize at Cannes for his portrayal of Marcello, who runs a dog-grooming salon in a small Italian town and deals cocaine on the side. Then one of his loyal customers, a brutish bully called Simone with a brain addled by the white powder, forces Marcello into helping him with burglaries. Gripping, horrible and tragic. October Peterloo Dir: Mike Leigh We are approaching the anniversary of the Peterloo massacre , when British soldiers attacked an unarmed democracy rally of in St Peter Field in Manchester: an act of aggressive folly which was to be a long-term spur to parliamentary reform and radical campaigning journalism – leading, in fact, to the creation of this newspaper, originally called the Manchester Guardian. Now Mike Leigh has written and directed a drama based on these events, with Rory Kinnear as the radical orator Henry Hunt. November Wajib Dir: Annemarie Jacir Bethlehem-born film-maker Annemarie Jacir made the heartfelt and engaging drama When I Saw You, about Palestinian children in Jordanian refugee camps after the war. Now she returns with Wajib (the title translates as “Duty”), a father-son drama set in Nazareth. A young architect who lives abroad comes home to help his father with the traditional task of hand-delivering invitations to his sister wedding, and in the process has to sort out his own family issues. September King of Thieves Dir: James Marsh The bizarre true-crime story of the ageing London villains who pulled off an extraordinary heist in London Hatton Garden jewellery district in cries out for a geezer-ish Britmovie treatment. In fact, one has already been made . But now the guv’nor himself has given his imprimatur: Michael Caine stars in this new adaptation with Tom Courtenay, Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent – and Ray Winstone representing the fresh-faced younger generation. September Lucky Dir: John Carroll Lynch The late Harry Dean Stanton made one of his final performances in this plangent and thoughtful movie from actor-turned-director John Carroll Lynch. Stanton plays the eponymous Lucky, an old man meditating on the nature of mortality, fate and life itself. Stanton affecting appearance is not far from his breakthrough performance in Wim Wenders Paris, Texas . David Lynch contributes a cameo. September The Rider Dir: Chloé Zhao Chloé Zhao The Rider is a feature that straddles the worlds of documentary and fiction; a drama that uses non-professionals and draws upon their real lives. It an indie-realist slice of Americana, a tale of cowboys and bronco riders in South Dakota. A young rider called Brady is recovering after a bad accident – the sort of thing which has left a friend of his severely disabled. It is a gentle, slow-moving film which is in no hurry to reveal its truths: an immensely cherishable piece of work. September Never Here Dir: Camille Thoman Sam Shepard final performance is to be found in this enigmatic metaphysical drama-thriller from the former documentary director and UK theatre performer Camille Thoman. Mireille Enos plays conceptual artist Miranda Hall, who is in a relationship with her agent Paul (Shepard). Her latest creation is about voyeurism and surveillance, and stems from a stranger smartphone that she found (unlocked) in the street. Having used the personal information in it as the basis of an exhibition, to its owner rage, she now wonders if she is herself being tracked. September The Little Stranger Dir: Lenny Abrahamson A ghost story of the classic English sort is on offer in this movie based on the novel by Sarah Waters , whose Fingersmith was so memorably transformed into the Korean film The Handmaiden . It is set in the pinched and austere years after the war, and country doctor Faraday (Domhnall Gleeson) makes a visit to a strange, old house, where he makes the acquaintance of a young woman, Caroline (Ruth Wilson), and discovers a terrible secret. September The Captain Dir: Robert Schwentke This movie by German director Robert Schwenke, shot in stark monochrome, is based on the grisly true story of Willi Herold, a German soldier on the run from the authorities at the end of the second world war. He accidentally discovered an officer uniform and then brazened out his own situation by pretending to be an officer on precisely the same mission as those on his tail – and ended by executing hundreds of prisoners. A tough, bleak watch. September The Wife Dir. Björn Runge Glenn Close gives perhaps the best performance of her career in his hugely enjoyable black comedy. In The Wife, adapted from the novel by Meg Wolitzer, she play Joan, , the supportive wife of a world-famous author, Joe (Jonathan Pryce), whose conceited literary celebrity becomes even more insufferable when he wins the Nobel prize. Joan is a former creative-writing student of Joe who tells interviewers that she quite happy to have abandoned her own writerly aspirations and devoted herself to her husband. But that is not true. September Mandy Dir: Panos Cosmatos Here is a film to divide audiences. Some have found it mesmeric, others unbearable. Nicolas Cage stars in this sci-fi horror, futuristic in its way, although set in Cage plays a guy whose life has been destroyed by a marauding gang of sadistic satanic cultists who have killed everyone dear to him. The spectacle of Cage set on violent revenge, with his face covered in blood, is not something to be taken lightly. October Widows Dir: Steve McQueen Connoisseurs of Brit crime have a place in their hearts for Widows, Lynda LaPlante post-Sweeney TV show about the widows of a criminal gang, killed during an armed robbery, who take over their late husbands’ business. Now Steve McQueen (Hunger, Years a Slave) has directed a feature film version with Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo as the widows themselves. Hopes are very high for this. November Disobedience Dir: Sebastián Lelio Chilean film-maker Sebastián Lelio makes his English-language debut with this intensely controlled drama. Rachel Weisz plays a young woman who has to make an uneasy homecoming with the death of her father,an Orthodox rabbi, against whose strict values she was rebelling. Now she finds things very tense with her old friends, who have embraced the religious conservatism she rejected.

29,"Casino Royale Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Even a cameo from Orson Welles couldn’t lend lustre to this pointless and unfunny spoof, a dire tongue-in-cheeker that slipped past the franchise control of the producers, Eon. David Niven saunters unsexily as the retired “Sir James Bond” in this chaotic film. Die Another Day Oh lawdy. The Bond franchise was looking lost in the grim and joyless new “war on terror”-era, and this movie featured the worst gadget in the history of an invisible car. What on earth is the point of that? You can almost see the being pressed into Brosnan hand. The Living Daylights This was the turn of straight actor and RSC stalwart Timothy Dalton. He was supposedly there to give Bond a hard and gritty new seriousness, but always just looked a bit humourless. This was during the Aids era of sexual restraint, too, so Bond only cops off a couple of times. Licence to Kill Bond goes rogue, and Dalton stays dull. This one is notable for the young Benicio del Toro as a humble henchman. After this, legal copyright rows caused a six-year production hiatus during which Dalton quit. For Your Eyes Only You can hear a whistling and a crackling in the air as Roger Moore begins to tune out. The stunts hold up, but Moore is on the exit ramp and his flaccid relationship with Carole Bouquet is a deathly embarrassment. Never Say Never Again The title is what Connery agent should have shouted at him when he was offered the comeback: (“Never”! Say “Never”! Again!) Connery lumbers back for the remake of Thunderball that no one wanted or needed. He was never a six-pack guy at the best of times, but he out of condition here. One to forget. Quantum of Solace Much mocked at the time, this film wasn’t as bad as that – despite the silliest title in the series’ history. Craig is always watchable and Mathieu Amalric is a very eccentric oddball villain. The World Is Not Enough Not bad, but some of the fizz has gone. In this film, the distinction between villain and henchman seems to collapse with three bad guys: Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane and, erm, Goldie, who was very big in those days. GoldenEye Was it a Bondaissance? A Brosnanaissance? Whatever. Stylish yet assertive smoothie Pierce Brosnan had already made an impression in the TV caper Remington Steele. He took to Bond like a duck to water: virile, cool, nice suits. Judi Dench made her debut as M. Bond was back! A View to a Kill Quite unexpectedly, Moore pulled it back a bit for his last hurrah. (It was also, sadly, the last hurrah for Lois Maxwell Miss Moneypenny.) Christopher Walken was always destined to play a Bond villain and it came to pass in this film, as the evil electronics mogul Max Zorin. A good note for Moore to bow out on. Moonraker A whopping, megabudget Bond in its day, clearly influenced by the Star Wars-led sci-fi revival. It is all about the theft of a space shuttle, but this excursion into space can’t conceal the fact that Moore is looking a bit jaded. On Her Majesty Secret Service George Lazenby sole appearance wasn’t a bad Bond. Had he done more, Lazenby might have become a favourite. Diana Rigg played the woman who shows is no commitmentphobe. They marry, before gunfire poignantly restores Bond eternal singledom. Diamonds Are Forever Uh-oh. Connery was tempted back to the role with a big pay packet, now looking craggier and toupeed. Ernst Blofeld, boringly played by Charles Gray, wants to use diamonds to focus his space laser. Bond girl Tiffany Case was played by Jill St John, whose real-life boyfriend, Henry Kissinger, would have been better as the villain. Tomorrow Never Dies It took a spanking from Titanic at the box office, but this is a good, underrated Bond: one of the very few films (or plays or books) to satirise Rupert Murdoch and his Chinese expansionist plans – a rather taboo subject in media. Jonathan Pryce has great fun with the role of the villainous mogul. Octopussy Outrageously daft, but silly and fun. Roger Moore wears a gorilla costume. The Spy Who Loved Me This has a well-loved Bond song, Carly Simon Nobody Does It Better. It also introduced us to the exotic henchman Jaws. The action opens with that staggering skiing-off-a-cliff stunt, just after Moore is seen supposedly skiing in front of an obvious back projection. The Man With the Golden Gun Despite iffy reviews at the time, this has one of the very best villains, wonderfully played by Christopher Lee: Scaramanga, he of the creepy third nipple. It is a preposterous fuel-crisis drama about a solar energy device. There some funky martial arts, too. Skyfall An excellent, intelligent Bond which shrewdly expanded the role of Judi Dench M, developed her relationship with and created a plausible, sympathetic backstory for him. Javier Bardem got his teeth into the villain role. Live and Let Die And so began the reign of Roger Moore, tacitly conceding the campness that many saw as unavoidable for Bond. Moore was witty, sprightly and a mature when he took over (Connery had started at This movie has a great song from Paul McCartney and Wings. Thunderball The evil organisation Spectre had its first appearance in Fleming Thunderball novel, but we were used to it by now, this being the fourth outing for on the big screen. Good stuff here, but the franchise faltered a bit, with long underwater sequences. Spectre Boom! Craig and director Sam Mendes bring off an absolutely storming extravaganza, kicking off with a head-banging action sequence in Mexico City. Léa Seydoux has a Veronica Lake-type sultriness and Ben Whishaw almost steals the show as the geeky Q. Casino Royale Daniel Craig had to face a lot of internet bickering when he was cast, but he blew everyone away with a performance that was just right: cool, cruel, ruthless, yet sardonic. It was great at the time and looks even better now. One of the best Bonds. Dr No Sean Connery first outing in the Bond role. It gave us the gun-barrel titles and the Monty Norman theme. There was Ursula Andress in the bikini and the exotic Johnny Foreigner villain with an outrageous island lair. From Russia With Love Weirdly ungadgety and downbeat. Connery searches his hotel room for bugs for what seems like minutes, with the theme music playing deafeningly. There a great train fight with Robert Shaw Red Grant. Goldfinger “You eckshpect me to talk?” “No, Mr Bond, I expect you to DIE!” This introduced us to Bond Aston Martin and the weird spectacle of Shirley Eaton suffocating in gold. It established the convention whereby the villain leaves time to escape some elaborate automated death. You Only Live Twice This great action movie put Connery Bond right back on top and introduced us to the Nehru-suit-wearing, cat-stroking master criminal Spectre chief, Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence. Connery announced his intention to quit after this. Perhaps he knew it could never be this good again?",1186,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/24/james-bond-on-film-ranked

This year he won the award for best director at Cannes for Cold War , a drama loosely inspired by his parents’ lives during the Soviet era, in cinemas Friday. Festival Sarajevo film festival I’ve just come back from this – a wonderful festival in a haunting city, with Turkish, Austro-Hungarian and Yugoslav heritage and architecture mixed up in a unique way. When you watch films in a place where history feels so palpable and recent, they acquire a different resonance. I made a documentary ( Serbian Epics ) in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war and went there many times before and after. So the festival brought back a lot of memories. It was a very vibrant multicultural city before the war. The festival manages to recreate that spirit, if only for a couple of weeks. Film No Man Land ( dir: Danis Tanović, ) While at the festival, back at the hotel I showed my wife this Bosnian film, which won an Oscar years ago. It a powerful tragicomic tale set in the trenches of the Bosnian war. Part realist drama, part a timeless Beckettian parable, it about two soldiers from opposite sides trapped in a murderous Catch situation. The experience of the Bosnian war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia feels incredibly relevant these days in Europe, so it definitely worth thinking about. Book Dorota Masłowska “Inni ludzie” (Other People) I’m just reading this wonderful book, which is a kind of polyphonic poem in rapping verse, where characters are cartoonish and the real protagonist is language. Masłowska exploded on to the Polish literary scene at the tender age of but far from being a flash in the pan, she goes from strength to strength with each book. It a hilarious, though deeply melancholy poem about the erosion of Polish society: the cars are expensive, relations cheap, aspirations are high and motives low. Documentary Sergey Dvortsevoy Bread Day; Paradise; In the Dark Dvortsevoy films are unique – he reinvented documentary-making for me. He makes films about people trying to eke out an existence in a post-Soviet world – mainly Kazakhstan and Russia – but it the way they’re done that makes them masterpieces. He does long takes, with no cuts or directorial manipulation, conjuring up scenes where twists and punchlines emerge with God-given grace. He gets there by shooting for a long time and waiting for as long as it takes for reality to reveal its dramatic shape. Music Taco Hemingway I’d never heard of Taco Hemingway, but it turns out he a huge cult figure in Poland among young people. His agent called me because Taco wanted to use the dialogue from a scene in Cold War in one of his songs, called in Girona . So I listened to some of his work and I thought it was great – his music has a trance-like mood, but above all he really inventive with words and he does have something to say too. And via him my stepson introduced me to another rapper, a guy called Tyler, the Creator , who pretty brilliant and out there. Opera Madama Butterfly at Polish National Opera Something that really stunned me not long ago was this production, directed by [Mariusz] Treliński. It was an extraordinary piece of opera, beautifully realised and very original. I love the music of Madama Butterfly anyway, but it very difficult to give it a form that makes you enter that world, and see music as more than just music. Usually in opera I just listen to the greatest hits and let the spectacle wash over me a bit, whereas here the spectacle went hand-in-hand with the music rather brilliantly. I was bowled over. Sport The World Cup The truth is that I spent most of the summer watching the World Cup. I watched every game religiously – so this was the main cultural experience of the last two months for me. I was depressed by how badly Poland played – we overhyped the side before the tournament, while they were clearly a team of players in decline. But I loved the team spirit and the lack of narcissism in plucky Japan and Croatia. I loved how they played – how their individual skills (high especially in the case of the Croats) were put at the service of the team, and star status didn’t interfere.",778,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/pawel-pawlikowski-cannes-best-director-cultural-highlights-sergey-dvortsevoy-world-cup-poland
31,"Brubaker Released in the same year as his clunky but multiple Oscar-winning directorial debut Ordinary People , Brubaker showed a tougher side to Redford than anyone had seen before. As a prison warden who goes undercover as an inmate to clean up the penal system, he had to raise his game among some hardened character actors. “The movies I liked making dealt with an America that was a little different from the America that was propagandised,” he said. “There a grey zone that I know, and I want to tell stories about that complex part of America.” The Twilight Zone – “Nothing in the Dark” None of Redford early TV appearances were as haunting as his personification of death in this creepy-sad episode of The Twilight Zone. “You see?” he says, glowing handsomely and gesturing to an old woman dormant body as he leads her spirit into the afterlife. “No shock. No engulfment. No tearing asunder. What you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper. What you thought was the end is the beginning.” The Great Gatsby Before DiCaprio there was Redford: he may never have exuded the pure electricity of the junior actor, and his chemistry with Mia Farrow (as Daisy) was meagre, to say the least, but his permanently distracted air was just right for Jay Gatsby. In the midst of even the most vibrant shindig, he seems uniquely alone. Fame does that to you. Sneakers This underrated techno caper-comedy, about a crack team of computer security experts, was led by Redford and features River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier and Dan Aykroyd. Redford occasional returns to light comedy could be spotty – Legal Eagles should be outlawed – but he having a blast here as the slightly bumbling former radical who has become something of a sellout. Three Days of the Condor Redford most frequent collaborator was the director Sydney Pollack, with whom he made six films including the western Jeremiah Johnson and the Oscar-bait drama Out of Africa Their best, though, was this jittery conspiracy thriller in which Redford, working for a clandestine CIA group, has to be brought in from the cold after his team is massacred. Cherish the justified sense of Watergate-era dread, as well as the opening shot of Redford cycling through traffic in a goofy woolly hat and trainers. All Is Lost Redford, then had only a handful of lines as the nameless, luckless soul (billed as “Our Man”) stuck at sea and sinking fast. The concentrated intensity of this one-man show comes from its star evident vulnerability and his (literally) weatherbeaten face. The director, JC Chandor, pinpointed the poignant power: “Everything is heightened with him being older. He like a bird with a broken wing.” All the President Men The actor wanted to produce this as a small black-and-white thriller with unknowns in the leads. The studio told him: “If you’re gonna do this, then you have to be in it.” Chalk and cheese look like identical twins next to Redford and Dustin Hoffman. And therein lies the restless genius of their casting as, respectively, Bob Woodward (tall, smooth, Waspy) and Carl Bernstein (short, Jewish, fussbudget), the Washington Post reporters blowing Watergate wide open. The Candidate Redford was already chafing against his pretty-boy persona when he starred as a young Democrat hopeful in this satirical comedy. The star told the studio: “I’d like to make a film about the election process – about how we elect somebody based on cosmetics rather than substance.” The result was a film with scruples – and claws. Downhill Racer This superbly stark portrait of the American dream at its coldest, scripted by the great novelist James Salter, began Redford one-for-me, one-for-them strategy: he agreed to mainstream fare such as The Way We Were as long as the studios also backed his smaller, more daring projects. Here, he plays an emotionally arctic skier hungry to win at all costs: a brave performance to give so near the start of his film career, when most actors would want to woo the audience, not disconcert them. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Redford sole Oscar nomination for acting was, rather shockingly, for The Sting , a complacent con-man comedy. But it was his first pairing with Sting co-star Paul Newman that distils the performer essence. Although the movie is unable to fess up to its bromantic longings – did any woman in a buddy movie ever look more like a gooseberry than poor Katharine Ross? – it still worth seeing for Redford sunny charm. Even then, it seemed to trouble him faintly, as though he was worried we might take him for a himbo. The studio did. “He just another California blond,” said one executive. “Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you’ll hit six like him.” But Newman helped win him the part. Redford got a shock when he saw the first cut. “I said: ‘What the hell is that song doing in there? Raindrops? It not even raining.

32,"here a certain point during Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam (the title translates as The Man Who Saves the World, though the film is generally better known as Turkish Star Wars) when you realise that what you’re watching isn’t like other bad films. It isn’t really like anything else at all. For some, that moment will come when two Turkish space pilots crash-land on a barren planet and the one who looks like Ronnie Wood in a Thriller jacket starts doing a special whistle that no woman can resist. Or perhaps it will be when brightly coloured felt monsters slaughter terrified children in a sequence that suggests a massacre by the cast of Sesame Street. Or it may be right at the start, during an opening voiceover that is convoluted and oddly blase (“However, at some point in time, Earth shattered into pieces …”) But the real mark of distinction, and the audacious touch that has ensured the film notoriety since its release in is that the makers blithely used shots, music and sound effects from other movies. With a budget of and with many of his original spaceship sets having been destroyed in a freak storm, the director, Çetin Inanç, opted instead to simply steal footage from a print of Star Wars, which he projected behind his actors as they sat in their cockpits wearing motorcycle helmets and swaying this way and that to mimic the motion of intergalactic flight. Behind them the Death Star looms, and the Millennium Falcon whizzes past; at one point, the back-projection footage even cuts from one shot to another while the actor in the foreground remains unchanged. Star Wars rip-offs are as numerous as Ewoks, but none has been so cheekily, charmingly brazen. The film has a plot of sorts: the space pilots are pitted against the Wizard, a tyrant in spiky red headgear who needs a human brain to make a weapon that can penetrate Earth force-field. Try as he might, he can’t seem to subdue our heroes. After Cookie Monster and friends fail to do the job, the Wizard dispatches skeletons on horseback, a platoon of mummies and a giant teddy bear with tinsel hanging from its claws. When the Wizard buries the heroes alive, they simply climb out of their graves. There an all-out mummy free-for-all. Then a bar-room brawl with red yetis But none of this matters as much as the film naive tone and its unbridled chutzpah. As well as cannibalised Star Wars, there are chunks of newsreel footage thrown in and unmistakable musical thefts from Flash Gordon, Battlestar Galactica and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Coming across a copy of the movie years ago on Google Video, the film-maker and film historian Ed Glaser was agog. “I’ve never seen a film so brutally, relentlessly entertaining. It keeps chucking unbelievable new things at you. There an all-out mummy free-for-all. Then a training montage where the hero punches rocks and overcomes gravity by strapping boulders to his legs. Then a bar-room brawl with red yetis,” he says. There was every reason to suppose that the film would be consigned to video-sharing platforms and bootleg DVDs for the rest of its days. But in an advertisement appeared online offering a distribution print of The Man Who Saves the World for sale. It turned out that back in the a Turkish projectionist had held on to a copy, claiming that it had been so severely damaged it wasn’t worth returning to the studio. Now it was the only print in existence. “Countless screenings, before and after our heroic projectionist absconded with it, resulted in a lot of wear and tear, with bits and pieces getting chewed up and snipped out,” Glaser says. “So by the time I got hold of it, it was not a pristine print. The colour had faded, and I had to reconstruct parts of it from video sources.” Audiences who see the film on its forthcoming UK tour as part of Scalarama may be surprised by its fruity, overripe richness; any blips, wobbles and imperfections only add to the retro thrill. In a way, the resourcefulness, tenacity and – in the case of that projectionist – sheer gall involved in preserving and reviving Turkish Star Wars mirrors the efforts that İnanç and his cast and crew had to undertake to get the film made in the first place. Glaser even thinks the picture has an inspirational lesson to offer to film-makers everywhere. “Sometimes you have to aim above your means,” he says. “The results can be incredible.” Turkish Star Wars is on tour in the UK from September, click here for details .",774,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/14/attack-of-the-killer-jedi-the-bizarre-story-of-turkish-star-wars
33,"f you watch movies you’ll have seen umpteen deaths, sometimes in a single film. (According to the people who keep a tally of such things, the final Lord of the Rings has cinema highest body count, of more than – though presumably that includes orcs.) But what about the dying process itself? What happens to a body that is dying? A taboo-breaking new documentary filmed inside a hospice on the Isle of Wight controversially features a seven-minute scene of the final moments of Alan Hardy, a retired north London bus depot manager. Island is directed by the artist and film-maker Steven Eastwood. It started life as an installation commissioned by the Fabrica Gallery in Brighton. Eastwood spent months at the Earl Mountbatten Hospice in Newport between and working with terminally ill patients, four of whom appear in the film . What so dramatic about the footage of Alan death is how undramatic it is. I don’t know what I was expecting, a deathbed scene like the movies, perhaps: Alan mustering a few profound last words to make sense of it all, or a glimmer in his eyes as life flashes before him. Instead, for seven minutes, Alan drawn-out breaths become further spread apart until they stop. Medicated to blankness, he goes gentle into the night – thanks to the unfailing dedication of the hospice team who’ve carefully managed his death over two days. I tell Eastwood I was expecting something more. He nods. Other people have said the same thing. “What interesting is there isn’t an image. You can’t see the dying. I think that fascinating, because to talk about how the film shows you the moment of death, I don’t know when that moment is. I’ve watched it over and over. I still find myself thinking: is he going to breathe again?” As it happens, when the end came for Alan, Eastwood was asleep – you can hear him snoring gently off camera. “I’d been filming continuously for hours, so the nurses put a little mattress on the floor. I laid down minutes before he died.” How did he feel when he woke up and realised Alan was gone? “Elated, I really did. I could clearly see that his death had been very cared for, supported and painless. His death had been as a good a death as you could ask for.” The camera stays switched on as the nurses wash Alan body and comb his hair; their tenderness and respect are deeply moving. Eastwood had just started volunteering at his local hospice in east London when he saw the gallery call-out for submissions on the subject of end of life. What interested him about filming in a hospice? “I realised that there weren’t a lot of films about end of life. I just thought: how strange that there are very poor descriptions of something as natural as death, that happening on every street. In the history of visual art, there so many depictions of deathbeds. Isn’t it interesting that it fallen out of the space of art?” He mentions two contemporary artists who’ve tackled death through their work, Sophie Calle and Bill Viola, who both filmed their mothers as they lay dying. But why are there so few films that look death squarely in the face? A quick search on Google for “films about death” throws up a random list that includes Bambi (fine if you’re seven); Flatliners, the hokey thriller about medical students messing about with defibrillators; and The Death of Stalin , Armando Iannucci Soviet-era satire (which, yes, opens with Joseph Stalin carking it, but no, doesn’t have much to say about mortality, unless you’re the feared dictator of a totalitarian state). You’ll find the web longest list of films about death on the website Urns Online, which promises everything from “light comedy to stark and depressing art films”. The fact is that serious dramas involving death tend to focus more on dispelling stigma around illnesses – Aids in Philadelphia, Alzheimer in Away from Her – than the dying process. You can picture a director pitching a mortality-themed script to financiers: “I’m thinking hospital ward. I’m think nursing home. Let show them what really happens when you die. Whaddya think?” Stony silence. So perhaps there will always be a gap between fiction and reality. But documentaries do push the limits of what can be shown on screen. In Allan King filmed five terminally ill patients in a hospice in Toronto for his vérité documentary Dying at Grace. During the Aids crisis, a number of films intimately chronicled men dying from the disease (Silverlake Life: The View from Here, Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt). Controversially, the film The Bridge showed the actual suicides of people leaping to their deaths from the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco. Director Eric Steel set up a camera to film the bridge for a year, then interviewed friends and families of the jumpers. The Bridge divided critics – ghoulish snuff film or poetic meditation on suicide? Werner Herzog is a director famed for staring death in the eyes and not blinking. Yet even he refused to play the audio of a real-life death in his documentary Grizzly Man , about the naturalist and film-maker Timothy Treadwell, who was killed by the bears he was observing in the wilderness of Alaska. Perhaps the most crass and deplorable example of death on screen came years ago in the cult shock-doc Faces of Death, which claimed to feature authentic footage of real-life deaths, human and animal. It turned out around of scenes were faked – including a man being eaten by an alligator. Why do we have this taboo of showing death on screen, I ask Eastwood. “This what interests me as a maker. We carry with us a lot of folk wisdom or rules about what we think is appropriate. And I think we sometimes don’t check in with ourselves about whether that has any bearing any more.” In the weeks before shooting Island, he experienced two bereavements himself: “My partner at the time mother – the grandmother of my children – and my closest friend died within weeks of each other. I was already in that mental space. So, I was able to say to people I was talking to about the film that I’d just had a bereavement. I wouldn’t have asked for it to be that way …” His voice trails off. Virtually all the terminally ill patients Eastwood approached on the Isle of Wight were interested in meeting him to talk about the film. “They were quite happy with a camera coming into their life at that time. I think the assumption is that it wouldn’t be wanted.” Alan used to joke that he was Eastwood Charlton Heston. “I think he really enjoyed leading-man status, and the attention.” Alan, it turns out, had strong beliefs about life after death. Earlier in the film, he tells the camera that he convinced the core of him will live on. He wants to see his wife again in the next life. “I’ve got plans. I’m going to take up ballroom dancing.” Does he think immortality – the chance to live on in some way on film – motivates his subjects, I ask Eastwood. “I don’t know. I didn’t really discuss legacy with them.” It was the nurses that he struggled to get in front of the camera. Five months into shooting, he called an emergency meeting at the hospice. “I showed them a rough cut of the film, and I said: ‘It looks as though nobody is receiving care in this building.’” Why does he think they were so reticent? “I think they’re trained to be selfless.” One of the things that struck him watching the nurses was how much time they spent on the non-medical stuff. “What happens if this person estranged father turns up? Their gay partner? All these people are brought together in one room, and the nurses have to manage all of those emotions while delivering medication. Hospices are a space of life. All the drama, all of the emotions, all of the joy. Everybody had a dread of them, but I think they’re some of the most progressive spaces in our society.” Eastwood believes that hospices should be more visible in the community to remove the stigma around terminal illness and dying – to make death more familiar, less frightening. He compares our squeamishness around death to how society used to view childbirth: “Fifty years ago there weren’t many photographs or films of births, but now that understood as a celebration of our bodies.” People have come up to him after screenings, telling him the film has made them less scared about dying. “There lots of research that shows that being better informed about what happens to our bodies when we are dying can alleviate anxiety.” If Alan death feels natural, the tragedy of the film belongs to Jamie Gunnell, a lorry driver and father of two. He was diagnosed with stage-four cancer after going to his doctor with a stomach ache. “It came out of nowhere for him,” says Eastwood. “Jamie went through a lot.” In the film you watch Jamie and a couple of his mates sitting in his room at the hospice watching football with a few cans of Guinness on the go. It oddly very moving to see these blokiest of blokes joking about cancer. “Fucking hell,” says one of them watching a nurse drain the contents of Jamie stomach into a bag. “Looks like chicken stock.” Island review – unblinking vigil at death door Eastwood says that Jamie and his mates were determined to “continue their relationship on normal terms”. And business as usual meant booze and banter. “Guinness cans and football, smoking a joint out the back, that how he wanted to die.” Still, the film most haunting images are of Jamie, his face stricken by fear and confusion – totally alone, as if he is already seeing the world from the outside. “He went through period of anger and desperation, but then would bounce back, and his humour was always there. That was his way of normalising it.” Eastwood says that nurses talk about something happening when a patient is very close to death – the temperature changing in the room. Has making the film changed how he feels about death and his own mortality? He shrugs. “I take a pretty stoical view on it. I don’t feel any great fear about it. I’m very aware that I’m an animal, a biological thing. Possibly, it has made me feel reassured.” “The chances are I’ll probably die in a similar way [to Alan], if I’m lucky enough to get to late life. Most of us will die of cancer or heart disease. Or dementia. And that will almost certainly involve some kind of end-of-life palliative care support. I don’t think you can overstate how extraordinary these people are. They’re just brilliant. I loved going back to that hospice, because I loved being around those people.” Island is released in the UK on September.",1853,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/13/island-documentary-steven-eastwood
34,"t easy to make fun of the actor Mark Wahlberg , so let do it. He was asked by a fan on Instagram to detail his workout routine, but he went a lot further than that, giving a detailed breakdown of his working (out) day. If we believe the schedule he posted (and I admit there is a tiny, cynical part of me that wonders whether this is all a publicity stunt), he gets up at and spends the day in carefully timed segments in the gym, snacking, showering and, of course, praying, before going to bed at There are quite a few peculiarities in his daily routine: he has a shower at that seems to last for an hour and a half; his round of golf takes just half an hour, compared with the usual four hours – maybe he is playing crazy golf; at he has an hour of cryotherapy, subjecting himself to blasts of ridiculously cold air – three minutes is the recommended limit or you get frostbite; and he has family time at when his four kids are at school (actually, that quite sensible). It a far cry from the daily routine of Hunter S Thompson, which, as the historian Alex von Tunzelmann reminds us , involved getting up at drinking epic quantities of whiskey and coffee, snorting cocaine, dropping acid and watching pornographic movies in the hours after midnight when he was supposed to be writing . Like Thompson (and here the comparison ends), Wahlberg does not say when he finds time for rehearsing, learning lines and all that other mundane stuff, but maybe his kind of movies don’t involve much dialogue. The buff body – he looking good at – is everything. That is at the core of his insane daily routine: the battle to preserve the gloriously honed body that made him famous as a Calvin Klein model in his Sadly, he is, in the end, destined to lose that battle, which is where his Catholicism will come in useful when the muscles start to fail. Absolution before abs. Actors who were beautiful in their have two options: fight to preserve your beauty – the Wahlberg way; or embrace the disintegration – let call it the Brando method (although maybe Marlon went a little too far). Our narcissistic culture has always preferred the former for women – hence all the diet fads and plastic surgery – and now that has spread to men, too, with actors such as Wahlberg taking the lead. The grotesque thing is that impressionable young people hooked on Love Island will take it seriously. No doubt soon everyone will want a cryo recovery chamber in their back garden. Some reporters have called Wahlberg schedule “ busy ” and “ jam-packed ”. But to me it suggests someone with a short attention span who doesn’t have enough to do – even successful actors tend to have a lot of time on their hands. It also calls to mind Donald Trump, with his obsessive tweeting and golfing (although with less gym time, obviously). Trump, like Wahlberg, needs to be weaned off narcissism and given something practical to do. Basket weaving, perhaps. Both might also benefit from having a lie-in occasionally.",539,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/sep/12/mark-wahlberg-extreme-daily-schedule-mega-workout-cryotherapy
35,"Some time in the late Federico Fellini is said to have taken the beautiful young Fenella Fielding out to dinner at Claridge in London and offered her a movie that he would direct, featuring her in half a dozen roles: a sensational showcase. But Fielding turned him down, on the grounds that she was booked for a theatrical season at Chichester. It may not have happened quite that way – Fielding had a mischievous way of exaggerating anecdotes for the benefit of saucer-eyed interviewers. But however serious or merely seductive Fellini movie idea (did he expansively improvise it over brandies?), the great director was undoubtedly impressed with Fielding acting talent. She was a brilliant interpreter of Wilde and Ibsen on stage and had written and performed one-woman revue shows at the time of the Peter Cook satire boom. Perhaps Fellini was also a little in love with her. What would have happened if Fielding had somehow broken her Chichester contract and done the Fellini film? Perhaps her career and public reputation would have gone another way, and she would have achieved a position in film to match the very real respect she had earned in the theatre. As things turned out, she was destined to be remembered for just one thing, and she good-humouredly accepted that: a sexy-campy-vampy cartoon persona. This was most obviously her slinky Valeria in Carry on Screaming in which she reclines languorously on a chaise-longue, asks Harry H Corbett uptight-but-tempted police inspector: “Do you mind if I smoke?” and starts to emit vapour from her whole body. “And I was trying to give up!” says Corbett, reaching eagerly into the fog. That deathless line became the title of her autobiography. Everyone agreed that Fenella Fielding was smoking hot. Fenella Fielding, Carry On Screaming actor, dies aged Many talented actors have their careers derailed by one distinctive thing about them, which goes from meal ticket to millstone. Fielding became the victim-beneficiary of that extraordinary voice: outrageously, hilariously velvety and kittenish. In her early movie career, doing light comedies such as the Doctor movies and a farce with Norman Wisdom (whom she detested), she just sounded posh, husky and sexy. If things had been different, she could have had Joanna Lumley career. But everyone could see how well the voice played on screen. Fielding prudently declined to do any more Carry Ons after that, seeing all too clearly how she would be imprisoned. But it defined her. In her film career, she was arguably the equivalent of Kenneth Williams, who played her brother in Carry on Screaming: the absurd undead scientist Dr Orlando Watt. He, too, was a very intelligent stage performer, great raconteur and chatshow turn with a richly resonant voice that he allowed to become a self-parody; he was tempted into the cul-de-sac of popular British cinema at a time when that appeared to offer regular work and the easy hit of popular fame. But it was a Faustian bargain. As for Fielding, she continued to work in television and the theatre, including some stints with Morecambe and Wise (unlike Gerald Thomas stingy Carry On film deals, TV work with Eric and Ernie would have earned her handsome payments for their endless repeats). She became something like a national treasure, and her theatre work is a cherished memory. It would have been interesting if someone had offered her a decent film role.",566,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/12/fenella-fielding-peter-bradshaw-appreciation
36,"Inimitable, luxuriantly breathy and slyly mellifluous, Fenella Fielding, who has died aged was a household name in the when she graced and sidled across the West End stage and the television screen, as well as appearing in the Carry On and Doctor films, usually playing a vamp, or the femme fatale, alongside actors such as Kenneth Williams , Sid James, Dirk Bogarde and James Robertson Justice. There was always something exotic and possibly louche about Fielding. You never felt that she had skimped on mascara, eyeshadow or lipstick, or that her hair was necessarily all her own in its chaotic and often strangely unkempt manifestation. At the same time, she might appear in public, and occasionally on television, on a chat show, or the popular word game Call My Bluff, dressed in clothes of a distinctly severe line, with white collars back and front, clasped with big jewellery, which gave her the appearance of an unlikely modern nun on the run. No one ever had such a laughing drawl, or haughtier, naughtier intonations. And then she would be spied scuttling around the stacks in the London Library, researching and reading, writing up her diary; as an intellectual, she was no slouch. She was as clever as she was funny, the emphatic articulation a sign of both the musical value she attached to words and the precise weight and emphasis of their meaning. A lot of gurgling and swooping went on, but years at the coal face of cabaret and intimate revue ensured that Fielding timing was never out, her meaning never insecure, her indecision always final. Her defining performance was that of Lady Parvula de Panzoust, an outrageous, high-fashion maneater, in Sandy Wilson Valmouth a brilliant musical version of Ronald Firbank orchidaceous novelette. When the piece was revived by the director John Dexter at the Chichester festival theatre in Fielding returned to the role, as did her fellow original cast members, Bertice Reading and Doris Hare , to theirs. By then, Fielding stage career was virtually over. Her utterly distinctive performance persona was both her chief calling card and her greatest handicap. The world of entertainment treasured a talent it found increasingly hard to accommodate. In she opened the restored Lyric Hammersmith studio space with a solo show (with piano trio) that included poems by WH Auden , Fran Landesman and AP Herbert, as well as Broadway songs and an erotic sketch during which you heard her orgasmic moanings offstage before she marched on smartly to shoot the lover boy dead. With her flounced auburn locks arrayed in startling bunches on either side of her face, and dressed in a chic rust trouser suit, she resembled a whacked-out Theda Bara with just enough juice to last the evening. She was gloriously funny and uncompromising. Later in her career, certainly as Madame Arcati, the eccentric medium, in Noël Coward Blithe Spirit at the Salisbury Playhouse in her magnificent weirdness was scuppered by a weakened technical assurance; nor could you imagine such a creature pedalling herself home for seven miles on a bicycle. Fielding Arcati would only have contemplated a sedan chair fitted out with an abundance of cushions and custards, borne by two well-built local lads with a penchant for show tunes. Fenella grew up in a mansion flat in Clapton, east London, with her parents, Philip and Tilly Feldman (both Jewish, he an immigrant Lithuanian, she originally Romanian), an elder brother, Basil (later Lord Feldman, a Tory peer), and a “sort of nanny person” who took Fenella to dance classes on the Holloway Road. Philip was a cinema manager and boss of a ladies underwear factory, a prominent freemason and, according to his daughter, abusively violent towards her. The family moved to Edgware in when Fenella was and a pupil at the North London collegiate school. She won a scholarship to Rada, but left after one year, pressured by her parents to “get a proper job”. She took a secretarial course while studying at Saint Martin School of Art (now Central Saint Martins ) and worked for the actors’ agent Al Parker, and in a beautician parlour. But she was determined to go on the stage. After a grounding in concert halls and club theatres around London, she left home, took a flat in Clarges Street, Mayfair, which she shared with a prostitute, and started making cameo appearances on the night club scene of the at Churchill in Bond Street, the Don Juan in Brook Street and in the Washington Mayfair hotel. She was talent-spotted while appearing at the London School of Economics in a revue written by Ron Moody , and this led to her first West End professional engagement, in a revue, Cockles and Champagne, at the Saville. So she was a comparatively late starter, but she made up for lost time as an exotic vamp, Luba Tradjejka, in Jubilee Girl at the Victoria Palace. She was acquiring a following, and the producer Michael Codron cast her first in Valmouth and then in a revue, Pieces of Eight at the Apollo co-starring Williams – with whom she soon fell out, noting that he wanted her to be good, but not too good – which featured sketches written by Peter Cook and Harold Pinter . Her earliest films included Doctor in Distress with Bogarde at his smoothest and sprightliest as Simon Sparrow, and Ken Hughes Drop Dead Darling in which, as a wealthy object of Tony Curtis attentions, she was treated to a ride out in the country, where she jumped over a hedge Curtis had artfully placed on the edge of a cliff. Fielding played Valeria the vampire in Carry on Screaming a very funny spoof of the Hammer horror films, in which she curled up on a sofa and exhaled the line, “Do you mind if I smoke?” after which vapour billowed out from beneath her body; the phrase served as the title of her chatty autobiography, written with Simon McKay. She could be perfect in Feydeau farces, and was just that in Sardou Let Get a Divorce at the Mermaid in and as the aptly named Lady Eager in another Mermaid classic, Lock Up Your Daughters an updated musical version by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall , with music by Laurie Johnson , of both Henry Fielding Rape Upon Rape and Vanbrugh The Relapse, with Christopher Plummer as Lord Foppington leading a cast including Georgia Brown, Glynis Johns and Roy Kinnear. The Chichester festival theatre was another regular haunt; she was Mrs Sullen in The Beaux’ Stratagem there in and an imperious duchess in Look After Lulu, adapted by Coward from Feydeau, in Even Ibsen held no fear for her, and there were glowing reports of her Hedda Gabler in Leicester in and her Nora in A Doll House at the Gardner Centre in Brighton in She moved in into a top-floor flat in Connaught Mews, near Marble Arch, which cost her just a week. She had a knack for landing on her feet in her personal life that perhaps evaded her professionally later on. She did not marry, but said that for years she kept two lovers on the go, one of them married, without either knowing of the other existence, as befits a Feydeau specialist. In her memoir she described the men who had behaved badly in the workplace: Tony Hancock was “drunk”, Warren Mitchell simply “horrible” and Norman Wisdom (with whom she filmed Follow a Star in prone to on-set lechery: “His hand up your skirt first thing in the morning was not a lovely way to start a day filming,” she said. Critics loved her and hated most of the things she was in. When she played Kaa the rock snake in The Jungle Book at the Adelphi in she wrapped herself around a pole in a manner that reminded Michael Billington of Hermione Gingold in a Medea parody clinging to a phallic pillar with a cry of “This is my personal column!”, while another scribe said of her Lady Fidget in a vile production of The Country Wife at the Mermaid in that she “pouts like a tulip in a field of potatoes”. Fielding continued working past her birthday, making radio programmes, recording poetry and voiceovers and rarely going anywhere without her spider-like eyelashes, eyelashes Dusty Springfield once acknowledged as the model for her own. She was not immune to the appeal of drink, drugs and psychotherapy, but survived all these brushes to come out fighting, and as huskily cheerful and optimistic as ever. She was appointed OBE in the Queen birthday honours in June. She is survived by her brother.

37,"The former Carry On actor, Fenella Fielding , has died aged her spokeswoman has said. The star, who enjoyed a showbusiness career spanning seven decades, suffered a stroke two weeks ago and died on Tuesday. She appeared in two Carry On films – Carry On Regardless in and Carry On Screaming! in – and was awarded an OBE in the Queen birthday honours list. Carry on Screaming Fenella Fielding on fighting with Kenneth Williams and bouncing back after bankruptcy “We are very sad to announce that Fenella Fielding OBE passed away this afternoon on Tuesday September,” her spokeswoman said. “This follows a severe stroke two weeks ago. During that time, she has been very comfortable and always looked tranquil and divine. And always wearing her eyelashes. “Miss Fielding was an incredible talent. That voice! A unique woman, much loved by family, friends and fans. She will be missed tremendously.” According to Fielding website, her career began in when she starred on stage in The Constant Lover. Her television roles included parts in The Avengers, The Prisoner and The Morecambe and Wise Show. She also boasted stage credits in plays by Shakespeare and Henry James. But it is her role alongside Kenneth Williams as Valeria in Carry On Screaming! for which she is best known. The popular film parodied Hammer Horror movies and her memoir Do You Mind If I Smoke? is named after one of its best-known jokes. Fenella Fielding – a life in pictures She recounted falling out with Williams while they worked on the comedy revue Pieces of Eight together after a newspaper article praised her. “Kenneth came out of the wings and he had the paper in his hand and he had the most terrible temper about it. I thought, God, I can’t help the fact they’ve said something nice about me.” While she had success, she felt typecast. Speaking to the Guardian last year about the public perception of her, she said: “There are always people who don’t think you should be able to climb out of your cave.” She said that she felt she was not offered more serious roles because “you’ve got to show you’re not just a lark”. While her performance as Hedda Gabler was lauded, she felt that not enough people saw it. “Then you’ve got to get people to let you do one after another after another, before it obliterates the comedy you’ve done,” she added. In her book, she accused the comic actor, Norman Wisdom, of “always making a pass – hand up your skirt first thing in the morning”. Looking back on that period last December, in the light of the #MeToo movement , she said: “There was a time when every man I met … it was really something horrid” Fielding was born in London to a Lithuanian father and a Romanian mother.

38,"he boy in the photo smiles through broken teeth. Over the years, his palate was smashed so badly that he required an emergency blood transfusion. His cheek was so scarred that kids at school called him Frankenstein. He suffered countless head injuries. The explanations logged in the hospital notes say Jason King was a clumsy child and way too curious about blunt objects. The case file from social workers flags a more desperate tale. But because Jason family stayed on the move – so much so that within one period he went to six different schools – it was difficult for authorities to keep track of the little blond boy. Imagine your childhood blanked out by amnesia. That the reality for Jason, now and the star of a new documentary, Ghosthunter , which lives up to its name on multiple levels. When independent filmmaker Ben Lawrence first contacted him, Jason was a security guard in Sydney western suburbs. He burly, but with a slight lisp from the smashed palate. And there the pure, childlike joy he takes in his side job: being a paranormal investigator. Rediscovering The Crow director Alex Proyas dazzling 'lost' debut film Despite living on the breadline, Jason doesn’t charge for his ghostbusting service; saving the day is feel-good enough. He’d had the idea when he kept seeing the ghost of his older brother Peter, a taxi driver who died in a collision. Jason checked out some ghost tours, then settled on a kind of ghost hunting outreach service that makes home visits. He put decals on his car, made up T-shirts for his small crew and tooled up with cameras and meters. Lawrence initial contact with the genial ghost hunter revealed an interesting potential angle. Peter, who was adopted out of the family, had tracked Jason down when the latter turned and become the one positive role model in Jason life. “I thought I would be telling a story about grief,” Lawrence tells Guardian Australia. The loss of Peter was unfathomable. Jason memories of his father were shadowy. His sister had been removed from the family, and his relationship with his mother was poor – her sole contribution to the film is to write Lawrence a letter. “Go get fucked,” the director reads out loud, in a grimly humorous scene. But the stakes were raised when Jason showed Lawrence his horrific medical records. Surely the more interesting film, Lawrence surmised, would be to piece together Jason childhood by finding his father. Jason readily agreed; Lawrence was the first person to whom he’d felt comfortable opening up. Usually he’d tell people he’d had a bad life and leave it at that. “A few times I rang up and tried to get help; agencies and a few doctors, psychiatrists,” Jason says. “They’d just go, well you need I don’t have that kind of money. I was also worried about people judging and I just thought that I was in the too-hard basket.” Concerned about how to proceed, Lawrence sought advice from the Blue Knot Foundation, which supports adults affected by childhood trauma. “The mechanism of traumatic amnesia is one of dissociation,” says president Dr Cathy Kezelman AM. “A lot of people don’t remember big parts of things that have happened to them. Jason has fragments but he doesn’t have much coherence or a chronology.” In Ghosthunter, Jason wanders through the dilapidated housing estates he grew up in, gazing at the walls for answers. On one stairwell, some kids have scrawled their names for posterity. One of those children is Cathy Quinlan. She texted Jason halfway through filming, asking if he remembered her. He didn’t. She sent him photos of gaggles of kids in backyards, with Jason beaming among them. When they established a rapport, she revealed her real reason for contacting him – that, like him, she was looking for his father. Jack King had sexually abused her, and the others. Now Jason bore an extra burden: the sins of the father. If Ghosthunter had been commissioned by a production company – with the deadlines that entails – it would never have unfolded in the fortuitous way it did, over seven years. “While I don’t believe in ghosts,” Lawrence says, “I feel there was something we were agitating in the universe, that these people were going through similar phases in their lives. They collided at the point that I happened to be telling Jason story.” When Jack King is tracked down and prosecuted, Jason turns up to court with Quinlan – who he comes to regard as a sister – and the other victims. “I wanted to show them that I was there for them, not for him,” he says now. But it starts to seem increasingly odd that Jason could keep his positive persona throughout these incredible stresses. He hammered from all sides with bad fortune, captured in claustrophobic scenes set around Sydney west. One relationship after another disintegrates. A fire rips through the house he lives in, and he forced to sleep in his car. Twice, he is unreachable and it emerges he attempted suicide. Finally, his sister Linda calls Lawrence and lays it to him straight – Jason is not the man he seems. And then the story catapults to another level. Without unveiling it here, this pivotal moment spoke acutely to Lawrence, who had previously worked on theTV series Man Up , about male suicide. It also marked the point that he had to visibly step into the film and intervene. The ensuing scenes, he says, polarise audiences. As for Jason father, he was sentenced to years in prison, with seven years’ non-parole. While inside, he writes a response to Jason plea for answers, which is brutal in its flip-flopping. “We questioned even giving his father a voice,” says Lawrence, “but I feel like it was a breakthrough for Jason. Self-awareness is something that, when I first met Jason, was not very considered. By the end of the film there a softening in him. He went through so much in the time we spent together. When we completed the edit I let it sit with him for a few days, but he didn’t shy away from anything.” Ghosthunter will have a limited national release, but its legacy will live on through the Blue Knot Foundation, which is using the film to educate students, social workers, police and those working in the criminal justice system about neglect and traumatic memory. Jimmy Barnes epitomised Australian masculinity. Now he redefining it | Greta Parry For Jason, there a sense of resolution and of emerging from the ashes. “I know I’ve changed a lot,” he says. “I just want people to see that I’m not that person that I used to be.” By the end of the film he has a new girlfriend, Julia. “I told her all about the film when we met online and she didn’t believe me,” he says. “The day we met she pulled me aside and said, ‘I know you’re not doing this movie,’ and then we went to Penrith Panthers for dinner and she rocked up and saw the camera crew sitting there.” Lawrence has since been best man at the couple wedding. The theme was Halloween. Ghosthunter has a limited national release on September This article was amended on September to correct the description of Man Up, a TV show about male suicide, which was incorrectly described as a domestic violence campaign.",1241,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/11/who-even-am-i-a-ghost-hunter-investigates-his-own-haunted-childhood

40,"man stands on the stage. The sun is setting on his career but he is – for now – still in the spotlight. He suddenly reaches out into the shadows and plucks a woman from the crowd. She takes the spotlight from him, and he self-destructs into oblivion. Hollywood is built on remakes and reinventions, but the most interesting and certainly the longest-running of these first emerged more than a decade before the first Superman movie. A Star Is Born , which gets its fourth outing next week after months of ecstatic hype, is now years old and has starred, in its various incarnations, increasingly improbable pairings: Janet Gaynor and Fredric March in the original; Judy Garland and James Mason in the remake; Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in the version; and now Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Often described as a Pygmalion story, A Star Is Born is more like Cinderella, with the leading man playing not just the fairy godmother who gives the woman a makeover, but the prince who marries her and finally the wicked stepmother who needs to be destroyed so the woman can live happily ever after. One of the most striking things about the Star Is Born films is how faithful the versions have been to what came before them. The storyline has remained steadfastly unchanged and certain scenes and even some lines reverberate between each one (the already heavily memed exchange between Cooper and Gaga from the new trailer, in which he tells her to turn around “so I can take another look at you”, is straight out of both the and versions). The gender politics of the films has remained almost defiantly untouched by feminism second, third and fourth waves, as they all suggest that the woman success emasculates, even feminises, the man. In the version he makes dinner so it is ready for when she comes home from work, to her embarrassment; in the and films she puts makeup on him as her career starts to eclipse his. In all of them, a happy ending of sorts is achieved when, at the end, she introduces herself to her fans by her married name. You don’t come to A Star Is Born for subtlety. The remakes all follow a template, too: the female lead is played by a singer-performer who has a lot to prove to the public, while the leading male role is dumped on some poor schmuck forced to accept that he will be very much the second fiddle here. The Star Is Born quasi-franchise is wheeled out almost every years, meaning we can chart shifting attitudes towards fame over the course of what is now almost a century. (For some reason, the series skipped the unless you count The Bodyguard as the Star Is Born from that decade, which I very much do.) Each remake says more than it realises about its stars, and more than it means to about its stars’ feelings about their fans. Look how we suffer for you, our ungrateful public, each film says, and the public continues to love the movies for it. Meanwhile, the behind-the-scenes stories from the movies are invariably more illuminating than the onscreen one. So whether the movies are wonderful terrible or shameless awards bait they are each extraordinarily revealing about the times in which they were made, and the people who made them. The most interesting thing about the film is how much it was rooted in actual biography. Multiple famous men from that era have been cited as the inspiration for the alcoholic and ultimately suicidal leading man, including Barbara Stanwyck husband, Frank Fay, and Colleen Moore husband, John McCormick, as well as several silent movie stars whose careers tanked when talkies arrived. A Star Is Born , in its original form, is a sly indictment of the toll Hollywood takes on men, and for extra measure it lobs some pointed jokes at Hollywood women. While Gaynor character is presented as a blameless ingenue, the movie takes potshots at some of the biggest – and most independent – female stars around in that era, including Mae West and Katharine Hepburn (I’ve always suspected that some of these shots came from the acerbic pistol of Dorothy Parker, who co-wrote the script). This movie is the dark sister of Singin’ in the Rain, a far more rose-tinted version of what became of actors back then in Hollywood when time and technology overtook them and women became the more powerful celebrities. It is an anxious gasp about male irrelevancy and female ascendancy. Which brings us to the remakes, which should be titled A Star Is Reborn, as in each one the female lead was already a huge star but, for wildly different reasons, needed a new kind of acceptance from the public. Judy Garland version is indebted to the original – the leading characters even have the same names – but this is very much Garland movie, on every possible level. It was her first film in four years, and her desperation for it to be a success echoes her character desire for a big break. She plays Esther Blodgett, an aspiring singer, who is spotted by a Hollywood star and notorious drunk, Norman Maine (beautifully acted by James Mason), who launches her career and then, after marrying her, nearly destroys it. This epic three-hour movie is rightly considered a masterpiece, but the layers of irony within it make it almost unwatchably poignant: various studio executives tell Esther what is wrong with her face, just as they did to Garland as a child, cursing her with a lifetime of insecurities; Esther practises saying the name given to her by the studio, Vicki Lester, just as Garland – born Frances Ethel Gumm – must have once had to do. Most obviously of all, Esther frequently pleads with her husband to stop abusing his poor body, just as those around Garland pleaded with her. In probably the most famous scene , she tearfully asks: “What is it – what is it that makes someone want to destroy themselves?” while her already raddled face – which looks at least a decade older than her years – is a testament to how Garland was destroying herself while making the film. Over the course of the shoot her behaviour became more erratic and her lateness drove the film already unthinkable budget of ever upwards. Garland life was divided between the two characters in the movie: the young hopeful from the past, whom she was playing, and the used-up, broken-down addict from the present, at whom she had to stare while acting opposite. Her fans in the film go from cheering her every song at the beginning to ripping the veil off her face at a funeral to see her at her worst; it not hard to guess from this movie how Garland felt about the public. She was also all too aware of the parallels between herself and the characters, and this worsened her mental state. The director George Cukor wrote to Hepburn during the shoot: “About three weeks ago, strange, sinister and sad things began happening to Judy. [She is like] someone unhinged.” It probably did not help that Garland then husband, Sidney Luft, bought all the furniture from the movie at the end of the shoot and put it in their house, meaning Garland ended up living inside her own movie, with all its sense of predestined doom. According to Lorna Luft , Garland and Luft daughter, A Star Is Born “cost my mother, emotionally, a great deal. It cost my parents – it affected their marriage. It was sort of art imitating life imitating art.” The presence of Sidney Luft makes this film an especially strange double game. Luft was an odd Hollywood figure, a former boxer who married Garland, and he is listed as producer of the movie. Their relationship is a gender reversal of the one in the movie: she gave him his Hollywood break, and he then had to look after her. He didn’t look after her enough: they divorced and Garland died at only of an accidental overdose. If the version of A Star Is Born is about Hollywood tragic underbelly, then the version is about its ludicrously narcissistic top coat. Just as Garland then husband pitched the movie as her comeback and was made producer, so Streisand then boyfriend conceived this movie as her relaunch, and installed himself in the producer seat. But whereas Luft was a relatively normal person, Streisand boyfriend, Jon Peters, is an extraordinary character. He met Streisand when he was hired as her hairdresser on another movie and not only became her boyfriend but used his relationship with her to make this movie and then go on to become one of the most powerful and divisive men in Hollywood. If any star was ever born out of the Star Is Born franchise, that star is Peters; he even listed as the producer of the version, proving that not only are stars born, some of them never go away. Peters wanted the public to see Streisand as sexy and hip and this movie, he believed, was the solution. They decided to set it in the music industry, and after Neil Diamond and – mindbogglingly – Elvis Presley fell through as the male lead, Kris Kristofferson, Streisand ex, was cast in the thankless role of the pickled rocker. This could have been a fantastic film, one that reflected the sexual revolution among the rock’n’roll generation, topped off with Streisand all-conquering voice. Unfortunately, if predictably, Peters’ and Streisand supersized egos got in the way and jettisoned that. They were so difficult that the movie director, Frank Pierson, wrote an article about them before the film even came out, in which he described Streisand constant complaints that there weren’t enough closeups of her, and Peters’ hopeless ineptitude as a producer. Streisand was too narcissistic to include all the frailties that made Garland character so unforgettable and instead she became the least credible ingenue ever committed to screen. Far from being amazed when she is lifted from obscurity to superstardom, her character acts like it is completely her due. She also dresses like someone from an older, stuffier era (“Nobody told her that people now wear jeans sometimes,” Roger Ebert wrote in his review .) The public barely features in the film; when Streisand looks out of car windows, what she sees is her own reflection. As inadvertent psychological studies go, it a doozy – a souvenir from a time when Hollywood could throw away money on movies that were made less for the audience and more for the stars. Bradley Cooper, who directs and stars in the latest film, had the good sense to not make the mistake of his predecessors and so didn’t involve his partner in the film. Instead, in Lady Gaga , he found someone willing to be as vulnerable as Garland but with Streisand screen-hogging presence, making her character transition to global superstar feel credible. To be taken seriously in a movie today, a woman must be made under, not over, and so whereas Streisand was sexed up, Gaga – as the pre-publicity hype refuses to let us forget – goes without her usual makeup and hair product, and looks genuinely terrific. Oscars who are this year early frontrunners? But this film takes far more from Streisand film than Garland. Most obviously, it is set in the music industry, thereby allowing the movie to critique fame without attacking the movie business. Like Streisand before him, Cooper seems to have found that when you make a movie starring yourself the temptation will always be to put your idealised self on the screen. And that is the biggest problem with this otherwise extremely fun movie: both characters, Jack and Ally, are improbably selfless, loving people. The one flaw between them is Jack addictions, but these, Ally reassures him, are not his fault but “a disease”. Even Jack half-hearted jealousy of Ally career is treated as an expression of his alcoholism, as opposed to a natural human emotion. The movie would be a lot more interesting if Cooper had gone for even half of James Mason complexity. But at least Cooper gives his character more backstory than Kristofferson got. He gets at least as much as screen time as Gaga, and it hard not to smile at Cooper gall – at this point in time – for emphasising that one of the most famous stories about female success is really about faded masculinity, but there no doubting that someone becoming unfamous is a more interesting story than someone becoming famous. The movie would be more accurately titled A Star Dies. A Star Is Born review – Lady Gaga mesmerises in Streisand shoes It is also fascinating for what it says about modern fame. The public is either an anonymous crowd or predatory individuals demanding selfies, which is probably how celebrities now see them. By coincidence, or maybe not, Garland, Streisand and Gaga are all gay icons whose gay fans played an enormous part in their success, but only the movie acknowledges this, or even that gay people exist in the entertainment business at all. What comes across in this movie is how strongly the public now think it is their right to be famous, and how much famous people sneer at this belief. A running joke is Ally father (Andrew Dice Clay) repeatedly insisting he is better than Frank Sinatra. Everyone has talent, but only some people have something to say, Jack solemnly tells Ally. And yet the whole message of A Star Is Born is that anyone can be famous, if they just happen to meet a celebrity in a bar. The fantasy of the film depends on maintaining that illusion, but the longevity of A Star Is Born relies on us believing celebrities are special – stars. In the age of reality TV and social media, that weird duality has never felt more relevant. A star is born and another must die – and then another will rise again.",2354,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/28/female-success-and-male-decline-what-a-star-is-born-tells-us-about-fame-fear-and-feminism
41,"Two highlights of Danny Boyle celebrated London Olympics opening ceremony were undoubtedly the Queen parachuting in with James Bond and the surprise cameo by Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean, as “first synthesizer” in the London Symphony Orchestra rendition of Chariots of Fire. Little did we realise at the time what a torch-passing moment this was. Six years on, look at where we are. The Bond brand is in crisis. Daniel Craig was only just persuaded to return (with a skipful of cash) but Danny Boyle has walked from directing the latest instalment, and some are wondering whether the franchise shouldn’t just call it a day. Meanwhile, with exquisite timing, along comes a third outing for Atkinson own spoof spy in Johnny English Strikes Again. The question is: which one better represents modern Britain? Most Brits would prefer to think of themselves as Bond: dashing, sophisticated, cool in a crisis, seducing all before them and subduing their foes. But to the rest of the world, they are far closer to English: inept, bumbling, xenophobic, and likely to make any situation worse. In Johnny English Strikes Again, Atkinson launches missiles at French cyclists, burns down a French restaurant, and stumbles around blindly assaulting innocent Londoners (in a virtual reality test gone wrong), while Emma Thompson tells him: “The country is in a state of complete chaos.” Even if you are trying your hardest not to read any of this in the context of Brexit (there, I said it), the rest of the world will not be so generous. Between English and his other Anglo caricature, Mr Bean, Atkinson is as big a brand as Bond globally. Mr Bean is so huge in China that Atkinson reprised the character last year for a local movie the rest of the world never saw. The animated series is broadcast in countries. Bean is part of the culture. Via an interactive mobile game, he the face of tourist promotions for post-Brexit London and he the figure every vaguely weak politician is compared to: Ed Miliband, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, even Theresa May (“the Mrs Bean of British politics” - the Sun). Atkinson himself waded into political waters last month, defending Boris Johnson joke about burqa-wearers resembling letterboxes as “pretty good” (to be fair, he was more interested in free speech than fanning Islamophobia – we hope). According to Atkinson, who now Mr Bean has officially retired. Strikes Again will likely be the comic last turn as Johnny English, too. But while the press is perennially speculating which actor should be the next Bond, perhaps the more important question is: who should be the next Johnny English? Daniel Craig ? Idris Elba? Michael Gove? Let the bidding commence… Johnny English Strikes Again is in cinemas from October",459,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/24/johnny-english-v-bond-whos-cinemas-best-hero-for-brexit-britain
42,"More than women have made allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the number continues to grow each day. Among the Hollywood mogul accusers are household names who were still looking to establish themselves when the alleged offences took place. Below are some of the allegations made public so far. What Harvey Weinstein tells us about the liberal world | Thomas Frank The Italian actor Asia Argento alleges that Weinstein raped her when she was She told the New Yorker she had been invited to what she thought was a party in his Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc room near Cannes, but found herself alone with him. He changed into a bathrobe and asked her to give him a massage. She said she had reluctantly agreed, but that he pulled her skirt up and forcibly performed oral sex on her. She said she felt guilty about what she described as a “horrible trauma” and for not fighting him off. She later went on to have consensual sexual relations with him, which she described to the magazine as one-sided and onanistic, because she believed he would ruin her career if she didn’t comply. “After the rape, he won,” she said. The British actor Lysette Anthony says she was raped by Weinstein in her London home in the late Anthony, who currently appears in the Channel soap Hollyoaks, has given an interview to the Sunday Times describing an attack that left her feeling “disgusted and embarrassed”. She first met the producer in after being cast in the film Krull. It was a number of years later, Anthony alleges, that Weinstein rang her doorbell. “He pushed me inside and rammed me up against the coat rack in my tiny hall and started fumbling at my gown. He was trying to kiss me and shove inside me. It was disgusting.” Unable to push him away, she continues. “Finally I gave up. At least I was able to stop him kissing me.” Anthony has reported the rape allegation to the police who are investigating. Lucia Evans , then Stoller, was an aspiring actor when Weinstein approached her at the Cipriani Upstairs club in New York in she told the New Yorker. He arranged a meeting at the Miramax office, where she found herself alone with him. “He forced me to perform oral sex on him,” she said. “He a big guy, he overpowered me.” She told the magazine she blamed herself for not fighting harder and that she was still haunted by it. Gwyneth Paltrow was and had been hired for the lead in the Jane Austen adaptation Emma. She told the New York Times she had been summoned to Weinstein hotel suite, where he suggested she give him a massage. She said she refused and felt petrified. She confided in her then boyfriend Brad Pitt, who confronted Weinstein. Soon after, the producer warned her not to tell anyone else. “I was expected to keep the secret,” she told the newspaper. “I thought he was going to fire me.” During the release of Playing by Heart in the late Angelina Jolie found herself in a hotel room with Weinstein, she told the NYT. He made unwanted advances which she rejected. “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth and as a result chose never to work with him again, and warn others when they did,” she told the paper. Women, we should stop gaslighting ourselves and trust our instincts | Mona Chalabi Another anonymous actor claimed Weinstein had raped her. He changed into a bathrobe and “forced himself on me sexually”, the New Yorker reported. She felt “horror, disbelief and shame” and considered going to the police, but then thought about how much she could lose and decided “just to move forward”. She continued to have a professional relationship with him after the alleged rape. Mira Sorvino , who starred in several of Weinstein films, found herself in his hotel room at the Toronto international film festival in “He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,” the Mighty Aphrodite star told the New Yorker. She said she had managed to leave. Rosanna Arquette , who starred in Pulp Fiction, told the New Yorker she had been supposed to meet Weinstein for dinner at a Beverly Hills hotel to pick up a script, but on arrival was told to go to his suite. He answered the door wearing a white bathrobe and saying he needed a massage. She said he grabbed her hand and pulled it towards his penis which was “visible and erect … My heart was really racing. I was in a fight-or-flight mode”. She said she told him: “I will never do that”, and that he responded by telling her she was making a huge mistake. She claims her career later suffered. Ambra Battilana Gutierrez , a Filipina-Italian model, was when she was invited to Weinstein office in the Tribeca neighbourhood of New York. He lunged at her, groping her breasts and attempting to put a hand up her skirt while she protested. She went straight to the police. The New Yorker published an audio tape recorded when she was equipped with a NYPD wire tap. In the recording, Weinstein begs her to join him in his hotel room. She refuses and asks him why he had groped her breast the day before. “Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in. I’m used to that. Come on. Please,” he says. “You are used to that?” Gutierrez asks. “Yes,” Weinstein replies, later adding: “I won’t do it again”. He also says: “Don’t ruin your friendship with me for five minutes.” Moguls and starlets: years of Hollywood corrosive, systemic sexism Zoe Brock , a model and writer from New Zealand, then accepted an invitation to Weinstein hotel suite at Cannes believing others would be present. When others left she found herself “alone in a remote hotel suite with Harvey fucking Weinstein,” she blogged. She alleges he took his clothes off and asked for a massage, forcing her to run to the bathroom to escape. “Harvey chased me, dick, balls and all, and banged on the door with his fists, pleading with me to come out”. She agreed to come out once he was fully dressed and then left. Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film Swingers, told the NYT she was when Weinstein invited her to a screening which turned out to be a solo trip with him to a cinema. Afterwards, he asked if they go to his apartment to pick something up, where he went to the bathroom, came back in a robe and asked her to massage him. She said he told her “everybody does it”, but she refused. He left the room and returned nude. “He literally chased me. He wouldn’t let me pass him to get to the door,” she told the paper. Then he implored her to at least show him her breasts, but she refused. Tomi-Ann Roberts was a college junior working as a waitress when Weinstein set up an audition at his hotel. When she arrived, he was nude in the bath, she alleged in the NYT. He told her she would have a much better audition if she was comfortable “getting naked in front of him” as she might have to play a topless scene. She left, apologising, telling him she was too prudish to go along with it. The Secret Actress: I've lost count of the unwanted hands that have touched me Ashley Judd , a US actor who has starred in a string of box-office hits, was when Weinstein invited her to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for what she thought was a breakfast meeting. Instead, he had her sent up to his room where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower, she told the NYT. She said her thoughts were: “How do I get out of this room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein.” Emma de Caunes , a French actor, met Weinstein at a Cannes party in She told The New Yorker he had invited her to a lunch meeting at the Ritz in Paris. In the hotel room he disappeared into the bathroom, leaving the door open. “I was like, what the fuck, is he taking a shower?” she said. He came out naked with an erection and demanded she lie on the bed, she said. He told her that many other women had done so before her, but she left and slammed the door. R omola Garai , a British actor who starred in Atonement and the BBC series The Hour, was when Weinstein auditioned her wearing only a bathrobe at the Savoy hotel, leaving her feeling “violated”. She told the Guardian she “just tried to make out it was normal because as far as I was concerned it was a job interview. I knew something had happened to me that I didn’t like and that I felt belittled by it. But I didn’t feel like I had the right to complain”. Dawn Dunning was attending design school and waitressing in New York when she met Weinstein. The aspiring actor was invited to a meal with him at a Manhattan hotel, but on arrival was told to go to his suite because he was running late at a meeting. She told the NYT she found him alone in a bathrobe behind a coffee table covered in papers he said were contracts for his next three films. She alleged he told her she could only sign them on the condition she had three-way sex with him. She laughed and he grew angry, she said, telling her: “You’ll never make it in this business. This is how the business works.” She fled, left acting and became a costume designer. The actor Rose McGowan reportedly reached a settlement with Weinstein following a hotel room encounter during the Sundance film festival. She had recently had a memorable role in the slasher movie Scream which came out in Lauren Sivan , a former Fox News host, has alleged Weinstein trapped her in a closed restaurant and masturbated in front of her in after attempting to kiss her. Liza Campbell , a writer and artist, told the Sunday Times Weinstein had summoned her to his hotel room in London before telling her to get in the bath with him, which she refused to do. The French actor Léa Seydoux , who was awarded the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival for Blue is the Warmest Colour, told the Guardian that Weinstein lunged at her and tried to kiss her on the lips in after a Paris fashion show they were both attending. “I had to defend myself. He big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him,” she said. The British actor Claire Forlani posted an account of her experience on Twitter, recalling two meetings at a hotel where “I ducked, dived and ultimately got out of there without getting slobbered over, well just a bit. Yes, massage was suggested.” Weinstein also spoke about all the actresses he had slept with and what he had done for them, Forlani said. The Canadian actor Erika Rosenbaum alleged that Weinstein masturbated behind her while holding her neck. In an interview with CBC she said the producer made aggressive sexual advances during three separate meetings around years ago. The masturbation incident took place in a hotel room during the Toronto film festival, she said. “He grabs me by – he holds me by the back of the neck and faces me to the mirror and very quietly tells me that he just wants to look at me and he starts to masturbate standing behind me.” She continued: “He really took something from me.” The screenwriter and actor Louisette Geiss told a press conference that Weinstein masturbated in front of her while she was making a pitch. She was in his office, adjacent to his hotel room, during the Sundance film festival in Weinstein excused himself to go the bathroom. He returned in an open robe before getting in the bath. “When I finished my pitch I was obviously nervous, and he just kept asking me to watch him masturbate. I told him I was leaving. He quickly got out of the tub and grabbed my forearm as I was trying to grab my purse and led me to his bathroom, pleading that I just watch him masturbate. My heart was racing and I was very scared.” The British actor Cara Delevingne alleged she was sexually harassed by Weinstein early in her career, detailing how he encouraged her to kiss another woman in his hotel room. After she refused and tried to leave, Delevingne said: “He stood in front of [the door] and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room.” Sophie Dix , an English actor who was on the brink of a career in the British film industry in the told the Guardian her trajectory was “massively cut down” after an alleged attack by Weinstein in a London hotel. Dix, who was at the time, described the alleged assault as “the single most damaging thing that happened in my life”. Eva Green , who starred in the James Bond film Casino Royale, has said she felt “shocked and disgusted” by a meeting with Weinstein, where she “had to push him off”. The French actor responded to comments made by her mother about the Hollywood mogul. She told the Telegraph: “I met him for a business meeting in Paris at which he behaved inappropriately and I had to push him off. I got away without it going further, but the experience left me shocked and disgusted.” British singer and model Myleene Klass told the Sun that when she was the Hollywood producer offered her a “sex contract” at a film festival lunch at Cannes in while working for CNN. The American actor Heather Graham wrote in Variety that Weinstein implied she had to have sex with him in order to get a movie role. She said he had offered her the chance of choosing a script. “Later in the conversation, he mentioned that he had an agreement with his wife. He could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town. I walked out of the meeting feeling uneasy.” She was never hired for one of Weinstein films. Lupita Nyong’o , the Oscar-winning star of Years A Slave, published a personal essay about her alleged harassment in the New York Times . She detailed several encounters with Weinstein in which the producer allegedly offered to help her career in exchange for sex. Nyong’o said she first encountered Weinstein while she was a student attending the Berlin film festival. Shortly afterwards, she was invited to a screening at his home in Westport, Connecticut, where Weinstein asked if he could give her a massage. When she tried to sidestep the request by offering to give him one instead, Nyong’o said Weinstein told her “he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that.” At a later dinner in New York, Nyong’o said Weinstein propositioned her again and continued to pursue her afterwards. The Game of Thrones star Lena Headey said Weinstein spoke to her inappropriately at the Venice film festival and reacted angrily when she resisted his advances in a Los Angeles hotel. In a series of posts on Twitter , Headey said she “felt completely powerless” and Weinstein walked her to the hotel exit “by grabbing and holding tightly to the back of my arm”. The US actor Angie Everhart alleged that Weinstein masturbated in front of her on a boat during the Venice film festival. “I had just arrived and I was sleeping, I was in my bed,” she said. “I wake up and Harvey is standing above my bed ... all of the sudden he takes his pants down and starts doing his stuff.” An Italian actor and model , whose name has not been released, told the Los Angeles Police Department she was raped by Weinstein in a hotel near Beverly Hills in “The LAPD robbery and homicide division has interviewed a potential sexual assault victim involving Harvey Weinstein, which allegedly occurred in an LAPD spokesman said. Dave Ring, the woman lawyer, said his client thanked the “courageous women” who had previously spoken out. #MeToo named the victims. Now, let list the perpetrators | Jessica Valenti The Vietnamese actor Vu Thu Phuong said in a Facebook post that she agreed to meet Weinstein at a hotel room in to discuss a role. When she arrived, she said, he greeted her in a towel and offered to show her how to perform sex scenes. Jessica Barth , the actor known for her roles in the film Ted, told The New Yorker that in Weinstein asked her to give him a massage while he was naked, an incident that reportedly inspired Seth MacFarlane to make a joke about it at the Oscars after Barth told him about it. The former actor Heather Kerr alleged in a press conference that Weinstein exposed himself to her and forced her to touch him during a private meeting in She said he wanted to have sex with her and offered to take her to parties where he would tell her who she needed to sleep with. “I was frozen with fear, trying to remain calm, trying not to freak out because, after all, there was nobody else in the office,” Kerr said. She left and stopped acting soon afterwards: “He told me that this was how things worked in Hollywood.” Weinstein allegedly invited a Kate Beckinsale to his hotel room, where he greeted her wearing only a robe, she told the Hollywood Reporter . “A few years later, he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realised he couldn’t remember if he had assaulted me or not.” Alice Evans , a British actor, said in a Telegraph article that Weinstein invited her to join him in a bathroom at the Cannes film festival. “Just go. I’m right behind you. I want to touch your tits. Kiss you a little,” he allegedly said. As a young, powerless woman trapped alone with a predator, I did not run | Van Badham Another British actor and model, Amber Anderson , said she was years old when Weinstein coerced her into a private meeting in where he propositioned her with a “personal” relationship. “He told me not to tell anyone I was alone with him, told me if I did it might affect my opportunities,” she wrote on Instagram . “He tried to take my hand and put it in his lap, which is when I managed to leave the room.” Judith Godrèche , the French actor and writer, told the New York Times that Weinstein invited her to his hotel suite in at the Cannes film festival to discuss business, but then asked her for a massage, which he said was an American custom. “The next thing I know, he pressing against me and pulling off my sweater.” Godrèche said she pulled away and left the suite. Daryl Hannah claimed she repeatedly turned down Weinstein advances during promotional work for Kill Bill and its sequel. He tried to get into her hotel room several times, the Splash actor said, and once got a key and “burst in like a raging bull”. She alleged he asked to grope her breasts and then asked her to expose herself to him, she told The New Yorker . Sopranos star Annabella Sciorra has accused Weinstein of rape and sexual harassment in She told the New Yorker Ronan Farrow the assault happened after she had filmed The Night We Never Met, which Weinstein produced. Having dropped her off after a group dinner, she alleged, he forced himself into her New York apartment. “I struggled but I had very little strength left in me.” she said. “And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, why did I open that door? ... I felt disgusting.” The Norwegian actor and model Natassia Malthe accused Weinstein of raping her in a London hotel room after the Bafta awards ceremony in She told a press conference in New York he went to her room and when she opened the door he barged in and forced himself on her. “It was not consensual. He did not use a condom.” She was “completely grossed out” and lay still “like a dead person”, she claimed. Mimi Haleyi , a former production assistant for a TV show made by the Weinstein Company, accused the producer of rape by forcibly performing oral sex on her without her consent in She told a New York press conference she had met him several times to try to maintain a good business relationship, but when she visited him at his house, he forced himself on her. “I told him no, no, no, but he insisted,” she claimed, saying Weinstein pinned her to a bed and removed a tampon. “I was mortified. I was in disbelief and disgusted.” The actor and model Dominique Huett filed a civil suit with Los Angeles superior court alleging the Weinstein Company “aided and abetted” Weinstein in “repeated acts of sexual misconduct”. According to documents uploaded by Variety , the lawsuit alleges Weinstein asked Huett to his Beverly Hills hotel room in under the pretence of discussing her career. Once there he asked if she would give him a massage, before suggesting he perform oral sex on her. Huett said she refused, but claims Weinstein “would not take no for an answer”. After performing oral sex on Huett, Weinstein masturbated in front of her, the suit claims. Brit Marling , the actor and co-creator of the Netflix drama OA, has accused Weinstein of luring her to his hotel room and suggesting they take a shower together. In an essay for the Atlantic she said she managed to get out of the room after realising “it was clear that there was only one direction he wanted this encounter to go in, and that was sex or some version of an erotic exchange”. Salma Hayek wrote in the New York Times that she repeatedly refused Weinstein alleged sexual advances, and that he once told her: “I will kill you, don’t think I can’t.” Angelina Jolie alleged she was propositioned by Weinstein in a hotel room during the release of Playing by Heart in In an email to the New York Times , she said: “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.” Florence Darel , a French actor, claimed Weinstein promised to help make her big in the US if she became his “part-time mistress” . Darel claimed: “He talked to me about a film he wanted to make about world war one and he began to tell me that he found me very attractive and wanted to have an affair with me,” she told French media . When she told him she had a partner whom she loved, she claims Weinstein told her he only wanted her to be his mistress for a few days a year. “Basically he said that if I wanted to make it in America, it would be through him,” she alleged. “I told him I had to go, and left.” Canadian actor Lauren Holly claimed in an interview with Canadian TV that the producer had showered and used the toilet in front of her after inviting her to his hotel room in the late She alleged he then approached her naked and requested a massage, at which point she “pushed him and ran”. Zelda Perkins , the British former assistant of Harvey Weinstein, claimed she was paid to keep quiet after accusing him of sexual harassment. She told the Financial Times she signed a non-disclosure agreement in after making the accusation. She claimed he asked her to give him massages and that he tried to pull her into bed. Weinstein has denied many of these allegations. His spokeswoman has said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.” Though he was unable to respond to anonymous allegations, of those made on the record “Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual”, the statement said. Weinstein has been charged with rape, a criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct for alleged incidents involving two separate women, after he surrendered to authorities in New York on Friday May.",4197,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/the-allegations-against-harvey-weinstein-what-we-know-so-far
43,"News reaches us this week, from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them director David Yates, that the next film in the Harry Potter spin-off will not “explicitly” mention the gayness of Hogwarts honcho Albus Dumbledore. This is an exciting development for keen followers of the wizard constantly evolving sexuality. The first step in the fictional magician journey came in when, after writing a series of seven books that never mentioned Dumbledore fancying anyone at all, JK Rowling delighted an audience of Potterheads by “revealing” that he was gay. Quite how somebody is supposed to be gay without it ever being said, written or observed is for greater minds than mine to fathom, but this apparently throwaway comment duly entered Potter lore. Time-travel ahead years, and David Yates finds himself making Fantastic Beasts the entire point of which is that it about Gellert Grindelwald, whom Rowling had said (but not written) that Dumbledore was in love with. So the film-makers of this Potter-adjacent franchise that nobody had foreseen are in a spot of bother, since for obvious reasons it would be politically and financially savvy if the new films could also somehow get away with him being gay while never stating it, like the seven books and eight films we’ve already had. That the thing with coming out, or being an ally: you might actually have to run the risk of taking some sort of personal hit, or having to stand up for yourself. This refrain isn’t new, and JK Rowling is not the sole proprietor of a series that wants to be seen to be doing the right thing while saving its own hide. In October of last year, Tessa Thompson tweeted that the bisexuality of Valkyrie would not be “explicitly addressed” in Thor: Ragnarok , but that she had tried to “stay faithful to that in [her] depiction”. The consensus is that it makes no difference whatsoever in the way Valkyrie kicks ass or utters dialogue. But, once again: if a character is not described as black, or gay, or deaf, or very old, the reader or viewer cannot be asked to accept that they are such. The whole point of being in a minority is that your characteristics describe you; your whole identity is marked out by difference, or opposition. Why Dumbledore must not be the token gay person in Fantastic Beasts It easy to be flip about this trend if you aren’t invested in the films concerned. The mooted but never beheld sexuality of Dumbledore, like the Loch Ness monster, is personally hilarious to me – but I don’t belong to a generation that grew up on Potter books. For many young people, the subject of seeing themselves represented in some manner in the universe they love is of deeply felt importance, as can be seen in the many replies to JK Rowling responsibility-shirking tweets on the matter. Studios are beginning to cotton on, albeit with painful slowness, to the idea that alternative sexualities and genders are here to stay, and that their young audiences now have evolved views on representation in movies. The new Star Wars films are doing well with racial representation, fielding increasingly diverse casts, but the one romantic pairing absolutely everybody wants to see from the movies – namely, a hot interstellar make-out sesh between Finn and Poe – has still not materialised. Still, the Star Trek films have got in on the act – however tentatively – and Beauty and the Beast, which made at the box office last year, featured a homosexual moment that the Guardian Peter Bradshaw described as “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it”. Meanwhile, Deadpool is purportedly pansexual and Ezra Miller is the first openly queer lead actor in a superhero franchise (although he revealed last year that studio execs told him he had made a mistake in coming out). Perhaps future Potter-related films will course-correct, and Dumbledore will finally be allowed to blossom into the homosexual man he has apparently been all along. Perhaps these early skirmishes about sexuality and representation will come to seem berserk to future generations, who will be baffled that Rowling characters, being magical creations in an alternative universe, needed to be gendered at all or have a circumscribed sexual bent in the first place. For now, we anxiously await a new development in Dumbledore storied sexuality saga.",721,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/01/fantastic-beasts-2-why-cant-they-just-let-dumbledore-be-gay
44,"hen Larry Clark released his excellent film Bully in I wrote that just as Cézanne said Monet ""was just an eye, but my God what an eye"", so Clark was just a pervy old voyeur, but my god what a pervy old voyeur. Well, even this beady-eyed gift seems to be deserting him now. His connoisseurship, visual sense and expertise in transgressive eroticism are dwindling. The photographer and film-maker who made his sensational debut with Kids, nearly years ago, returns yet again to the activity of gloating over young people bodies, with huge amounts of explicit sex. But the party looks to be well and truly over. In fact, it looks as if it has gone straight to the hungover-and-can't-face-clearing-up stage before any fun has been had by anyone. This film is joyless, passionless, humourless, incurious about real people real lives. There is no energy or verve, just the compulsive persistence of the porn addict. Its setting is Paris, and Clark is conceivably aiming at a nouvelle vague feel (though it could be as well be in any mall anywhere in the US) where a bunch of skater boys hang out, and a few girls are perfecting their skills and occasionally baiting a grumpy old tramp called Rockstar, played in cameo by Clark himself. In one gruesome scene, Rockstar gets to suck one of the boys' toes, shouting: ""Fuck my nose with your toe!"" Is he paying for the privilege, or is the boy in question giving him a freebie? Nearby an American guy played by Michael Pitt (a cast-member from Bully) strums his guitar, a kind of a choric figure, but with no choric observations to offer. They are young, lithe, pert — no ugly skateboarders here, and they are really into porn. One of the things that has changed in the world of young people since Clark started making his films is that YouTube and smartphones have allowed them to make and star in their own dirty movies, and Clark voyeurism prerogative has in some ways been conceded to the youngsters themselves. Most improbably, a couple have softcore sex in public, surrounded by other affectless skater kids, one of whom is recording it on his iPhone. Porn sites link to ads for escorts and the boys start earning real money from ageing men and also ageing women whose awful, wrecked, liver-spotted nudity is on display. The skaters' world is a very selfish, facile, one, and indeed one skater is denounced in these terms by his mother. But the denunciation has no real sting or meaning because Clark is still insisting that their selfishness is sexy. Narrative closure is forced on the situation when a girl who hangs out with the guys feels irritated and excluded by their world. It leads her to an act of spite that in turns leads to a death: and this finale is as empty and contrived as everything else. One of the boys is reading Gérard De Nerval, another has a picture of Rimbaud on the wall. But these touches lead nowhere: it another pose, another piece of set dressing. The world of skaters has been represented with sympathy and real interest by the American documentary film-maker Stacy Peralta, and Gus Van Sant Paranoid Park dramatised the haunted, vulnerable, side of their lives. But of course here it isn't about the skating, it about the bodies: whatever the actual skating skills of the actors on screen, Clark makes them look like male models pretending to skate. However fervent he is, and I admit there is a kind of fervency here, his young people are subject to enormous condescension. We play out to a cover version of Bob Dylan Forever Young, and it appropriate enough: the director gets older and the kids stay the same age, although we are entitled to wonder if they aren't a bit more grownup than him. Clark earlier work, particularly that pointed and disturbing drama Bully had great power, and his abilities were quite plain. But judging from The Smell Of Us it a talent and a worldview which have become stagnant. The title is unbearably ironic.",688,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/31/larry-clark-the-smell-of-us-peter-bradshaw
45,"veryone, look this way. Everyone. Hellooo…!” The Observer photographer is having difficulty getting the Skate Kitchen crew to concentrate. Casual in front of the dramatic backdrop of a soaring Brooklyn Bridge, the young women straggle and chat, drag their skateboards, scroll on their phones, discuss what they’re going to do after this. “I’m gonna skate across the bridge,” says Nina Moran, “It too hot!” says Ardelia “Dede” Lovelace, “It my birthday today,” says Rachelle Vinberg (she turning “I forgot until my mom called me. What am I doing to celebrate? I want to go for a run.” “Oh, it always like herding cats,” says Crystal Moselle. Moselle is the director of the Sundance-breakout Skate Kitchen , a coming-of-age film about an all-female New York skateboarding collective so closely based on the lives of the girls it features that it seems more like documentary than fiction. The lines are very blurred. Moselle was drawn to the group initially because of how they looked. She spotted Moran and Vinberg on the subway and approached them because of Moran noisy charisma and because it was so unusual to see young women with skateboards. “I took them for coffee,” she says. “Which they were really excited about, because they’d never been to coffee with an adult before.” Moselle first feature, The Wolfpack , which won the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance festival in was a documentary about an extraordinary New York family of boys, the Angulo brothers, kept away from society by their father. In that case, too, Moselle just happened upon them: she saw the brothers walking on the street, and chased after them because they looked so unusual (they were dressed like the characters from Reservoir Dogs ). The Wolfpack , as the title implies, was about the family group. Similarly, Skate Kitchen is about a crew: the friendship group of young women that Moselle met through Moran and Vinberg. “There something about the ensemble that I really love,” says Moselle. “How an individual works within that.” Moselle hung out with the girls for a year: Vinberg, Moran, Lovelace and their friends Kabrina Adams and Jules Lorenzo (plus Lorenzo sister, Brenn, and Ajani Russell, who aren’t here). They all spent a lot of time at Moselle house in Brooklyn – “it was a safe zone” – and she listened to their conversations, interviewed them and eventually got them to rehearse scenes. For each scene, she didn’t tell them what to say, but gave them what she calls “beats” – significant moments – that they had to get to. Most of the incidents were based on real life. In the film, Camille, played by Vinberg, is banned from skateboarding by her mum after she severely injures herself. She “credit cards” herself, which is exactly as leg-crossing as you imagine. (“She hurt her vagina,” deadpans Moran. “Yeah, I’ve done that twice in real life,” says Vinberg.) Lonely and bored in her Long Island home, Camille connects with a Lower East Side female skateboarding crew via Instagram. She quickly accepted and, after her mum and her argue irrevocably, moves in with Janay (Lovelace) and her family. Though she is welcomed by the crew, Camille isn’t always at ease. Early in the film, the girls are walking in the street and Kabrina Adams is playing music from a speaker that hangs around her neck (she has it on today). As Junior Senior Move Your Feet blasts out, she and Moran start dancing around. Vinberg holds back: she more inhibited, not a dancer. This happened in real life, and was the cue for Moselle to develop Camille story: “She was timid and that was when I thought: ‘This is the dynamic we need in the movie,’” says Moselle. Camille is an outsider who accepted, and can’t believe her luck. But then she messes up. She becomes friendly with a boy skater, Devon – played by actor/rapper/songwriter Jaden Smith, one of the film few experienced actors – and everything goes wrong. “Camille doesn’t really know the rules of friendship,” says Moselle. “She never really had friends before and this group of women is everything she ever wanted, but she doesn’t understand the codes. So she thinks [about Devon]: ‘We’re just skating, we’re just friends, it isn’t anything’ – but it is something. She breaks rules without meaning to.” Skate Kitchen strength is its intimacy. You are right inside its world, whether the women are talking about tampons and toxic shock syndrome, or they’re stoned and messed up at a party, or skating en masse around Manhattan streets. And that world is very true to life. “I’m obsessed with the idea of realism with film,” says Moselle. “I want to make films that feel real in every aspect. Even if it a period piece.” Originally, she wanted to do a documentary about the skate crew, but rejected that idea, partly because she was asked to make a short film for Miu Miu Women Tales series ( That One Day – it features Vinberg, Moran and Lovelace and is akin to a Skate Kitchen precursor), but also because “with documentary, you have to stand back and observe. You can’t alter what going on. With this, I wanted to immerse myself, be a part of it.” Still, though the film is close to real life, there are differences. Despite the main plot point, all the girls are cool with the male skateboarders who feature in the film – “they’re our friends,” they say – and they already knew Smith, a fellow skateboarder, and whom they suggested for the part. (Moselle got him to move to New York and hang out with everyone for a few months.) But that not to deny that girls in skateboarding often get a tough time from their male counterparts, who vastly outnumber them in New York, as elsewhere. Moran has given a TEDx talk about the difficulties this can lead to. How when she started skateboarding, at she was ridiculed by the boys she hoped to skate with. How when she worked in a skateboarding shop, she discovered she was being paid less than her male colleagues (she quit). How a boy she considered a friend told her that girls can never be good at skateboarding. Lorenzo, who started doing tricks only a year ago, who only started doing tricks a year ago, says a lot of guys try to get involved: “They’re like: ‘Oh, do you need help with that?’ And I’m like: ‘Thanks, but I didn’t ask you!’ They just come over because you’re a girl. I already know how to do it, I’m just practising.” Moran: “It like when they say: ‘Oh, I didn’t realise you actually skated!’ I’m like: ‘Bro, really? You thought I carried the board like an accessory? Like it my purse?’” “It micro-aggressions,” says Adams, “Everyone does it and we don’t even think about it, it just ingrained in society. Like when a guy talks to you when you’re clearly listening to music.” They all agree that it far easier to learn as a female skateboarder if you have other women to skate with. Though they come from different parts of the US, with varied family backgrounds, they all started skateboarding aged about and spent hours on their own, just practising. “Did you ever do that thing where you wouldn’t drink water until you landed a trick?” says Vinberg. “I used to sleep in the skate park sometimes,” says Moran. “It was OK until it rained.” Skate Kitchen review – spiky youth culture drama keeps you on board Skateboarding is a strange combination of efficient means-to-get-around and show-off tricks. It attracts outsiders, say the women, artistic types, into clothes and self-expression, sometimes with anger issues (Adams says she gave up doing tricks because when she was young because she used to get so mad: “I threw my board too many times.”). They all prefer the street-cruising aspect, “the freedom”. Some of the most warming scenes in the film show this: the group skating together, taking up space in a city in a way that most young women don’t. “Strength in numbers,” says Moran. “We’re more powerful as a group.” The film has brought the Skate Kitchen -ers to an international audience: they’ve travelled as far as Taipei, where Vinberg spent an afternoon skating around with a stranger, communicating simply by means of her skateboard (she let him share it). Their increased visibility has prompted other women to get in touch, wanting to learn “just simple stuff like what board to get, how to set it up”. Moran organises all-female skate meet-ups through Instagram, announcing a skate park, date and time: any woman that turns up wanting to have a gotry is welcomed. Some members of the group hope to do more acting, if they can fit it in with all their other projects. Lovelace paints, Adams dances and makes her own short films, Vinberg would like to direct. Moran likes acting too. “But really,” she says, “I just want to make an army of skateboarding women. Yeah. That’d be lit!” Skate Kitchen is out on Friday",1518,/film/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/23/skate-kitchen-girls-on-wheels-on-film-crystal-moselle

London air pollution is poisoning my son, says campaigner “I have been amazed as the picture has emerged showing us just exactly what the impact of air pollution is on children in the UK,” said Alastair Harper from Unicef UK. “Research is coming out all the time showing us how these toxic emissions can lead to lasting and devastating health impacts, impacts that will last their entire lives, from stunted lung growth to asthma to brain developments . It is horrific.” Unicef intervention follows a series of new studies which highlight the impact of the UK air pollution crisis on children health and will increase the pressure on government to intervene. The charity, which is now working with schools across the country, as well as clean air groups, is calling on the government to introduce a fully funded national action plan to protect children from the effects of toxic air. Harper said: “We want a national strategy specifically to protect children from harm, and a ring-fenced pot of funding to focus on the ways to reduce children exposure to toxic air. “We now know that exposure is most acute when they are travelling to and from school or nurseries and even inside the classrooms. Now there is no excuse not to take immediate and determined action.” He said measures should include vehicle exclusion zones around schools, a network of clean air zones, improved walking and cycling infrastructure in towns and cities and more child friendly urban areas. Last year a Guardian investigation revealed hundreds of thousands of children are being exposed to illegal levels of damaging air pollution from diesel vehicles at more than schools and nurseries across England and Wales. Earlier this month it emerged that children were absorbing a disproportionate amount of air dangerous pollution on their way to and from school – and while in the classroom. One school was found to have several times over the World Health Organization pollution limit for the most damaging particulates inside several of its classrooms. There is a growing campaign among some parents and schools to ban the school run and encourage walking and cycling, but Unicef said central government needs to step in to orchestrate a nationwide policy that protects young people health. “It has taken a while to understand the true nature of the problem but now we do know and we have to act.” Harper said that unlike some other problems facing young people – including entrenched poverty and obesity – air pollution was relatively simple to address, if there was the political will. “The fact is that it is so needless, we can fix this – other things are more intractable – but this is something we can resolve.” The government has been widely criticised for its lack of action on air pollution. It has lost three court cases and is one of five nations that have been referred to Europe highest court for failing to tackle illegal levels of toxic air. Harper said: “All children have the right to breathe clean air, and toxic air not only violates children right to breathe clean air it also impacts on their future and that is unacceptable.”",612,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/uks-children-denied-basic-human-right-to-clean-air-says-unicef
1,"The National Trust and other conservation groups have urged ministers to rule out burying nuclear waste below national parks as fears grow that the Lake District is being eyed as a potential site. In January, the government restarted its attempt to find a community willing to host such a facility after a previous search collapsed five years ago. Ministers have refused to exclude national parks from the process. The green groups argued putting a nuclear dump under a national park would threaten the spent by millions of visitors. “We recognise that safe disposal of nuclear waste is one of the key challenges our society currently faces but this should not be used as an excuse to put at risk the huge range of benefits these areas deliver for society, the environment and the economy,” the groups said in an open letter to the nuclear energy minister, Richard Harrington. The Lake District national park is seen as a potential location for the underground facility, given Cumbria nuclear history and proximity to Sellafield, where most of the UK nuclear waste is currently stored. The groups, which include the Woodland Trust and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said Harrington risked undermining “long-established protections” afforded to national parks by comparing the prospect of a deep nuclear waste facility to a potash mine in North Yorkshire. Harrington cited the mine as an example of development within national parks, telling MPs this summer that the potash mine would “leave very little blot on the landscape”. Asked if he would exclude national parks as possible locations for a geological disposal facility for nuclear waste, Harrington said: “I am not saying we should have them on national parks but it would be very wrong to exclude them at the moment in this big policy statement.” Ministers have subsequently argued that “we cannot afford to restrict the siting process” and “most of the facility will be underground”, in letters to campaigners that have been seen by the Guardian. MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee concluded that national parks should not be excluded . Roy Payne, the executive director of GDF Watch, which is monitoring the siting process, said even if parks were not ruled out, the chance of the facility being built beneath one was “close to zero”, given local communities had the final say. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: “Legislation already ensures developments in national parks can only proceed in exceptional circumstances and must be appropriate and proportionate.” Walking the Brexit tightrope at Labour conference – Politics Weekly Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen",460,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/nuclear-waste-national-parks-lake-district-conservation-groups
2,"At least half of the world killer whale populations are doomed to extinction due to toxic and persistent pollution of the oceans, according to a major new study. Although the poisonous chemicals, PCBs, have been banned for decades, they are still leaking into the seas. They become concentrated up the food chain; as a result, killer whales, the top predators, are the most contaminated animals on the planet. Worse, their fat-rich milk passes on very high doses to their newborn calves. PCB concentrations found in killer whales can be times safe levels and severely damage reproductive organs, cause cancer and damage the immune system. The new research analysed the prospects for killer whale populations over the next century and found those offshore from industrialised nations could vanish as soon as years. Among those most at risk are the UK last pod , where a recent death revealed one of the highest PCB levels ever recorded. Others off Gibraltar, Japan and Brazil and in the north-east Pacific are also in great danger. Killer whales are one of the most widespread mammals on earth but have already been lost in the North Sea, around Spain and many other places. “It is like a killer whale apocalypse,” said Paul Jepson at the Zoological Society of London, part of the international research team behind the new study. “Even in a pristine condition they are very slow to reproduce.” Healthy killer whales take years to reach peak sexual maturity and months to gestate a calf. PCBs were used around the world since the in electrical components, plastics and paints but their toxicity has been known for years. They were banned by nations in the and but of the tonnes produced have yet to be destroyed and are still leaking into the seas from landfills and other sources. The international Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants came into force in to tackle the issue, but Jepson said the clean-up is way behind schedule. “I think the Stockholm Convention is failing,” he said. “The only area where I am optimistic is the US. They alone produced of all PCBs, but they have been getting PCB levels down consistently for decades. All we have done in Europe is ban them and then hope they go away.” The researchers said PCBs are just one pollutant found in killer whales, with “a long list of additional known and as yet unmeasured contaminants present”. Further problems for killer whales include the loss of key prey species such as tuna and sharks to overfishing and also growing underwater noise pollution. The new research, published in the journal Science , examined PCB contamination in killer whales, the largest analysis yet. The scientists then took existing data on how PCBs affect calf survival and immune systems in whales and used this to model how populations will fare in the future. “Populations of Japan, Brazil, Northeast Pacific, Strait of Gibraltar, and the United Kingdom are all tending toward complete collapse,” they concluded. Lucy Babey, deputy director at conservation group Orca , said: “Our abysmal failures to control chemical pollution ending up in our oceans has caused a killer whale catastrophe on an epic scale. It is essential that requirements to dispose safely of PCBs under the Stockholm Convention are made legally binding at the next meeting in May to help stop this scandal.” Scientists have previously found “extraordinary” levels of toxic pollution even in the Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean. Mariana trench live feed: engrossing viewing from deepest place on Earth “This new study is a global red alert on the state of our oceans,” said Jennifer Lonsdale, chair of the Wildlife and Countryside Link whales group. “If the UK government wants its [proposed] Environment Act to be world-leading, it must set ambitious targets on PCB disposal and protect against further chemical pollution of our waters.” The research shows that killer whale populations in the high north, off Norway, Iceland, Canada and the Faroes, are far less contaminated due to their distance from major PCB sources. ”The only thing that gives me hope about killer whales in the longer term is, yes, we are going to lose populations all over the industrialised areas, but there are populations that are doing reasonably well in the Arctic,” said Jepson. If a global clean-up, which would take decades, can be achieved, these populations could eventually repopulate empty regions, he said, noting that killer whales are very intelligent, have strong family bonds and hunt in packs. “It is an incredibly adaptive species – they have been able to [live] from the Arctic to the Antarctic and everywhere in between.” He praised the billion-dollar “ superfund ” clean-ups in the US, such as in the Hudson River and Puget Sound, where the polluter has paid most of the costs: “The US is going way beyond the Stockholm Convention because they know how toxic PCBs are.”",816,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/orca-apocalypse-half-of-killer-whales-doomed-to-die-from-pollution
3,"The UN environment chief, under fire over huge travel expenses and rule-breaking, has been forced leave the UN general assembly in New York early and return to his Nairobi headquarters to deal with the growing crisis. The problems for Erik Solheim, Norwegian head of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), include the Netherlands becoming the latest nation to withhold millions of dollars in funding until the issues are resolved. The Guardian can also reveal that Solheim has now recused himself from professional dealings with his wife and a Norwegian company that employed her shortly after it signed a deal with Unep in April. Pressure is growing on Solheim after he was sharply criticised by a draft internal UN audit over his globe-trotting travels that called them “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction”. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and that he claimed unjustified expenses. The UN staff union in Nairobi, where Unep is headquartered, called some of the draft audit findings “mind-blowing”. Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and that he had made changes where other rules had been broken. Solheim wrote to all national ambassadors on the committee that oversees Unep work on Tuesday to tell them he was cutting short his New York trip and putting in place measures to increase the accountability of managers and their travel. “We will address issues of trust between management, our staff, member states and/or partners,” he said in a letter seen by the Guardian. Unep is governed by the UN environment assembly , the world highest-level decision-making body on the environment. Its president, Siim Kiisler, Estonia environment minister, told the Guardian the next steps to be taken would be decided when the internal audit was completed. “I need to ensure that member states have full trust that their resources are used for the benefit of the environment,” Kiisler said. “I will read the official report carefully, talk to Mr Solheim and after that form a standpoint.” He said Solheim travels had played an important role in making Unep visible, but added: “It certainly has too look and feel right as well, and of course, follow the rules of the system.” On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Dutch government told the Guardian: “A planned payment of will be held until Unep provides more clarity, and until it is clear that Unep is taking this matter seriously.” The job taken by Solheim wife, Gry Ulverud, is with the Norwegian company X Ocean , which aims to build the world biggest research ship as well as a “World Ocean Headquarter” near Oslo. On May, the company announced a memorandum of understanding with Unep , although Unep did not issue a press release. On June, Ulverud posted on her Facebook page: “Started New Job at at X – Manager for Strategy and Partnership”. The page has now been removed . “In relation to any notion of nepotism, I wish to clarify that my spouse was recruited to REV Ocean through an open, transparent and competitive process,” said Solheim. He said her recruitment was based on years of professional experience “with the Norwegian Refugee Council, as a diplomat, as deputy representative to Unesco from and over years with the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.” Solheim said he wrote to the UN Ethics Office for advice on the matter of his wife appointment on July and again on September, when he told it REV Ocean was giving Unep funding over four years. Solheim said he received the advice on September and wrote to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to recuse himself on September, the same day the Guardian first contacted him on the matter. Solheim said he and Ulverud would have no “direct bilateral interaction” when acting in their official capacities. He said all matters relating to REV Ocean would now be dealt with by the Unep deputy executive director. Nations halt funding to UN environment programme as outcry over chief grows The Guardian has also seen emails relating to an initial refusal to allow Ulverud to attend a Unep meeting on marine plastic litter in May, just before she started at REV Ocean. One senior manager advises Ulverud to ask an official for “assistance”. That official then asks colleagues: “Can we think of a creative way to have Gry join the meeting next week?” Ulverud was subsequently invited. “The available records do not indicate that Ms Ulverud used any influence to obtain access to the meeting other than being an employee of a private sector entity in partnership with Unep,” said Solheim. Her contract started just after the meeting took place, but a Unep spokesman said: “Her employer requested her to do a number of things before assuming her new functions, including attending the meeting in Nairobi.” The Guardian can be contacted securely here or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com",822,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/under-fire-un-environment-chief-forced-back-to-hq-erik-solheim
4,"Three environmental activists jailed for their part in an anti-fracking protest have released a video message promising they will win the battle against fracking. The men became the first to receive a custodial sentence for environmental protests against shale gas extraction this week. Simon Roscoe Blevins, and Richard Roberts, were given months in prison and Richard Loizou, was sentenced to months in jail on Wednesday after being convicted of causing a public nuisance by a jury at Preston crown court in August. In a message that has been released as the men wait in Preston prison to be moved to jails elsewhere in the country, Loizou said he would miss everything about his life outside while serving his sentence. But he added: “I think we will win, because this is a last-ditch attempt to squeeze the remaining fossil fuels from the earth. It is like industry clinging on to an old paradigm of the way things operate.” In the message, Roberts recounted his part in a four-day protest that blocked a convoy of trucks carrying drilling equipment from entering the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool. He said he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt when he climbed on to a truck, where he remained for four days. “I got on this lorry about o’clock in the morning … I was just in shorts and T-shirt. The only reason I was able to stay up there for three days and nights was because local people handed up clothing, sleeping bags, food…” The jailing of fracking protesters tells us we are winning this fight | Caroline Lucas The court heard this week that the jailing of the men meant they were the first to receive custodial sentences for environmental protest in the UK since the mass trespass on Kinder Scout in the Peak District in which marked the beginning of the right-to-roam movement. Another defendant, Julian Brock, was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to the same offence. At approximately on Tuesday July as seven lorries containing drilling equipment attempted to approach the site, Roberts, a piano restorer from London, got through a police cordon and climbed on top of the first lorry, bringing the convoy to a standstill. Loizou, a teacher from Devon, climbed on to the cab of the last lorry. At about Roscoe Blevins, a soil scientist from Sheffield, also climbed on to one of the lorries. In the early hours of the following morning, Brock also climbed on to a lorry in the convoy. Fellow protesters threw blankets, food and water up to the men as they camped out on the vehicles. Loizou came down on July at after hours. Blevins did the same at on July, having spent just over hours on his lorry. Roberts descended at the same day, after hours. Brock did not climb down from his lorry until July at after an estimated hours.

5,"hortly after sunset, along an isolated stretch of highway leading out of a dusty hamlet in northern Peru , a band of five weary farmers clad in reflective neon vests and armed with traditional whips made of bull penises set out on a solemn march. The Ronderos – self-governing peasant patrols – are resuming their nightly rounds five months after the brutal killing of their lieutenant governor , Napoléon Tarrillo Astonitas. “During all the years I’ve lived here, the situation has never been this threatening. The murder of the lieutenant governor in this hamlet made us organise in order to protect ourselves,” says Humberto Gonzales Núñez, head of Rondas Campesinas of El Mirador. El Mirador and the surrounding hamlets remain deeply shaken by the murder last December, living in terror as invaders continue to seize their land within the Chaparrí ecological reserve, one of Peru most biodiverse forests. “This hurts so much –my husband was my only family,” Flor Vallejos, Tarrillo widow, says. “He was a lovely person. He liked to defend our environment, our lands, and our dry forest. The animals, he loved them.’’ Land invaders turned their attention to Chaparrí six years ago when plans to build La Montería reservoir dangled the promise of water resources in a desert-like environment – raising the possibility of agricultural expansion in the protected area. To date, individuals opposing the plans have been threatened, and last year cases of suspicious forest fires were reported in Chaparrí. According to the head of Peru supreme court, Duberlí Rodríguez, more than hectares of the area have been affected by land grabbers – deforested, burned and illegally cultivated. The location of La Montería reservoir has been a controversial matter, since it is within the borders of the protected area, going against a resolution made by the environment ministry in . The head of Peru congressional environmental commission, María Elena Foronda, says the reservoir project has not been approved by the authorities governing protected areas, forests and wildlife, nor the environment ministry. “There have simply been acts of corruption,” she adds. An organised criminal network has its hold on the area, says Mar Pérez Aguilera, coordinator for the activist group National Coordinator for Human Rights, which is currently helping to keep Vallejos in hiding. She recounts four cases of murder tied to land grabbing in the area so far: that of Tarrillo, and those of three police officers in Salas two years ago . But the crimes are rarely prosecuted, and the perpetrators seldom face legal consequences. “Impunity is a message of support,” says Pérez. “We know that very powerful people are involved in this case, and that is making everything more difficult.” The case of Chaparrí is legally complex. According to Rodríguez, invaders have also infiltrated the community group of legal representatives known as the Administrative Directive, enabling an influx of nearly new members during the past six years. Many of them do not meet the normal criteria to join the group, he says. “It is the Administrative Directive itself that is promoting the disappearance of Chaparrí; they are enemies of the reserve,’’ Rodríguez says. Etlevina López Vásquez has been a community member for the majority of her life, and was also one of the founders of Chaparrí, but says she has found herself a target under the new authorities. She says she has been insulted, that her animals have been killed, and that the new members have tried to expel her from the community. “We have been very dedicated community members, but since the new directive came to power, the expulsions began, conflicts began, our voices were silenced – as if we did not exist,” she says. Tonight, López hears familiar voices among the barks of dogs while the Ronderos pass her hut. Halfway up the road the men all stiffen and throw each other anxious looks as headlights of an approaching car are spotted. Blowing on plastic whistles, they flank the vehicle as it slows to pull over. There is a sudden, collective sigh of relief – this time they know the driver, and wave him on.",683,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/03/peruvian-villagers-face-and-intimidation-from-land-traffickers
6,"Individually, they are stories of courage and tragedy. Together, they tell a tale of a natural world under ever more violent assault. The portraits in this series are of nine people who are risking their lives to defend the land and environment in some of the planet most remote or conflict-riven regions. 'God wants you to act on what in front of you': enforcing conservation law in the Coral Triangle From the Coral Triangle and the Sierra Madre to the Amazon and the Western African Savannah, they are caught up in struggles against illegal fishing, industrial farming, poachers, polluters and miners. The majority have seen colleagues, family or friends murdered or arrested. Two have bodyguards. Several say they wake up each day thankful to be alive. They are often criminalised, labelled terrorists or portrayed by their enemies as anti-development. All are determined to carry on their struggles despite almost ever-present and growing risks. 'You will never run from death': shot by poachers in Uganda Last year, a record defenders were murdered, according to a revised tally by Global Witness . Over the past months, the Guardian has published the names and, where possible, the faces and stories of the victims in this list. To mark a year of this unique collaboration, Cape Town-based photographer Thom Pierce has been commissioned to take portraits of defenders in some of the world worst affected regions. Although the campaigns often start locally and accidentally, several defenders saw themselves caught up in a bigger fight for the natural world. 'We have become guardians': Turkey accidental forest protectors “We didn’t realise this at first, but its global,” says Turkish forest defender Tuğba Günal. “If you want to protect the environment, you are treated as a terrorist. It everywhere now.” They are in the frontline of a battle between those who promote conservation and those who promote consumption. This conflict has become more violent as resources become scarcer. Extractive industries are financing the campaigns of a new generation of political strongmen: Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, Donald Trump in the United States and Jair Bolsonaro in BrazilAll are committed to eroding the few legal protections that environmental campaigners and indigenous groups are able to use to hold back mines, farms and factories. ​'A hitman could come and kill me': the fight for indigenous land rights in Mexico A large proportion of killings are linked to government security forces, particularly in the Philippines, which is the most dangerous country in Asia for activists. Many others are carried out by gangs, particularly in Latin America, which accounts for more than half of all deaths. “All these activists did was to question the way that business is done. They had the audacity to defend their rights and protect the environment. That they were murdered for that is a damning indictment of the way the goods we buy are produced,” said Ben Leather, a campaigner at Global Witness. “Governments and businesses are putting profits ahead of people and we, the consumers, should not just be outraged but push them to take responsibility.” 'I tended to the bodies': attacked by the Philippine army The regions with the greatest natural and ethnic diversity, have the worst records. Brazil, the biggest Amazon forest nation, has the most deaths followed by the Philippines, which is at the centre of the Coral Triangle. Next comes Colombia, another Amazon nation, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has Africa biggest forest, where almost all the victims were forest rangers. The greatest deterioration was in Mexico, where the government approval for mining and farming concessions in indigenous territory has contributed to a five-fold increase in deaths over the previous year. 'They should be put in prison': battling Brazil huge alumina plant Impunity is a major problem. Defenders are often cheated of land rights by corrupt lawmakers and local politicians. When they resist, they are criminalised. When they are killed, nobody gets punished. The majority of the defenders here – and in the global tallies – are from indigenous groups and poor black communities, who have been pushed over decades or centuries to the fringes of society. Not coincidentally, that is where nature is most abundant, where resources remain untapped, where the law – if it is applied at all – tends to serve as a tool for exploitation rather than justice. 'This is a last hold-out': Son of a murdered farmer in Colombia “It almost apartheid. Indigenous people are treated as nobodies,” said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur on indigenous rights, who was labelled a terrorist in her own country, the Philippines. “We can’t allow this to continue or the people who are working to protect the environment will disappear and those who extract will rule the world. We don’t want that.” These low-intensity conflicts rarely make headlines because they are rarely black-and-white, they do not threaten the status quo and because local authorities and the companies that supply us are implicated, albeit often indirectly. 'I thank god I am alive': standing firm against mineral extraction in South Africa Most of these activists are fighting against our short-term interests and for our long-term well-being. On one hand, they are resisting the extractive businesses that provide consumers with coffee, palm oil, fish and the titanium, aluminium and copper in our laptops, mobile phones and cars. On the other, they are the most effective guardians of global biodiversity and climate stability. Asked what message they have for readers, some urged consumers to shop carefully , to consider supply chains and boycott firms and products linked with violence. Most, though, said they needed broader political change – a greater global push for land rights, accountability, transparency, tighter regulations on companies and more efforts to punish the corrupt officials and gang bosses who are often behind the killings. They also seek more international exposure and solidarity in what is increasingly resembling a series of last stands for nature. 'We had no plans for violence': Indian campaign against toxic smelter turned deadly “Something in happening in the world. Activists are being branded as terrorists,” says Fatima Babu in India, who recently saw her campaign against a copper smelter explode into violence with the police killing of protesters. “This phenomenon of destroying people and the planet for profit is not just happening in India.

7,"ne morning in May, Matthew phone beeped. “Watch Sky News now. Pigs!” The footage was brutal; farm-workers kicking pigs in the face and head, jabbing them with pitchforks and laughing as they slammed a gate on to an animal head. The owners of the farm – the Godfrey family – immediately launched a full RSPCA-backed investigation. Four people at Fir Tree farm lost their jobs. The Godfreys said: “We are shocked by the actions of those involved as their abhorrent behaviour does not represent our business. We are a family-run farm where the care and welfare of our pigs is paramount.” A few weeks earlier Matthew had been working at Grange de Lings, one of the other farms belonging to the Godfreys’ company (Elsham Linc, one of the UK biggest pig producers with an annual turnover of While working there he’d seen treatment of the pigs that amounted, he believed, to serious neglect and abuse. He had some pictures he thought showed overcrowding on his phone: after watching the Fir Tree film he sent the photographs to his former manager, with a letter about his worries. Share your stories from inside the farming industry “I got a letter from the Godfrey family saying that they had shown my pictures to the RSPCA and they didn’t believe it was neglect,” he says. “They said to call them with any further concerns. I called several times and they never got back to me.” Speaking to the Guardian over a number of conversations and meetings, Matthew alleges he saw frequent rough treatment of pigs, sometimes verging on violence. One example was how pigs were moved around. “The contract says [to] move pigs at their own pace, quietly, but everybody walks around clapping and shouting. “One day [a colleague] had to move a pig into a horrible, rat-infested barn. The pig had backed itself into a corner and he stood over the pig, beating it over and over again in the ribs and on the snout with a board.” RSPCA to investigate Lincolnshire farm after 'workers filmed kicking pigs' He also claims he saw animals dying in pain because workers were not trained properly in humane killing. Matthew says he saw one pig being shot a number of times without being successfully killed: “It was on the floor … it was horrible to see.” The Godfrey family strongly deny his allegations. They declined to speak directly to the Guardian, communicating through Liam Herbert, their PR manager, and Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association. Both said full investigations, including interviewing staff at Grange de Lings, showed none of the allegations were true. They insisted that Matthew is an unreliable source. Matthew does not believe the Godfreys knew what was going on. And neither does Ash, another source with professional links to farming who has also spoken to the Guardian. This individual believes that the footage of Fir Tree farm didn’t tell the full story of how widespread poor attitudes were. Ash saw examples of violence, such as pigs being hit over the head with wooden boards. “I saw workers put their fingers in pigs’ eyes while moving them … it was just to make them move.” *** Matthew had lost his stockman job after falling out with management, partly over an injury he says he received while using the wrong equipment to detag a pig. He has opened a legal case against the farm. Both sides have their own version of events. But after the Guardian spoke to the Godfrey family about the allegations, Matthew did get a phone call from Alex Godfrey asking what had happened on the farm. He listed what he claims were the issues on the farm. “He listened to everything and wanted to hear what I had to say.” Speaking on the family behalf, Davies is passionate in their defence: “I know the family – these are good people, the impact on them has been immense. As soon as [allegations] came to light they acted very swiftly to identify and deal with shortcomings. They were absolutely horrified to find out things at Fir Tree hadn’t been the way they expected. All the farms were checked, all the staff individually interviewed.” Responding to specific allegations of mishandling, she said checking the way pigs are physically moved around is difficult. “There are very strict guidelines on how you should behave with animals but when actions go outside that, it difficult. An audit wouldn’t pick that up, people won’t behave like that when you do an inspection.” Video monitoring is being considered. But she dismissed the idea that untrained staff would euthanise animals. “That is a total breach of Red Tractor [quality assurance] standards. You have to have documented evidence that there are people on that farm trained to euthanise pigs. You would never have a farm situation where nobody was trained to euthanise an animal that was in pain.” ‘Stockmen are working … in shitty conditions’ Since the Fir Tree footage, a number of stories about alleged animal mistreatment on UK farms have emerged. In July, the Times ran “Farm animals tortured under Red Tractor label”, pointing to poor welfare conditions at seven different pig farms operating under the Red Tractor quality assurance mark . In August footage came to light from an organic dairy farm in Somerset that appeared to show calves being force-fed and hit. There is no openly available information on similar incidents. Red Tractor keeps data on farm performance but doesn’t publish it. But a contributory factor to abusive behaviour towards animals could be the impact of the conditions in intensive farms on the mental health of their workers. Farm workers nationally struggle with mental health. According to the Office for National Statistics , rates of farmers taking their own lives are among the highest for any occupational group. The risk was almost twice the national average among those working in specific agricultural roles such as rearing animals. Ash says: “Pig farmers, stockmen … are working in shitty conditions on a shitty wage. [It is the] perceived lowest of the low in farming. And I think they blame the pigs for their situation … that how I can put it.” Some believe that large-scale farming will always bring with it the risk of poor conditions. One organic farmer in Lincolnshire told the Guardian that this, rather than cruelty, was to blame. “You can’t blame owners … It a knock-on effect of being that big, of having that scale of farm. I look out the window now and our pigs’ tails are wagging in the sunshine. But it very difficult to make a living farming as we do.” Critics say standards regime is failing The revelations of the past few months raise serious questions around the current inspection system for farm welfare standards. Davies says owners want to know what is going on at their farm and says that the Godfrey family were pleased the original Fir Tree whistleblower came forward. “The family believe that the whistleblower did the right thing. They don’t want to know who it is. They don’t want [a] culture where staff don’t feel they can come forward.” She argues that workers such as Matthew who want to report their employers have options open to them. “[The industry has] a confidential reporting service, and there are posters up. If you are unhappy with anything in terms of welfare or someone you are working with you can call and report. We have had no calls to that number so I am disappointed an adult would choose to go to the media.” Matthew says he had no idea a reporting system existed and, as a new recruit in a small team, he didn’t feel there was anyone he could speak to. The industry also has food labels and logos to inform consumers about what they are buying. But these stories bring the effectiveness of such measures into question. Red Tractor is run and paid for by food producers and promises consumers “peace of mind” and a “cast iron guarantee” of high-welfare meat. But as the Times revealed, only one in Red Tractor visits are currently unannounced. Red Tractor has now said that it will bring in unannounced visits, although only after concerns are flagged up to its inspectors on pre-arranged inspections. Critics of the current standards regime say this is not good enough. Toni Shephard, head of Animal Equality, the organisation that filmed the footage on Fir Tree, told the Guardian that the public are often unaware of the realities of large-scale farming. She believes that much of what Matthew found distressing is – sadly, in her eyes – normal practice on British farms. “We are told we have the highest welfare standards in the world. But we get fairly regular calls from concerned individuals who have had professional contact with a farm and were shocked by what they saw. Workmen, electricians, all sorts of people get in touch and are shocked at the reality of factory farming. We have to tell them it completely legal.” Matthew admits that his expectations of working with farm animals didn’t match the reality. “I did my college training on a farm where the public could come and meet the pigs. They treated the pigs nicely, didn’t clip their teeth, didn’t keep them in crates.” Shephard laughs at the idea that pigs would be treated like that in high-intensity farming. “We kill million pigs a year in Britain – my garden would be full of pigs, there would be pigs everywhere if we wanted to give them that sort of space.” Names and identities have been changed",1609,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/alleged-beatings-abuse-uk-pig-farms
8,"ric Phelps steered a small, battery-powered pontoon boat over the tops of cornstalks and into the eastern North Carolina town of Wallace on Thursday afternoon. The smell of floodwater under a hot sun – a mix of oil, manure and mold – was overwhelming. Gliding across the surface, Phelps saw something even more unsettling: dead chickens, hundreds of them, lodged against people fences, stuck in the tops of bushes, lapping up against front porch steps. They are among the million chickens confirmed killed in the floods that followed Hurricane Florence . In addition, about hogs died, according to the Department of Agriculture, and some of the massive lagoons that hold their excrement are damaged and discharging a fecal soup. “Heartbreaking,” said Phelps, a manager for Brother Wolf Animal Rescue in western North Carolina, who had been hoping to rescue cats and dogs left behind before the storm. “You drive along the interstate and you don’t see any water and you think, “Oh, it fine.” But you turn off and you drive two miles close to the Cape Fear river and everything on the riverbank for miles around is covered by water. Houses, hog farms, fire stations, whatever.” Top: A flooded farm in North Carolina. Below left: There are million chickens confirmed killed in the state. Below right: Hurricane Florence dropped trillion gallons of water. Duplin county is part of a region that anchors America industrial farming industry. Here, livestock are considered inventory, raised for a nation that has tripled its poultry consumption over the past two generations and boosted pork consumption to its highest level since the North Carolina has million hogs and million chickens. It ranks second among US states in pounds of meat chicken produced each year, and second in number of hogs. Most of the farms contract with massive agribusinesses, such as Smithfield Foods and Sanderson Farms. The extent of the damage from Florence, which dropped trillion gallons of water on the state, is unknown. The state department of environmental quality reported Thursday that at least six swine lagoons have suffered structural damage, and have reported discharges. At least three of those with structural damage have been breached – the worst-case scenario, in which walls collapse. One released million gallons in Duplin county, a department spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal. Duke Energy confirmed Friday that a dam breached at one of its plants, alerting residents that coal ash may be flowing into the Cape Fear river. Yet the North Carolina Pork Council argues that activists overstate damage in order to cause alarm. “While we are dismayed by the release of some liquids from some lagoons, we also understand that what has been released from the farms is the result of a once-in-a-lifetime storm and that the contents are highly diluted with rainwater,” the council stated on its website. Cows take refuge from floodwaters on a porch in Wallace, North Carolina. The hog industry has been on the defensive in recent years, facing multiple lawsuits from residents in nearby towns who’ve found feces on their property and the smell on their clothes. Neighbors of farms owned by Murphy-Brown LLC, the largest hog producer in the world and a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, have brought nuisance lawsuits. Juries reached guilty verdicts in three of those cases so far, awarding in damages to plaintiffs. Because of the state cap on punitive damages, the awards have been reduced to about total. Following a hurricane that dropped inches of rain, investigations into the factory farm industry found lagoons located in flood-prone areas, poor working conditions, and waste-removal practices that hadn’t been updated in decades. The state responded by starting a program to buy hog farms in flood zones and relocate them. It is practically the only course of action that the government, activists, and the pork council all agree on, and it appears to have worked. Floyd dropped far less rain than Florence, but it killed four times the number of hogs: Most news reports during the storm focused on the devastation in the coastal towns of Wilmington and New Bern, but the flat area inland has remained largely unreachable by car. Experts remain deeply concerned because of rivers that are higher than ever this week. The Cape Fear, for instance, crested at a record feet near the inland city of Fayetteville on Wednesday. That water still had or so miles to travel before reaching the Atlantic and residents were ordered to evacuate Thursday night,eight days after Florence tropical force winds came ashore. Top: A flooded farm in Wallace, North Carolina. Below: North Carolina ranks second among US states in pounds of meat chicken produced each year and is home to million hogs. Florence timing could hardly be worse. It is the height of harvest season – with tobacco, peanuts, cotton, and sweet potatoes still in the ground – and there less than a month before the state fair celebration. From the driver seat of his boat on Thursday in Wallace, Phelps and his team couldn’t believe the number of animal carcasses they were seeing. He has rescued a few dogs and cats this week, and found dead ones, too. On Thursday, he passed cows standing on a front porch. Phelps’ thoughts have turned to the cleanup. Residents will return to destroyed homes, and many will discover dead chickens on their lawns and in sheds, legs askew, their faces down in the oily water.

9,"Antibiotics crucial to human medicine are still being used in “unacceptable” quantities on US livestock farms, despite rules brought in last year to curb their use and combat the spread of deadly superbugs. Tests on thousands of meat samples by the US Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) show that powerful antibiotics classified as “critically important” to human health are still being used. The widespread use of such drugs on livestock is one of the key drivers of antibiotic resistance, a growing public health crisis. Regulations brought in by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January banned the use of antibiotics on livestock without a prescription from a vet and made it illegal to use the drugs solely to make animals fatter, which for years had been common practice on industrial farms. The new rules aimed to ensure antibiotics were only used when medically necessary. But tests on livestock slaughtered at dozens of US meat packing plants – including some operated by major processors such as Tyson, Cargill and JBS – found “critical” antibiotics were still in use in many meat supply chains. There had been no reduction in the number of antibiotics found in samples from the year before the regulations came into effect. Analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism also shows how a loophole allows US farmers to continue to use many antibiotics targeted by the ban in much the same way as they could before the ban, including drugs previously used for growth promotion. The findings indicate that more needs to be done to combat overuse of antibiotics on farms, critics say. But meat industry representatives said it was impossible to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. The samples only indicated the presence of antibiotics, they pointed out, with no information about what diseases were involved or how the drugs were administered. All the drugs in question were approved for use on animals by the FDA. ‘Last defence’ against deadly infections Unpublished FSIS records spanning a four-year period between and detail the results of the official chemical residue testing programme at US meat plants, in which samples per year were analysed for substances that could potentially have an impact on human health. The data, obtained by the Bureau and the Guardian, showed that separate antibiotics classed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “critically important” to human medicine were still being used in meat supply chains. Rise in antibiotic resistance must be tackled, says top medic Of these, nine are classified as being “highest priority critically important”. The WHO recently warned that this class of antibiotics is so essential to human medicine that they should no longer be used in livestock farming. The antibiotics involved are often “the last line, or one of limited treatments, available to treat serious bacterial infections in humans”, it said. Overuse of antibiotics enables bacteria to develop resistance, meaning drugs will no longer work. Antibiotic resistance is one of the gravest public health threats facing the world, and is said to be responsible for the deaths of Americans each year , and a further people around the world . (For comparison, about people were killed in car accidents in the US in The FSIS data also showed that there had been no reduction in the number of antibiotics that turned up during testing. In the year before the restrictions came into force, the number of residues of “highest priority critically important” antibiotics was The number actually increased after the new restrictions came into force, to in More than meat plants were found to have at least one “critically important” antibiotic in use within their supply chains. A total of plants had five or more, and had nine or more. Some of the plants at which samples were tested are operated by major US processors. Medical experts and pressure groups said the findings showed much more needed to be done, and that meat companies should pressure farms to reduce antibiotic use. “It is absolutely crucial that these practices end,” said Dr Thomas Van Boeckel, a scientist from the Swiss university ETH Zurich, who has mapped the use of antibiotics in animals globally. Livestock treatment may offer solution to antibiotics crisis, say scientists It was “not acceptable” that some supply chains involved the use of critically important antibiotics. “When meat producers misuse antibiotics important to human medicine, especially those that are considered critically important, resistant bacteria can rapidly multiply, spread off the farm, and potentially infect people with dangerous illness,” said Matt Wellington, antibiotics campaign director of the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). “If we lose these life-saving antibiotics, we lose the foundations of our modern medical system.” ‘Vets know when these drugs should be used’ Critics say there is a serious loophole in FDA regulations to curb the overuse of antibiotics in US agriculture. The Guardian looked at all antibiotics available today that were previously used to make livestock fatter. We found most of these antibiotics can still be fed to animals for an unlimited period, despite the new FDA rules. Meat producers warn that restrictions could endanger animal welfare. “The antibiotics in question are approved by the FDA for use in animals with oversight from a veterinarian,” said a spokesperson from the North American Meat Institute (Nami). “We believe judicious use of approved antibiotics in this manner with expert guidance from veterinarians to maintain animal health and welfare is appropriate.” Tiffany Lee, a Nami vet, said vets would not prescribe drugs without good cause. “Veterinarians know the difference between growth promotion and antibiotics for disease prevention, and they understand that they are prescribing these antibiotics for disease prevention,” she said. FDA figures due in December The US meat industry points out that all drugs are FDA-approved and insists they are being used appropriately. “Antibiotic residues are extremely rare and meat is safe. To make any other sweeping public health conclusions from the residue testing data is inappropriate and irresponsible,” said a Nami spokesperson. The FDA is planning to release data on pharmaceutical sales for animal antibiotics for this December, which will give more indication of the effectiveness of the new regulations. Tyson told the Bureau: “We’ve held meetings with livestock farmers and ranchers on antibiotic stewardship and funded research on removing antibiotics important to humans from cattle production. We also continue to explore new ways to engage farmers, ranchers and others in the discussion about alternatives to antibiotics that are also important to humans.” The other companies did not respond.",1080,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/19/crucial-antibiotics-still-used-on-us-farms-despite-public-health-fears
10,"“For me, there are two very important anthropological concepts,” says Patrick Friesen, speaking Spanish with a thick accent. He is a descendant of protestant Mennonites who left Europe to found agricultural colonies in the arid region of the Paraguayan Chaco; he is also the communication manager of Chortitzer, one of the three large Mennonite cooperatives that dominate the economy of this inhospitable part of the country. “The first [concept] is that people from the north[ern hemisphere] need to stockpile. They work from sunrise to sunset, investing, so they can survive the winter. But a person from the south, to put it crudely, can sit under a mango tree and wait for a mango to fall on his head. Nature provides security,” he says, differentiating what he believes to be the mental maps of the Mennonites and the indigenous peoples who have been living together in the Chaco for a century. Formed by dry forests resistant to drought and scalding temperatures, the Chaco occupies more than half the land in Paraguay . Over the past decade, cattle farming in this region has grown rapidly and it now has of the country livestock population, and is increasingly becoming the crucible of Paraguay growing export industry, selling soybeans, meat and leather to the rest of the world. But as Paraguay export market develops and the country becomes a bigger player in the international market, the darker side of the Chaco region is coming into focus, with reports of illegal deforestation and slave labour among the indigenous population. So far only one case has actually resulted in a conviction. In November on a farm called Estância Ruroka, government inspectors found people working and living in inhumane conditions on a farm in the department of Boquerón, near the border with Bolivia. The workers were Aché people recruited nearly a thousand kilometres from their communities to produce charcoal from native forest felled to prepare the way for grassland. The group included children and adolescents with injuries on their hands caused by the charcoal kilns. Sleeping on mattresses on the ground and protected from the sun only by plastic tarpaulins, the group did not have enough drinking water to quench their thirst, though temperatures can reach in the Chaco. The workers were also in debt to pay for food from the recruiters. In an attempt to save money, they even went without dinner. The inspection was carried out by the public prosecutor office after they received a complaint. “The situation needs to be under much stricter control,” says Teresa Martínez, Paraguay public prosecutor. “If it not watched, these things will continue to happen. In this case, we went because they asked for help. But we have a problem: the inspectors cannot enter without a warrant. And for us to get this warrant, we need to intervene [through the courts].” The working conditions in the region, she argues, are “a form of slave labour… They work in camps, move from one place to another on farms, with their things. All they have to use, kitchen utensils, sleeping things, everything they have to buy. The foremen deduct this from what they have to receive as wages. And they usually do not pay until the six months are over so they do not leave. So they stay until they meet the deadline they told them. And when they get six months they owe a lot of money for the food, the clothes, the boots. It really a form of slavery.” But there are numerous obstacles in the way of effective oversight, not least the fact that even the most senior Paraguayan authorities are reluctant to admit there is a problem. It is not difficult to find public statements by government ministers of former president Horacio Cartes – himself a big landowner and rancher in the Chaco – playing down or even denying the existence of slave labour. As one local governor said : “Many people come here from different regions looking for work. Here they will only find good work and good pay.” But the nature of the global market is such that these problems no longer stay local. The long twisted tendrils of global supply chains can now stretch all the way from the dusty empty roads of the Chaco tosome of the best known brands in the world – even when those brands are based in glossy, glassy European headquarters half a planet away. A joint investigation by Repórter Brasil and the Guardian uncovered potential links between Estancia Ruroka and some of the world largest car firms, including BMW, Citroën, Peugeot and Renault. All four have been supplied with leather either directly or indirectly by Cencoprod, a company run by the three Mennonite cooperatives that dominate the economy of the Chaco, one of which is Chortitzer. The farmer convicted of trafficking - Rudi Kauenhowen Friesen - is an associate of Chortitzer. Repórter Brasil and the Guardian approached the car firms about the case. BMW said it was unaware of the conviction involving an associate of the Chortitzer cooperative, but confirmed that one of its leather suppliers purchased materials from Cencoprod. “In cases like this, we conduct an investigation with our direct supplier to check the facts,” the company said. “The BMW Group definitively does not tolerate any kind of violation of human rights in its production chains.” BMW said the Ruroka ranch – where the slave labour was found – was not a supplier of Cencoprod and, therefore, was not directly involved in its supply chain. Renault and the PSA group (responsible for the Citroën and Peugeot brands) stated that their leather supplier – the Italian company Italthierry Auto Leather Spa – stopped buying from Cencoprod in Renault reaffirmed their commitment to “have an active sustainable purchasing policy encompassing respect for human rights, labor law, compliance, safety, quality and the environment”. But Europe remains a vital market for Paraguayan leather, with hundreds of tonnes being shipped into Italy alone in the last year. And while the Chaco area remains so under-regulated it is a risk European companies cannot continue to ignore. Cencoprod and Italthierry were approached but did not comment. Traceability The economy of the Paraguayan Chaco revolves around cattle farming. According to a study conducted by the environmental organisation Guyra, one third of the native vegetation in the region has already been transformed into grassland. “What concerns us the most is that nearly of the deforestation is completely illegal,” said Alberto Yanoski, director of Guyra. The urban centres founded by Mennonite colonists are home to more than descendants of European immigrants. In these cities, it is not unusual to come across traffic signs in German. It is also common to see children with light eyes and fair hair playing in well-kept gardens. On the weekends, the Protestant churches are filled with Mennonites. The headquarters of the three Mennonite cooperatives that dominate the economy of the Chaco are also located in this region. Besides competing in the beef industry with their own processing plants, they also operate in the leather market through Cencoprod. Tackling issues of traceability and sustainability has been a major focus in recent years, says Chortitzer communication manager Friesen. “Obviously, the customer is king. If the customer wants traceability, then we have to comply,” he says. “We have very strict rules regarding the traceability of livestock and the by-products.” However, he says, Chortitzer was not buying livestock from Estancia Ruroka, and so those systems did not apply. It is an extremely large cooperative, Friesen explains. “Chortitzer is responsible for promoting the socio-economic development of some partners, providing them with all services in the production, processing and sale of products in the local, national and international markets.” “We as a cooperative do not, as a rule, require our partners to do anything,” he says. When asked about the Ruroka case, he replies: “We can encourage them, motivate them and also tell the member that they will face the legal consequences. We do not protect them if they do something wrong.” As he points out, “the cooperative is not a police entity, or a citizen control body.” He hopes that the Paraguayan state willstep up its oversight in the Chaco region. “Paraguay branding is in the hands not only of the private sector, but also of the government,” he said. In March this year, the Paraguayan ministry of labour opened an office in the city of Filadelfia specifically to receive complaints from indigenous people. The sole employee in the office is Erundina Gómez, an indigenous woman whose father “worked for years at a farm and never got paid a dime”. She knows that the situation experienced by her father still occurs today. In February this year, four indigenous teenagers aged to were found by the police on a farm where they had been abandoned by a recruiter without food or water. They had been brought in to produce charcoal at a farm owned by a Mennonite colonist in the region. In September, the United Nations is expected to release an official report on slave labour in the Paraguayan Chaco.",1512,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/forced-labour-in-paraguay-the-darkness-at-the-bottom-of-the-global-supply-chain
11,"In this warming world, some parts of the planet are warming much faster than others.&nbsp; The warming is causing large ice bodies to start to melt and move rapidly, in some cases sliding into the ocean.&nbsp; This movement is the topic of a very new scientific study that was just published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters . &nbsp;The Arctic is warming much faster than other parts of the planet and the ice there is showing the signs of rapid warming.&nbsp; This fact has serious consequences. First, melting ice can cause sea levels to rise and inundate coastal areas – it also makes storms like hurricanes and typhoons more destructive.&nbsp; Melting ice also causes a feedback loop, which can cause more future warming and then more ice loss. It should be noted that there are different types of ice.&nbsp; Some ice floats on water and is called sea ice .&nbsp; When it melts, the ocean water level hardly budges because the ice is already in the sea displacing liquid water.&nbsp; But, sea ice is really important for this feedback loop I mentioned above. Other ice is on land and may be a large ice sheet or a smaller glacier.&nbsp; These ice bodies sit atop the land and “rest” there.&nbsp; In some cases, they extend out off the land and into the ocean where they partly float on liquid water.&nbsp; When this land ice melts, the liquid flows into the oceans and can cause significant ocean level rising. So, the importance of ice depends on what type it is, where it is located, and how fast it is melting. And this brings us to the new paper . The researchers looked at a type of high latitude glacier in their study.&nbsp; These glaciers hold enough water to cause about foot (about a third of a meter) in sea level rise. Typically, they exist in cold and dry areas, where snowfall is limited.&nbsp; How do glaciers move?&nbsp; Well really by either sliding over the underlying bedrock or surface that they sit on, or by deforming and stretching under their weight. The colder glaciers tend to move by the deforming and stretching process.&nbsp; Glaciers that have wetter and more temperate regions involve more sliding.&nbsp; But regardless of how they move, these glaciers, particularly the glaciers that have both cold and temperate parts, experience surges in their motion.&nbsp; These surges are short duration times where the glacier moves a lot.&nbsp; During a surge, ice is redistributed from one part of the glacier to another region. The authors in this study observed such a glacier surge.&nbsp; It happened at an outlet glacier that is mainly of the “cold” type in Russia.&nbsp; At the Vavilov Ice Cap on October Revolution Island, the authors find it “is undergoing extraordinary acceleration and thinning but displays no previous evidence of surging.”&nbsp; The authors write, the meter thick square kilometer Vavilov Ice Cap is frozen to its bed over the majority of its area, apart from a region along its western margin where basal sliding is potentially important for faster flow . In the ice in the region began to accelerate and the next year, crevasses were observed that matched the patterns of ice acceleration. The researchers were able to watch this surge in ice motion in real-time using satellite images. They could track the motion and show the incredible speed of flow.&nbsp; What caused the rapid motion? This is an important question because if the motion is caused by human warming, we can expect the behavior to be repeated elsewhere as temperatures rise.&nbsp; Importantly both air and ocean-water temperatures could be a factor.&nbsp; One potential cause is surface meltwater.&nbsp; The top of the ice can melt, and liquid water then can flow downwards, into the ice through cracks and holes.&nbsp; This flowing water can precondition the ice for rapid motion. This fact may be a contributing cause to the motion.&nbsp; Basically, the melted water lubricated the ice/ground interface causing more sliding and more friction.&nbsp; The friction caused some of the bottom ice to melt and released more liquid water, and a cycle had begun. The researchers also took measurements of elevation to better understand areas where ice was becoming thicker or thinner.&nbsp; In addition, they studied the forces that exist within the ice itself to help elucidate the cause of the increased speed. Obviously, this is an evolving area of study and all of the questions have not yet been answered.&nbsp; However, I was impressed when I read that even though these types of surges are becoming more common, what the researchers observed in Russia was still unique.&nbsp; They describe the rate of ice loss at Vavilov as “extreme.” The authors also point out, It is startling that the Vavilov Ice Cap, until recently, an apparently stable ice cap with an almost entirely frozen bed that is almost entirely above sea level, is able to rapidly discharge such a large proportion of its ice in the ocean over such a short period . So, to answer the question, how fast is it moving?&nbsp; In it reached speeds of up to feet in a single day. It currently is sliding feet a day. For comparison, that is much faster than the average inches per day we would see with no surge events. The takeaway message is that once we thought these large bodies of ice responded slowly to changing conditions.&nbsp; But this research shows us differently.&nbsp; It shows that ice sheet can move quickly and once we pass a threshold, they may be hard to stop.&nbsp; This finding makes it more crucial for us to slow down global warming before it too late.",945,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/26/new-research-shows-the-worlds-ice-is-doing-something-not-seen-before
12,"We’re currently on pace to double the carbon dioxide-equivalent (including other greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere by around mid-century.&nbsp; Since the late scientists have been trying to answer the question, how much global warming will that cause? In top climate scientists led by Jule Charney published a report estimating that if we double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from pre-industrial levels of ppm to ppm, temperatures will warm by ± Four decades later, ‘ climate sensitivity ’ estimates remain virtually unchanged, but some climate contrarians have argued that the number is at the low end of that range, around or less. It an important question because if the contrarians are right, the resulting global warming would represent significantly less severe climate change consequences than if mainstream climate scientists are right and temperatures rise by It would also mean our remaining carbon budget for meeting the Paris target is about twice as large than if the mainstream consensus is right.&nbsp; If the consensus is correct, we’re on pace to blow through the remaining Paris carbon budget by around Another nail in the contrarian ‘low sensitivity’ coffin Studies published in March , May , and December identified two critical flaws in the contrarians’ preferred so-called ‘energy balance model’ approach: it doesn’t account for the fact that Earth sensitivity can change over time, for example as large ice sheets continue to melt, or that the planet responds differently to different climate ‘forcings’ . Last week, the journal Earth Future published a study by the University of Southampton Philip Goodwin that took both of these factors into account.&nbsp; Goodwin ran climate model simulations treating every forcing separately, including changes in greenhouse gases, solar activity, particulates from volcanic eruptions, and from human fossil fuel combustion.&nbsp; For each, he included feedbacks from changes in factors like atmospheric water vapor, clouds, snow, and sea ice, including how these factors change over different timescales, as Goodwin explained: I ran million simulations with a&nbsp;relatively simple climate model. These million simulations each used different climate feedback strengths, and so the way that climate sensitivity responded over time was different in each simulation.&nbsp; To check which of the million simulations were most realistic, I checked each simulation against observations of warming in the atmosphere and ocean up to the present day. I kept only the simulations that agreed with the observations for the real world. This left simulations, where the values of the climate sensitivity (and changes in climate sensitivity over different timescales) agree with the atmosphere and ocean warming observed so far. It is from these final simulations that evaluate how the climate sensitivity evolves over time. Essentially, adding up all of the warming contributions from all of these factors at any given time tells us how sensitive the climate is on that timescale, whether it be a month, a year, a decade, or a century after atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have doubled.&nbsp; Over the shortest timeframes of a year or less, Goodwin found that temperatures will rise by about once carbon dioxide levels have doubled, consistent with the conclusions of the contrarian studies.&nbsp; That makes sense because those studies applied current climate measurements into energy balance models, but since carbon pollution is still rising, the climate still has a large energy imbalance.&nbsp; Climate sensitivity, on the other hand, is usually evaluated at the point when the Earth reaches a new energy equilibrium, long after carbon dioxide levels have stopped rising. Once our carbon pollution levels decline close to zero ( hopefully by mid-to-late century ), the planet will start to reach that new equilibrium.&nbsp; The slower feedbacks like melting ice will continue to kick in, and Goodwin found that on timescales close to a century thereafter, temperatures will rise by most likely consistent with mainstream climate science estimates since the Charney report. We need to hit the brakes or blow past Paris In other words, we are indeed on track to burn through the remaining Paris carbon budget by and under current international climate policies, we’re most likely headed for about warming by .&nbsp; Climate contrarians want to gamble on the long shot that the climate sensitivity is on the low end of the possible range, which would give us a few extra decades before we burn past the Paris target.&nbsp; But even that relatively rosy scenario would require more aggressive international climate policies than are in place today.&nbsp; We still have to change course even to limit ourselves to a doubling of carbon dioxide-equivalent in the atmosphere. And the body of scientific research keeps refuting the contrarian case.&nbsp; If anything, recent research suggests the climate sensitivity is toward the high end of the possible range , but Goodwin study finds that it most likely right where climate scientists have expected for decades. As Goodwin concluded, some of the lowest estimates of climate sensitivity from before do not appear to hold on the long timescales",819,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/24/new-study-reconciles-a-dispute-about-how-fast-global-warming-will-happen
13,"n a blustery September day two years into his mayoralty of London, Sadiq Khan appears atop a Santander cycle to open a stretch of kerb-protected bike lane – the extension of cycle superhighway from Farringdon to Kings Cross. It may be the first time he appeared officially on a bike since his election campaign but he seems genuinely passionate about cycling and walking, and has clearly done his homework – even if some of his stats don’t tell the whole story. Flanked by his deputy mayor for transport, Heidi Alexander, and his walking and cycling commissioner, Will Norman, Khan is bullish about his cycling record. This despite ongoing criticism over delays, and a bruising exchange with Westminster city council this summer – the council he brands “anti-walking, anti-cycling” after it blocked cycle superhighway and Oxford Street pedestrianisation in quick succession. Given the time it taken to get this far, many Londoners wonder how he will meet his pre-election pledge to triple to miles the length of protected cycle routes built by his predecessor, Boris Johnson. With commuters on bikes streaming past on the new cycle tracks and pedestrians using the improved crossings, Khan talks quickly, sweeping away criticism of slow progress. “In the first two years – you mention the previous guy – we have built of new cycle infrastructure,” says Khan. “This is of a cycle superhighway. It took the previous guy six years to do one mile, so I’m happy to compare myself to Boris all day long.” Although Khan is correct (he counting cycle tracks in both directions), the London Cycling Campaign (LCC) argues he should be averaging out mileage completed in Johnson last two years of mayoralty– not least given that most, if not all, of the schemes Khan is counting for himself were started by the previous administration. Then there the fact that about of the routes Khan is claiming, are cycle quietways, some of which are problematic to the point that Johnson cycling commissioner, who started them off, has branded the scheme a failure . Although some sections of routes are good, the LCC says “just about every single quietway we have seen has major issues”, from dangerous junctions to high traffic volumes and speeds, because boroughs are unwilling to restrict motor traffic. is popular, though, even if imperfect – leaving the main road a couple of times to zig-zag on back streets – and huge numbers of people on bikes accumulate at each phase of the traffic lights. Khan seems to “get” cycling as a viable method of mass transport, and recognises that things need to get moving. “Look at the evidence”, he says. “The fastest form of transport in London is cycling. In central London there are more than half a million kilometres cycled each day. “We need to accelerate that progress. We need more people walking and cycling. Why? Our city is growing. It not possible in the future for million Londoners to drive across our city – but also the air quality in London is a killer.” He cites evidence that shows bike lanes are good for local businesses too: “The businesses that thrive and flourish are [those which see] more people walking and cycling, stopping by, having a coffee, stopping to buy something from the shop. “There a health case, there a business case, but also, you know what? It enjoyable too.” Behind the scenes, Khan team have delivered the mayor transport strategy, and a massive restructuring of TfL; they have a new and passionate deputy mayor for transport in Heidi Alexander.

14,"One day in an American economist named Daniel Ellsberg stumbled across a piece of paper with apocalyptic implications. Ellsberg, who was advising the US government on its secret nuclear war plans, had discovered a document that contained an official estimate of the death toll in a preemptive “first strike” on China and the Soviet Union: million in those countries, and double that globally. Ellsberg was troubled that such a plan existed; years later, he tried to leak the details of nuclear annihilation to the public. Although his attempt failed, Ellsberg would become famous instead for leaking what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers – the US government secret history of its military intervention in Vietnam. America amoral military planning during the Cold War echoes the hubris exhibited by another cast of characters gambling with the fate of humanity. Recently, secret documents have been unearthed detailing what the energy industry knew about the links between their products and global warming. But, unlike the government nuclear plans, what the industry detailed was put into action. In the oil companies like Exxon and Shell carried out internal assessments of the carbon dioxide released by fossil fuels, and forecast the planetary consequences of these emissions. In for example, Exxon predicted that by about CO levels would reach around parts per million – double the preindustrial level – and that this would push the planet average temperatures up by about over then-current levels (and even more compared to pre-industrial levels). Later that decade, in an internal report by Shell projected similar effects but also found that CO could double even earlier, by Privately, these companies did not dispute the links between their products, global warming, and ecological calamity. On the contrary, their research confirmed the connections. Shell assessment foresaw a one-meter sea-level rise, and noted that warming could also fuel disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, resulting in a worldwide rise in sea level of “five to six meters.” That would be enough to inundate entire low-lying countries. Shell analysts also warned of the “disappearance of specific ecosystems or habitat destruction,” predicted an increase in “runoff, destructive floods, and inundation of low-lying farmland,” and said that “new sources of freshwater would be required” to compensate for changes in precipitation. Global changes in air temperature would also “drastically change the way people live and work.” All told, Shell concluded, “the changes may be the greatest in recorded history.” For its part, Exxon warned of “potentially catastrophic events that must be considered.” Like Shell experts, Exxon scientists predicted devastating sea-level rise, and warned that the American Midwest and other parts of the world could become desert-like. Looking on the bright side, the company expressed its confidence that “this problem is not as significant to mankind as a nuclear holocaust or world famine.” The documents make for frightening reading. And the effect is all the more chilling in view of the oil giants’ refusal to warn the public about the damage that their own researchers predicted. Shell report, marked “confidential,” was first disclosed by a Dutch news organization earlier this year. Exxon study was not intended for external distribution, either; it was leaked in . Nor did the companies ever take responsibility for their products. In Shell study, the firm argued that the “main burden” of addressing climate change rests not with the energy industry, but with governments and consumers. That argument might have made sense if oil executives, including those from Exxon and Shell, had not later lied about climate change and actively prevented governments from enacting clean-energy policies. Although the details of global warming were foreign to most people in the among the few who had a better idea than most were the companies contributing the most to it. Despite scientific uncertainties, the bottom line was this: oil firms recognized that their products added CO to the atmosphere, understood that this would lead to warming, and calculated the likely consequences. And then they chose to accept those risks on our behalf, at our expense, and without our knowledge. The catastrophic nuclear war plans that Ellsberg saw in the were a Sword of Damocles that fortunately never fell. But the oil industry secret climate change predictions are becoming reality, and not by accident. Fossil-fuel producers willfully drove us toward the grim future they feared by promoting their products, lying about the effects, and aggressively defending their share of the energy market. As the world warms, the building blocks of our planet – its ice sheets, forests, and atmospheric and ocean currents – are being altered beyond repair. Who has the right to foresee such damage and then choose to fulfill the prophecy? Although war planners and fossil-fuel companies had the arrogance to decide what level of devastation was appropriate for humanity, only Big Oil had the temerity to follow through. That, of course, is one time too many. Benjamin Franta, a former research fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, is a doctoral candidate at Stanford University, where his research focuses on the history of climate science and politics.

15,"Autumn colour is perhaps the most striking of nature seasonal displays, but the vividness of the annual spectacle is largely dependent on good environmental conditions. This year, following a fine summer and with an Indian summer predicted, we look to be on course for a dazzling display that could trump recent years and extend well into November. Shorter daylight hours and colder nights are what trigger leaf drop – or senescence – but frost, like rain, can damage leaves and cause early leaf fall. Plenty of sunshine is needed to encourage concentrations of colour pigments which help to intensify leaf colour. cold spring and hot summer will have helped ready the leaves for a beautiful autumn display, but it also hinges on what the weather does now. If it cools and we get cold nights, that will contribute to good leaf colour. Autumn bulbs have also had a good baking in the sun and are giving a fine display this year. The cold spring also held back flowering which means fruit has set, so many hedges are looking colourful with berries. The long hot summer has also resulted in a “fake fall”, where plants such as elderberries yellow and drop because of extreme summer stress. But we’re unlikely to see a real flurry of colour before mid to late October, although the impact of climate change means it has happened later in recent years. The process of plants transitioning into shades of reds, yellows and oranges is hotly anticipated by gardeners and dedicated “leaf peepers” around the world. It said to be worth a staggering to the US state of Wisconsin alone. It might seem counterintuitive that while we prepare to reacquaint with jumpers, gloves and woolly hats, trees are preparing to shed this year leaves, something known as leaf senescence. Here why. Leaf senescence is an “altruistic death” allowing the degradation and redistribution of nutrients produced during growth back to other parts of the plant. This strategy evolved to maximise the fitness and survival of the plant. Leaf senescence is highly complex, involving multiple genes and numerous biological, chemical and physical processes. And at the heart of it all is a pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is what gives leaves their green colour, absorbing and reflecting different hues from the colour light spectrum, as seen in a rainbow. In leaves it absorbs mainly red and blue light, reflecting green, and it is this reflection that makes leaves appear green to the human eye. But as well as providing a lustrous green sheen, chlorophyll is also an essential component of photosynthesis, which is arguably the single most important chemical process on our planet. Using energy from sunlight, chlorophyll strips electrons from water molecules, which then convert carbon dioxide into carbon compounds and produce oxygen, which is essential for life on earth. In autumn, chlorophyll, mainly in deciduous plants, is slowly broken down and reabsorbed by the plant, diminishing the green colour of the leaves. It is this reabsorption that ensures they spring back to life the following year. As chlorophyll is broken down, pigments called carotenoids and flavonoids are revealed and it is these, again, through the absorption and reflection of different colours from the light spectrum, that are responsible for the yellow and orange hues of leaves. Sugar concentration in the leaves also increases anthocyanin production, which causes some leaves to turn a shade of red. Sweet gum and acers can almost always be relied upon for good colour but some trees, including alders, show little change. What tends to make the difference in gardens is the reaction of our more proliferate native trees, such as oak, and whether they take on stronger yellows or more placid browns. Back on ground level, late flowering bulbs like nerines and crocus are also giving a bold display having benefitted from a good baking this summer. Although autumn colour is largely beyond the control of gardeners, you can increase the probability of good results by maintaining healthy plants and buying cultivars well known for their hues and all-important pigments.

16,"hen the Batemans marine park, not far from my home on the New South Wales south coast, was first created, fishing on a beach next to my property was illegal. Then, under immense pressure from recreational fishers, the zoning throughout the marine park was changed. A few hundred metres offshore stayed a no-take zone but line fishing and spearfishing is now allowed from my local beach. One of my greatest pleasures is to head down to the water with my children and cast into the breakers at dusk, hoping to catch my dinner. The rezoning along the Batemans coast meant substantial areas remained off limits to recreational anglers like me. But there are still more than enough spots to fish throughout the marine park. The tourists still come and everyone who wants to catch a fish can. I would be a lying hypocrite if I said I wasn’t glad that, in my backyard, fishing was still allowed. But I would also be lying if I said I didn’t believe that more of the coastline next to my property should be given full protection. The 'best' outcome? How the marine park plans divided scientists and conservationists This is the problem with Monday announcement by the NSW primary industries minister, Niall Blair, that there will be no fishing lockouts in the proposed Sydney marine park. In a statement, the minister said lockouts were taken off the table after the NSW Marine Estate Management Authority identified areas that require better management to ensure their sustainability. “What is now clear is that their proposed management methods, and in some cases the sizes of the sites, offered up a narrow option that unfairly impacted on low risk activities, such as fishing and spearfishing,” Blair said. It easy to understand why a government facing an electoral wipe-out in the March state elections might decide discretion is the better part of valour when it comes to opening a fight with the fishing and shooting fraternity and the city screeching radio shock jocks. But scientists and conservationists have been appalled at the timing of the announcement. Blair decision is a predictable crumbling after the extremely poor political judgment of picking this fight at this time of an electoral cycle. More importantly, all the decision does is perpetuate the idea that regional Australians have to put up with the sharpest end of government conservation measures while a marine park in Sydney, and the anglers who use it, will be spared from having to make any sacrifices. It widens the divide between city and country – one of this government main problems. Either that or it will ultimately result in the removal of no-take zones from areas like the Batemans marine park – a devastating wind back of environmental gains after decades of hard-won marine parks. There has been years of grumbling from coastal regional communities that they have had to learn to live with marine parks while Sydneysiders have continued to largely be allowed to fish where they please. A UTS professor of marine ecology, David Booth, who described Blair announcement as a “gutless tragedy” says: “The Sydney region is the last part of the NSW coast that does not have a marine park, even though Sydney harbour has extraordinary biodiversity, with more fish species recorded here than in the whole of the British Isles. “About species of fish call Sydney home, one-quarter are visitors from the north, the rest of southern origin, but this is shifting under climate change, which will drive key southern fisheries species from our region.” There has been more evidence recently that no-take zones will be critical for the survival of ocean ecosystems, Booth says. The draft Sydney marine park plan would have delivered the highest level of protection from fishing to only of the Sydney coast. Labor and Greens keep up the fight against Coalition marine park plans “That means of the waters between Newcastle and Wollongong would still be open to fishing,” Booth says. It is devastating for researchers like him, who know the waters off Sydney better than almost anyone, that this pitifully modest collection of comparatively small no-take zones will now be abandoned. The government faces a lose-lose scenario where, not only won’t it get the much needed fully protected areas in the Sydney marine park, it now has opened the prospect of regional communities like mine, demanding they get the same treatment as city anglers – a fishing free-for-all. Having abandoned a science-based decision making process in the face of an angry mob, it seems clear that all rural fishers now have to do is show they too are mad enough and their marine parks will also be gutted. As much as I love fishing, I hope this doesn’t happen. I would be prepared to forgo my right to fish for my children right to have a healthy marine ecosystem. &nbsp;James Woodford is the author of seven books including the Great White Shark and the Great Barrier Reef.

17,"Last week, California Governor Jerry Brown signed State Senator and US Senate candidate Kevin de León SB which mandates that the state obtain all of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by . That in itself was a big deal, but Brown didn’t stop there; he also issued an executive order calling for the entire California economy to become carbon-neutral by That a huge deal. In order to stay below the Paris climate threshold of global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, humanity must become carbon-neutral by around or . If California can meet Brown target, it will be providing the rest of the world a blueprint for meeting the Paris target. As the world fifth-largest economy, California can provide a powerful roadmap for others to follow. Brown executive order directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to work with relevant state agencies to develop a framework for implementation and accounting of progress toward statewide carbon neutrality. While state agencies can figure out a plan to achieve carbon neutrality, the state legislature will have to pass laws to implement that plan. California has been all-in on tackling climate change, as its carbon cap and trade system and SB illustrate, but Californians will have to keep electing climate realists to state office in order to make the dream of carbon neutrality a reality. Carbon-free electricity is just a start SB tackles the electricity sector, but because California has long been transitioning toward clean energy, electricity now only accounts for of the state greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the biggest chunk at . Brown has been pushing for a transition to electric cars, signing another executive order earlier this year setting a goal of EVs on the road by and several bills last week to help expand their use . While California has the most EVs on the road today (both total and per capita) of any state, they still only account for of new car sales, with sold so far. Accelerating that transition toward EVs is crucial for meeting the carbon neutrality goal, and it the main reason why California is fighting the Trump administration efforts to freeze fuel efficiency standards and take away the state ability to set its own. The industrial sector accounts for another of California greenhouse gas emissions. About half of that comes from the petroleum industry – predominantly from drilling for oil and natural gas, as well as oil refining. California is the fourth-largest oil producing state . The Trump administration wants to increase that number and is contemplating opening million acres in California held by the Bureau of Land Management to fracking and oil drilling. But a wiser future president could revoke those drilling leases on federal lands, and California could ban drilling and fracking on state lands. That a bridge too far for Jerry Brown, and protesters have been criticizing him for it , but it easy to imagine a future governor taking this step. Agriculture and forestry account for another of California greenhouse gas emissions. The state is already launching a Healthy Soils Initiative to increase carbon sequestration via farming. For example, one pilot project is monitoring how much carbon will be stored by clover planted between trees at an almond orchard. The University of California at Davis is also conducting experiments to evaluate how changing livestock feed can reduce methane emissions from cattle. Another comes from the residential sector, most of which is due to burning natural gas for heating and cooking. But stoves, hot water heaters, and heating units can be replaced by electric appliances powered by California increasingly carbon-free energy. Last week, Brown also signed a bill directing CARB to study ways of cutting carbon pollution from residential and commercial buildings. In short, there are a lot of feasible ways that California can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and approach carbon neutrality. The plan will may also include some degree of carbon offsetting and carbon capture and sequestration to get the state emissions down to (or below) zero by It a daunting but achievable goal. A stark contrast to the backward-looking Trump EPA In contrast, the Trump administration has been doing everything in its power to increase carbon pollution for the sake of industry profits. In its latest polluting move, the Trump EPA plans to scrap two regulations aimed at reducing methane pollution from oil and gas wells. According to EPA own analysis , repealing a regulation requiring that oil and gas wells be monitored for methane leaks every six months will add million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent to the atmosphere over a six-year period. It will save the oil and gas industry, whose annual profits exceed per year. That the equivalent carbon pollution of adding more than cars on the road in order to give the oil &amp; gas industry a revenue boost. It hard to imagine a starker contrast. The Trump administration is making America the stupidest country in the world on climate change , while the Democrats running California are creating a roadmap to show the world how to meet the Paris climate target. And the GOP is running away from California and toward Trump.",857,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/17/california-plans-to-show-the-world-how-to-meet-the-paris-climate-target
18,"Trapped in a cage and shot at close range, the badger takes almost a minute to die. Covert footage published online by the Observer , the first to be shared publicly, shows the main method of dispatching Britain largest indigenous carnivore as part of a controversial cull now being expanded by the environment secretary, Michael Gove , which farmers insist is vital to curb the spread of TB in cattle. Taken in Cumbria by the Hunt Investigation Team, it has been released by animal rights groups for maximum political effect ahead of the Conservative party conference, as Gove considers a key report on the government TB eradication strategy. Animal rights activists said the footage raised questions about how the cull works. “The brutal slaughter of tens of thousands of badgers in the biggest destruction of a protected species in living memory is a national disgrace,” said Dominic Dyer, CEO of the Badger Trust. “This war on wildlife has been carried out in secrecy by poorly paid contractors with no independent monitoring or concern for animal welfare or public safety. The film footage that has emerged from Cumbria is the first time we have seen evidence of cull contractors at work. It clearly shows a badger taking over seconds to die after being shot in a cage, and contractors removing it from the site without bagging and sealing the carcass in line with government TB biosecurity guidelines.” The trust estimates that the government may have licensed the killing of more than badgers by the end of the year, at a cost of tens of millions of pounds. It claims that once all the Whitehall administration, equipment, storage, training, monitoring, policing and legal costs are taken into account, the cost of cage trapping and shooting a badger is more than per animal. In comparison, the cost of cage trapping, vaccinating and releasing a badger is less than per animal, the trust says. The Zoological Society of London has also come out against the cull . It says that while badgers can and do transmit TB to cattle, most herds acquire the disease from other cattle. It also argues that culling increases TB transmission within badger populations and spreads the disease to new areas, and backs the trust argument that badger vaccination is a much more promising tool for TB eradication. But the government claims reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB have been recorded in Gloucestershire and Somerset following the completion of licensed four-year badger culls. It published data earlier this month – disputed by some animal rights groups – which it says shows that in the Gloucestershire cull area, TB incidence has fallen from before culling started to in year four of the cull, while in Somerset it has reduced from to A spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union said a cull was crucial: “More than cattle were slaughtered last year in England because of this devastating disease and more than farms that had previously been clear of the disease were affected by it. The NFU has always supported a comprehensive and proportionate eradication strategy, which balances disease-control measures with business sustainability. “We must have every option available to us to tackle TB – including cattle testing, cattle movement restrictions, biosecurity advice, vaccination and control of the disease in wildlife.” The government chief vet has said that taking action to prevent TB infection of cattle by badger populations is an essential part of the government strategy to eradicate the disease in England, and that badger control is currently the best option available. Of the badgers killed to date, about have been tested for TB and less than have been found to have the disease. Gove recently approved new badger cull licences in England in bringing the total in operation to A review of the government bovine TB strategy carried out by Sir Charles Godfray, a population biologist and fellow of the Royal Society, was delivered to Gove last week and will be published shortly. A spokesman for the Hunt Investigation Team defended its decision to use covert video surveillance. “Our team have been active protecting badgers in multiple cull zones. In areas we could not actively defend, we placed hidden cameras in order to evidence malpractice and cruelty associated with the cull. Badgers are paying the price for a disease in cattle that is caused by human mismanagement.”",727,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/30/covert-footage-reveals-cruelty-of-badger-culls
19,"If George Monbiot really wants to get people talking about the connection between climate change and the economy, he’d do better to find a different question to “how do we stop growth?” ( While growth continues we’ll never kick our fossil fuel habit , September). The elephant in the room is the assumption that nature resources and capabilities are so large that they can be considered infinite and so excluded from the economic cost of production. This has the unintended consequence of rewarding destruction. Hence the German situation in Hambacher: the lignite has value because it can be sold to be burned, the forest has none unless the trees are cut down for economic use. And, in an infinite world, there are always more forests. This form of thinking might have been a useful simplification when human population and activities were at the levels of the Enlightenment, when much of the philosophy that still drives the economy was developed. Indeed, for any one individual the world is still a remarkably big place and it is difficult to imagine it running out of anything. But a resource that would have supplied an Enlightenment-sized population for years would last today just years. And that is without considering increased rates of consumption. Maybe the better question is: how do we rewrite the rules of our economy to reward activities that nourish our future rather than those that destroy it? Harold Forbes Wareham, Dorset With reference to George Monbiot article and Sébastien Thibault brilliant illustration may I make two suggestions: first, that cycling in the UK is made much more user-friendly – at present only the most intrepid would dare to cycle on our roads, whereas in Holland cycling is an option for all ages, shapes and sizes, not just Lycra-clad athletes; second, when resources are scarce, it makes sense to introduce a fair system of rationing. I remember the rationing of food, clothing and fuel in the It was tiresome but necessary and it ensured that no one in UK starved. Rather than destroy our environment, we need to introduce a system of mileage rationing for people using modes of transport which run, directly or indirectly, on fossil fuels. I don’t believe it is a basic human right to be able to jet here, there and everywhere with no restrictions. Jill Greer Chadlington, Oxfordshire George Monbiot is right. It takes a peculiar form of obstinacy for news channels such as the BBC to consistently not mention climate change. Last week, for example, Jeremy Corbyn committed the Labour party to a huge investment in green technology coupled, to zero carbon emissions by This was ignored in favour of yet more pointless debates about Brexit. Future generations will look back on the present era with a profound sense of disbelief that the Kardashians command times more airtime than climate change does; and that the media obsession with Brexit resembles a pack of vultures fighting over a dead carcass from which every item of interest has long since been stripped bare. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Chair, Help Rescue the Planet George Monbiot is right (again). But is there any chance he could get together with, say, Owen Jones, Caroline Lucas and Justin Welby, to tell us how, practically, to get from where we are to where we should be, without catastrophic unemployment, poverty and civil unrest? Philip Hall Cotford St Luke, Somerset Re climate change, “be the change you wish to see in the world”. Stop driving fossil-fuel cars. Become vegetarian. Consume less. Use less energy. Do not follow fashion. Do not upgrade phones with every new model. Buy products, including clothes, furniture and household items to last. Recycle everything: plastic, glass, metal and organic matter. Take furniture, clothes, DVDs, CDs and everything else that is still usable to charity shops. Neil Sinclair Edinburgh George Monbiot considers the mismatch, between economic growth and environmental sustainability, on a global scale. At an individual level, we all need to forget what everyone else might be doing, and tailor our activities and consumption to much reduced totals. This has to mean a much simplified lifestyle: being happy with our personal relationships, reducing most forms of competition, and devoting our time to caring for other members of society. It means a fundamental change of attitude to everyone else. At a political level, we need to replace competitive politics with cooperative politics. Left and right politics is redundant, as are most of our politicians. As Larry Elliott once said in a related context, “ best of luck with that ”. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire George Monbiot is of course quite right. But why will he not take his argument to its logical conclusion? There is one overarching problem which is behind all the others: it subsumes global warming, pollution, the ozone hole, shortages of basic ingredients. It is the population problem: quite simply, there are too many of us. Someone, I forget who, has suggested that if everyone on earth had a European standard of living we would need about three planets to sustain us (five for a North American standard). Some people get very exercised over the thought that there might be or even billion of us by That is the wrong concern: they (and we) should worry about the billion we have now. I believe that it is not enough to slow or stop population growth; we need to reverse it – drastically, and fast – but this obviously raises some unpleasant decisions.

22,"Backers of mini nuclear power stations have asked for billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to build their first UK projects, according to an official document. Advocates for small modular reactors (SMRs) argue they are more affordable and less risky than conventional large-scale nuclear plants, and therefore able to compete with the falling costs of windfarms and solar power. But the nuclear industry claims that the mini plants would be a cheap option for producing low-carbon power appear to be undermined by the significant sums it has been asking of ministers. Some firms have been calling for as much as to fund construction costs, according to a government-commissioned report, released under freedom of information rules. Companies also wanted up to of public money to help steer their reactor designs through the regulatory approval process, which is a cost usually paid by nuclear companies. Ten companies hoping to build the plants requested direct government funding, according to the briefing paper by the Expert Finance Working Group on Small Reactors . While the report named the companies involved in the mini nuclear projects, it did not specify who was asking for financial support. David Lowry , a nuclear policy consultant who obtained the document, said: “SMRs are either old, discredited designs repackaged when companies see governments prepared to throw taxpayers’ subsidies to support them, or are exotic new technologies, with decades of research needed before they reach commercial maturity.” The working group that drafted the report, and was appointed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), urged the government in August to put in place a framework to help bring the smaller plants to market. The government has already offered of funding for research and development of one group of SMRs, which typically have a capacity of less than a tenth of the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant being built in Somerset, or enough power for homes. Mini nuclear power stations are unlikely to supply clean energy to Britain homes and businesses any time soon. Of more than British, US and Chinese companies that have expressed an interest in building one in the UK, the majority told the working group that their power stations would be ready to deployed in the The companies include UK firms such as Rolls-Royce, Sheffield Forgemasters and Atkins, along with China CNNC, US companies NuScale and Westinghouse, and France EDF Energy . The working group found the firms’ cost estimates “varied significantly”, to the degree that some of the companies clearly had a “lack of understanding” of how British nuclear regulation works. It also noted that some of the companies proposed using “non-standard fuels” rather than the conventional uranium used by today nuclear plants, which “may add cost to business models” because of new facilities to produce and later manage the spent fuel. The firms told the group that the four main barriers they faced were finding and confirming sites, the cost of regulatory approval for their designs, a lack of state funding and unclear policy. The government is expected to make announcements soon regarding the siting regime and regulatory approvals for SMRs, sources told the Guardian. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the reactors could “provide flexible, reliable nuclear power to complement other low-carbon sources of generating electricity … [and] a potential export opportunity”. A spokesperson for the UK SMR consortium, which includes Rolls- Royce, said: “One of the compelling elements of our consortium power station is that, after the design is fully developed and licensed, no government funding is required to construct or operate it.”",598,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/30/energy-firms-demand-billions-from-uk-taxpayer-for-mini-reactors
23,"For David Smith, the final straw came as he was standing at the bus stop near his home in south London with his two-year-old son Ely. He had become increasingly aware of the damage pollution was doing to young people health since the birth of his two youngest children. And when the gridlocked traffic edged forward and a lorry pulled up a metre from Ely, something snapped. “I realised this was simply not right,” said Smith, “On a very basic level I was knowingly poisoning my two-year-old son and I had to do something about it.” The two, who had been on their regular trip to the local skate park, turned round and headed back to the family first-floor flat overlooking a dual carriageway in Wandsworth. From there, Smith has fought a year-long campaign to raise awareness of air pollution in his area that has seen him start petitions , launch a blog and meet local politicians. “I have put my energy into trying to deal with the problem because, if I didn’t, I think I would be overwhelmed with a real sense of helplessness,” he said. The scale of the UK air pollution crisis has become more evident over recent months – especially its impact on children. Reports have emphasised the links between illegally poisonous air and heart disease , dementia , reduced cognitive ability and asthma deaths . Some local politicians are starting to appreciate the threat , but the government, which has lost three court cases over its perceived lack of action on air pollution, has been widely criticised. Smith said that he first became concerned about the air pollution crisis after his two youngest children – a daughter, months, and Ely, now three – were born prematurely and “on the cusp” of being underweight. His daughter has since suffered serious respiratory problems, and now has medication and medical equipment to help her breathe. Sitting at his kitchen table, Smith says his wife, a lawyer in central London, travelled to work as usual during both pregnancies, walking along a busy road to the tube. “You can’t attribute these things definitively to air pollution but the more you find out the more you realise the huge damage it is doing to our children health,” he said. The family, who do not own a car, now carefully plan every journey. They avoid main roads, the rush hour and busy bus stops wherever possible. But it is not easy. “There is only so much you can do when in a big city like this. To a certain extent, we have got to accept now that we are doing great damage to our children long-term health simply by living here.” The family lives on a section of the just before it joins the South Circular – two of the busiest roads in London. Every morning, queues of traffic form outside their home. Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old who died in after a series of respiratory problems, also lived close to the South Circular. Her mother, Rosamund, has fought to highlight the role she believes pollution played in Ella death. For Smith, Ella case provides a warning. “That could happen to any child who regularly travels on – and attends school on – a busy road. That hundreds of thousands of children in London alone, and yet so little is being done to protect them.” Smith is campaigning for exclusion zones around bus stops. Next month he is meeting officials from Transport for London to put forward proposals for a new traffic management system and a change to driving behaviour on the dual carriageway outside his house, which he calculates would lead to a huge reduction in pollution.But he says that there also needs to be a fundamental change in the way people think about air pollution: “People are not focusing on children health when they are thinking about air pollution, because if they were they would be doing something about it. If I can recognise that, I don’t see why politicians and policy makers can’t.”",673,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/30/air-pollution-london-poison-campaigner
24,"fter her house flooded for the third year in a row, Elizabeth Boineau was ready to flee. She packed her possessions into dozens of boxes, tried not to think of the mold and mildew-covered furniture and retreated to a second-floor condo that should be beyond the reach of pounding rains and swelling seas. Boineau is leaving behind a handsome, early house in Charleston, South Carolina, the shutters painted in the city eponymous shade of deep green. Last year, after Hurricane Irma introduced of water into a home Boineau was still patching up from the last flood, local authorities agreed this historic slice of Charleston could be torn down. “I was sloshing through the water with my puppy dog, debris was everywhere,” she said. “I feel completely sunken. It would cost me around to raise the house, demolish the first floor. I’m going to rent a place instead, on higher ground.” Millions of Americans will confront similarly hard choices as climate change conjures up brutal storms, flooding rains, receding coastlines and punishing heat. Many are already opting to shift to less perilous areas of the same city, or to havens in other states. Whole towns from Alaska to Louisiana are looking to relocate, in their entirety, to safer ground. The era of climate migration is, virtually unheralded, already upon America. The population shift gathering pace is so sprawling that it may rival anything in US history. “Including all climate impacts it isn’t too far-fetched to imagine something twice as large as the Dustbowl,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, referencing the upheaval in which million people moved from the dusty, drought-ridden plains to California. This enormous migration will probably take place over a longer period than the Dustbowl but its implications are both profound and opaque. It will plunge the US into an utterly alien reality. “It is very difficult to model human behaviour under such extreme and historically unprecedented circumstances,” Keenan admits. The closest analogue could be the Great Migration – a period spanning a large chunk of the century when about million black people departed the Jim Crow south for cities in the north, midwest and west. By the end of this century, sea level rise alone could displace million people, according to one study , including million in Florida. States including Louisiana, California, New York and New Jersey will also have to grapple with hordes of residents seeking dry ground. “There not a state unaffected by this,” said demographer Mat Hauer, lead author of the research, which is predicated on a severe sea level increase. There are established migration preferences for some places – south Florida to Georgia, New York to Colorado – but in many cases people would uproot to the closest inland city, if they have the means. “The Great Migration was out of the south into the industrialized north, whereas this is from every coastal place in the US to every other place in the US,” said Hauer. “Not everyone can afford to move, so we could end up with trapped populations that would be in a downward spiral. I have a hard time imagining what that future would be like.” Within just a few decades, hundreds of thousands of homes on US coasts will be chronically flooded . By the end of the century, of sea level rise would redraw the coastline with familiar parts – such as southern Florida, chunks of North Carolina and Virginia, much of Boston, all but a sliver of New Orleans – missing. Warming temperatures will fuel monstrous hurricanes – like the devastating triumvirate of Irma, Maria and Harvey in followed by Florence this year – that will scatter survivors in jarring, uncertain ways. The projections are starting to materialize in parts of the US, forming the contours of the climate migration to come. “I don’t see the slightest evidence that anyone is seriously thinking about what to do with the future climate refugee stream,” said Orrin Pilkey, professor emeritus of coastal geology at Duke University. “It boggles the mind to see crowds of climate refugees arriving in town and looking for work and food.” Pilkey new book – Sea Level Rise Along Americas Shores: The Slow Tsunami – envisions apocalyptic scenes where millions of people, largely from south Florida, will become “a stream of refugees moving to higher ground”. “They will not be the bedraggled families carrying their few possessions on their backs as we have seen in countless photos of people fleeing wars and ethnic cleansing, most recently in Myanmar and Syria,” Pilkey states in his book. “Instead, they will be well-off Americans driving to a new life in their cars, with moving trucks behind, carrying a lifetime of memories and possessions.” Dejected with frigid New York winters, Chase Twichell and her husband purchased a four-bedroom apartment in Miami Beach in with the plan of spending at least a decade basking in the sunshine. At first, keeping a pair of flip-flops on hand to deal with the flooded streets seemed an acceptable quirk, until the magnitude of the encroaching seas became apparent when the city spent to elevate streets near Twichell abode. Twichell began to notice water pumps were spewing plastic bags, condoms and chip packets into the bay. Friends’ balconies started getting submerged. Twichell, a poet, found apocalyptic themes creeping into her work. Last year, she sold the apartment to a French businessman and moved back to upstate New York. “It was like end of the world stuff,” she said. “It was crazy for us to have such a big investment in such a dangerous situation.” Her neighbours initially scolded her but now several are also selling up, fretting that the real estate and insurance markets for properties like theirs will seize up. “It was horrible but fascinating to see it,” Twichell said. “It like we got to see the future and it wasn’t pretty. It like a movie where there a terrible volcano that is destroying everything, only it much slower than that.” A sense of fatalism is also starting to grip some local officials. Philip Stoddard, mayor of South Miami, has seen a colleague, spooked by sea level rise, move to California and some neighbours sell their houses before an expected slump in prices. Stoddard and his wife regularly discuss buying a fallback property, perhaps in Washington DC. “Most people will wait for the problem to be bad to take action, that what I worry about,” he said. “We can buy a lot of time, but in the end we lose. The sea level will go over the tops of our buildings.” Sanitation is an immediate preoccupation for Stoddard, given the large proportion of residents who aren’t served by sewage works. “If you’re using a septic tank and your toilet starts to overflow into your bathroom because of water inundation, that a basis-of-civilization problem,” he said. “A medieval city wasn’t a nice smelling place and they had a lot of diseases.” Those living near the coasts will face pressures of the gradual (sea level rise) as well as dramatic (storms) nature but people inland will also be harried to move by climate change. Farming techniques and technology have improved immeasurably since the Dustbowl but rising temperatures are still expected to diminish yields for crops such as maize, soybeans and wheat, prompting the departure of younger people from farming. By Texas county, the largest wheat-producing county in Oklahoma, could spend an extra days a year above compared with now. A study published last year found that the economies of the southern states, along with parts of the west, will suffer disproportionately as temperatures rise. In what researchers called potentially one of the largest transfers of wealth in US history, the poorest third of counties are expected to lose up to of their income unless greenhouse gas emissions are severely curtailed. Wealth, and potentially people, are expected to shift north and west. Meanwhile, cities already struggling with heat will see wealthy residents head for cooler climes. Last year, people died in Phoenix due to a particularly fierce summer. Increasing heat will start testing the durability of the populace, even those shielded by air conditioning. In the western states, wildfires are getting larger, razing homes in ever more spectacular ways and choking thousands of people with carcinogenic smoke . Further to the south, at the border, there are suggestions that people from Central America are being nudged towards the US because of drought and hurricanes in their homelands, part of a trend that will see as many as million climate refugees worldwide by “People will get very grumpy and upset with very hot temperatures,” said Amir Jina, an environmental economist at the University of Chicago who co-authored the research on economic losses. “Even if you have air conditioning, some areas start to look less habitable. By the middle of the century parts of the south-west and south-east won’t look attractive to live in. “That insidious climate migration is the one we should worry about. The big disasters such as hurricanes will be obvious. It the pressures we don’t know or understand that will reshape population in the century.” Prodded to name refuges in the US, researchers will point to Washington and Oregon in the Pacific north-west, where temperatures will remain bearable and disasters unlikely to strike. Areas close to the Great Lakes and in New England are also expected to prove increasingly attractive to those looking to move. By southern states are expected to lose of their US population share, while the north-east will increase by A recent study forecast that the population in the western half of the US will increase by more than over the next years due to climate migration, largely from the south and midwest. But these population shifts are uncertain and are bound by a tangle of other factors and caveats. People will still largely follow paths guided by nearby family or suitable jobs. Even those who do want to move may find favoured locations too expensive. Some will just grimly hang on. “With property rights as strong as they are in the US, some people may choose to go down with the ship,” said Harvard Keenan. “The question is whether they have the means and the options to do anything else.” “People can usually cope with being a little less comfortable, but if you see repeated storms or severe damage to crops, that will trigger change,” said Solomon Hsiang, who researches how climate change will affect society at the University of California. “There will be pressure to move a little north. It won’t be everyone, though, it won’t be like the great migration of wildebeest in Africa. Whole cities picking up and moving would be hugely expensive.” Smaller towns are giving relocation a go, however. In the community of Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana was the first place to be given federal money to replant itself. The population, situated on an island being eaten away by the sea, is looking to move to a former sugar cane farm miles inland. “We are called climate refugees but I hate that term,” said Chantal Comardelle, who grew up in the Isle de Jean Charles community. “We will be the first ones to face this in the modern US but we won’t be the last. It important for us to get it right so other communities know that they can do it, too.” About a dozen coastal towns in Alaska are also looking to relocate, as diminishing sea ice exposes them to storms and rising temperatures thaw the very ground beneath them. One, Newtok, has identified a new site and has some federal funding to begin uprooting itself. A buyout of damaged and at-risk homes has already occurred in New York City Staten Island in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, while certain flood-prone houses in Houston, pummeled by Hurricane Harvey last year, are also being purchased and razed. But the cost of doing this for all at-risk Americans would be eye-watering. Estimates range from to per person to undertake a relocation. If million people do have to move, it seems fantastical to imagine or even a significant fraction of this amount, being spent by governments to ease the way. “As a country we aren’t set up to deal with slow-moving disasters like this, so people around the country are on their own,” said Joel Clement, a former Department of the Interior official who worked on the relocation of Alaskan towns. “In the Arctic I’m concerned we’ve left it too late. Younger people have left because they know the places are doomed. These towns won’t be relocated within five years and I’m sure there will be a catastrophic storm up there. My hope is no lives will be lost.” Ultimately, the US will have to choose what it wants to defend and hope its ingenuity outstrips the environmental changes ranged against it. Not everyone will be able to shelter behind fortifications like the ‘ big U ’ planned to defend lower Manhattan. Wrenching decisions will have to be made as to what and where will be sacrificed. “We won’t see whole areas abandoned but neighborhoods will get sparse and wild looking, the tax base will start to crumble,” said Stoddard, mayor of South Miami. “We don’t have the laws to deal with that sort of piecemeal retreat. It magical thinking to think someone else will buy out your property. “We need a plan as to what will be defended because at the moment the approach is that some kid in a garage will come with a solution. There isn’t going to be a mop and bucket big enough for this problem.” Americans: the next climate migrants features",2287,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/americas-era-of-climate-mass-migration-is-here
25,"Scientists have discovered three new species of “hardcore” fish living in one of the deepest parts of the ocean, the see-through, scale-free creatures perfectly adapted to conditions that would instantly kill most life on Earth. An international team of researchers used state-of-the-art underwater cameras to find the new fish at the bottom of the Atacama trench in the eastern Pacific ocean at a depth of metres feet) – and were surprised at their abundance in such an inhospitable environment. First known omnivorous shark species identified “These things are right on the limit of what all fish can take so you might expect at that depth you’d maybe be lucky to see one or two eking out an existence,” Alan Jamieson, senior lecturer in marine ecology at Newcastle University told AFP on Friday. “But there a whole heap of them sitting there.” Temporarily named the pink, blue and purple Atacama snailfish, the previously unknown creatures are inches) long, translucent and have no scales. They appear to be uniquely adapted to conditions four-and-a-half miles beneath the ocean surface, where the days are permanently pitch black and water temperatures barely top At such depths, the pressure is so great that larger animals would be crushed under their own mass. “It the equivalent of having an weight placed on your little finger,” Jamieson said. Researchers believe the fish may have evolved to live on the sea floor to avoid larger prey. “The hardest structures in their bodies are the bones in their inner ear, which give them balance, and their teeth,” said Thomas Linley, a Newcastle research associate who went on the expedition. In fact, being made almost entirely of a gel-like substance, the fish would die without the crushing pressure holding them together. “Their bodies are extremely fragile and melt rapidly when brought to the surface,” Linley said. The Atacama trench runs almost along the west coast of South America and bottoms out at metres. Jamieson said the team discovery should give hope to researchers working to uncover new species in some of the least-explored corners of our planet. “The finding of new species is not limited to small stuff in the mud or tiny jellyfish, here there are three species of fish about long,” he said. The week in wildlife – in pictures “The Atacama trench is the same size as the Andes mountain range. If we can put a camera down and pick out three new species within a matter of days ... these things are not rare – they are just out of reach.” With more than known varieties of snailfish, Jamieson said it has adapted to a wide variety of conditions, some extremely tough to survive in. “Most of them live at shallow levels – we even get them up the Tyne river in Newcastle. They’re an amazing family that has sort of evolved to fit every niche, every corner of the planet,” he said. He nevertheless admitted to being impressed with the newly discovered varieties and their ability to thrive in some of the harshest environments on Earth. “The water temperatures in these trenches are always less than – that in itself is pretty hardcore, let alone slamming pressure on it and hardly any food,” he said.",539,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/15/gel-like-see-through-fish-discovered-75km-down-on-pacific-ocean-floor
26,"rant Hazlehurst, a civil servant from Bromley, Kent has seen many whales. “Fin, sperm, Cuvier beaked, True beaked, sei, long-fin pilot …” most of them from his regular jaunts on a car ferry in the Bay of Biscay. “But I never thought I would see a beluga, not in the Thames,” he said. “So, I’m hoping.” So were the two dozen or so others who, on Friday morning, gathered on a windy shore near Gravesend, scanning foam-flecked waves in anticipation that, for a fourth day, the beluga whale that has somehow got lost in the Thames , would show itself. Two hours in and Bill, who had travelled from Somerset, had only managed to tick off a sparrowhawk. He had heard about the beluga on a birding app. “But I didn’t believe it. I was waiting for it to come up: ‘Correction. Albino porpoise,’” he said. Now he was here, and – ping – his alert went off: “Whale spotted, just west of the Ship and Lobster pub.” It was a couple of kilometres away. He was off at a trot. “I’m a happy man,” he said later, after managing to see it. Peter Cartwright, was one of the first to spot it on Friday. “First you see this big melon head coming up, and then it rolls over. It just like a big white tyre,” said the counsellor from south-east London. He and his brother had, cunningly, split up and gone in different directions to maximise their chances. Was it exciting? “Absolutely. It a beluga,” he said. Beluga whales, which can grow up to six metres in length, are normally at home in icy Arctic waters around Svalbard, Greenland, or in the Barents Sea, so the warmer temperature of the Thames is problematic. The lonely Thames beluga whale is an anomaly – and an omen | Philip Hoare Rescue teams have been on standby since the whale was first seen on Tuesday. But the plan seems to be to monitor and wait as long as the animal appears healthy and is not showing distress. How long a wait is not an easy question, even for the experts. Though two belugas were briefly spotted off the Northumberland coast in this week sighting is the furthest ever south. It appears to have a food source, but its thick blubber is designed for the Arctic. “We’ve never had the opportunity, thankfully, to observe such a situation before, so we really don’t know how long it could remain,” said Lucy Babey, head of science and conservation at the charity Orca. First to spot the cetacean, known to ancient mariners as the “sea canary” for its distinctive clicks, squawks and whistles, was ecologist Dave Andrews, working on a bird survey in the area on Tuesday. A white shape caught his eye but he wasn’t sure if it was just a wave. “About one hour later, I heard the whoosh sound of a blow of a whale,” he said, “and it was just out in front of me. I was quite shocked. I had seen them before in the Arctic so I knew. But I couldn’t quite believe I was seeing it there in the Thames.” Andrews shot video and posted to the Rare Bird Alert and to Twitter. Then, he said, “the craziness started”. Within two hours TV helicopter crews were flying overhead, and around people had descended on Gravesend, with others also on the opposite bank at Tilbury. Wildlife writer and photographer James Lowen immediately sped from his Norfolk home. “It was a once-in-a-life time sighting,” said Lowen, who has visited the Arctic but never before seen a beluga. “Failed on the Svalbard, yet succeeded on the Thames. Incredible.” “Seen with the naked eye it was was like a moon rolling through the water, but with binoculars, you could see this great melon-shaped forehead. Some people were lucky enough to see it ‘spy hopping’ which is when it pops its head above the water to look around.” Wildlife cameraman Richard Taylor-Jones, who saw the Twitter alert, was “quite incredulous”. “But there was no doubt about it. The pictures said it. It was a beluga whale. So I jumped in the car because I thought this is an opportunity I simply cannot miss.” He added: “Lots have come down from London. You hear people saying: ‘Crikey, I was supposed to be in the office today.’ “There are some very keen people and lots of smiles. It a very jovial atmosphere, because it something extraordinary.” Orca 'apocalypse': half of killer whales doomed to die from pollution On seeing the whale, he felt “excitement, and shock, and incredulity”. “But then, very quickly followed by a degree of sadness, because I just can’t see this story ending well. I hope, of course, that it going to make its way back out to sea. But it just shouldn’t be here,” he said. The whale has been spotted taking deep breaths and diving, as though feeding, and swimming vigorously against the tide. Volunteers from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue have inspected it at close quarters from a boat, and believe it appears healthy. The Port of London Authority is protecting the whale by warning boats to avoid the area, and urging the public to admire it from the shore and not approach in boats, or fly drones or TV helicopters over it. One fear is it may swim further up the Thames towards London. Martin Garside, a spokesman from the Port of London Authority, said it had remained in roughly the same spot since Tuesday. While it was a marvellous spectacle, he maintained: “The best thing for this whale is that it is never seen again.” The hopes are it will find its own way back out to sea. Something has gone wrong with its sophisticated sonar navigation system, either through illness or through its system being confused by environmental factors, including, possibly, shipping traffic or the construction of platforms, experts believe. Said Babey: “It a little bit sad to see it, mixed still with that excitement that there is a beluga in our waters. But the overriding concern is it is thousands of miles away from its normal home. So, it does raise the questions why it here, and will it be OK.” While it remains here, however, the whale continues to draw spectators. Brian Philpot, and his wife, Maureen, set up camp on Friday at sheltered from the wind by a bush, having travelled from Dunstable, Bedfordshire. “We are really hoping to see it,” said Brian, an electrician and self-confessed “twitcher”. But, he conceded, it probably would not compete with the black-browed albatross he once spotted off Scotland.",1112,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/beluga-fever-is-tinged-with-sorrow-for-whale-watchers-on-thames
27,"Three environmental activists are believed to be the first people to receive jail sentences for an anti-fracking protest in the UK. Simon Roscoe Blevins, and Richard Roberts, were given months in prison and Richard Loizou, got months on Wednesday after being convicted of causing a public nuisance by a jury at Preston crown court in August. Another defendant, Julian Brock, was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to the same offence. The four men were charged after taking part in a four-day direct action protest that blocked a convoy of trucks carrying drilling equipment from entering the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool. A barrister for one of the men told Preston crown court that they would become the first environmental activists to receive jail sentences for staging a protest in the UK since the mass trespass on Kinder Scout in the Peak District in which marked the beginning of the right-to-roam movement. Activists have previously been given jail sentences for charges related to their protests, like breaking injunctions and contempt of court. At approximately on Tuesday July as seven lorries containing drilling equipment attempted to approach the site, Roberts, a piano restorer from London, got through a police cordon and climbed on top of the first lorry, bringing the convoy to a standstill. Loizou, a teacher from Devon, climbed on to the cab of the last lorry. At about Blevins, a soil scientist from Sheffield, also climbed on to one of the lorries. In the early hours of the following morning, Brock, from Torquay, also climbed on to a lorry in the convoy. Fellow protesters threw blankets, food and water up to the men as they camped out on the vehicles. Loizou came down on July at after hours. Blevins did the same at on July, having spent just over hours on his lorry. Roberts descended at the same day, after hours. Brock did not climb down from his lorry until July at after an estimated hours. The site near Preston New Road has been a focal point for protests since the government overturned a decision by Lancashire county council and gave the energy firm Cuadrilla consent to extract shale gas at two wells on the site in October More than protesters have been arrested since Cuadrilla began constructing a fracking pad at the site in January The company has said fracking is likely to start within the next few weeks, confirming on Monday that lorries had brought fracking equipment to the site. Sentencing the men, the judge, Robert Altham, said he thought the three men posed a risk of reoffending and could not be rehabilitated as “each of them remains motivated by an unswerving confidence that they are right”. He added: “Even at their trial they felt justified by their actions. Given the disruption caused in this case, only immediate custody can achieve sufficient punishment.” He said that while the defendants were motivated by a serious concern for the environment, they saw the public as “necessary and justified collateral damage”. Members of the men families sitting in the public gallery burst into tears when the verdicts were read out. They sang a song described as a “native tribal song of power” and blew kisses to them as they were led out of the dock. Speaking for the prosecution, Craig MacGregor said the police argued that the demonstration resulted in significant travel disruption, causing the road to be closed initially until a contraflow was established. Police said local residents had had their lives disrupted and local businesses suffered a loss of trade. MacGregor said lorry drivers were told to stay with their cabs and were unable to return home. He said the protest had cost the police and Cuadrilla approximately Two directors quit key fracking firm amid 'Tory rebellion' claims Kirsty Brimelow QC, the head of the international human rights team at Doughty St Chambers, representing Roberts on a pro-bono basis, told the judge it had been a peaceful and political protest. She said the right to freedom of speech went beyond “simply standing and shouting” and extended to non-violent direct action. Brimelow said the fact that central government had overturned the local council to reject Cuadrilla fracking application demonstrated that “political process has been exhausted”. She added that “there has been no environmental protester sentenced to jail since “It is relevant that there is a huge amount of scientific study that points to the damage of increasing climate emissions,” she said, referencing intergovernmental climate panel findings that climate change would displace million people by and lead to the extinction of one in four species by Speaking outside the courts after the sentencing, Blevins’ mother, Rosalind Blevins, said: “We are all absolutely devastated by the sentences they have received. My son, like the others, was protesting against fracking because of his deep concern about climate change, which would more appropriately be called climate chaos … I am proud of him and of them for standing up for what is so, so important for all of us.”",839,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/anti-fracking-activists-jailed-for-blackpool-cuadrilla-protest
28,"Australia greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, fuelled by the expansion in gas exports and production, according to new figures published by the Department of Environment and Energy . The government quietly published its quarterly emissions figures on Friday afternoon, a public holiday in Victoria and the day of the release of the interim royal commission report into the banking sector. The figures show that Australia policy vacuum on climate continues to drive emissions upward and further away from the country Paris targets. The data show emissions climbed in the year to March The March quarter for which the data was published recorded a increase. Emissions were up across all sectors except electricity, which fell in the year to March, and land use, which the government is continuing to record as a carbon sink. Business council faces negative ad blitz over criticism of emissions target Fugitive emissions in the energy sector rose in the year to March. The Climate Analytics director, Bill Hare, said the numbers showed Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris commitment to reduce emissions by between and by from its levels. “While emissions from the national electricity market continue to decrease due to increasing renewable electricity, Australian emissions as a whole continue to increase,” he said. “On present trends, with virtually no policies apart from the renewable energy target, which will expire in and not be replaced, emissions are set to gallop way past the Paris agreement target.” He said the figures also showed the decline in per capita emissions was beginning to flatten out “at a time when this should be accelerating”. Matt Drum, the managing director of NDEVR environmental, which tracks emissions and publishes its own quarterly reports months ahead of the government, said the absence of climate policy meant emissions were going up. “All the figures show emissions are increasing because they’ve got no policy,” he said. “What I’m really interested in is what policy is Labor going to reveal in the coming weeks? “The current government have made it very clear they’re not interested in doing anything about emissions.” The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said it was “embarrassing” that climate pollution was continuing to rise in a wealthy country like Australia. Di Natale says Greens will take hard line with a Shorten government on emissions “This latest pollution scorecard casts extreme doubt over the Morrison government claim that Australia will meet our emissions reduction targets ‘in a canter’ without strong new action. “This latest result is also flattered by falling emissions from power generation, driven by the construction of solar and wind energy under our national renewable energy target. “The Morrison government has declared it will not replace this target after meaning Australian climate pollution is at risk of growing even further.” The environment minister, Melissa Price, did not respond to questions about the increase in emissions. She said in a statement that emissions were currently below levels. The statement said the latest report on Australia national greenhouse gas inventory clearly showed the country was on track to beat its emissions target.",518,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/australias-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climb-again-amid-climate-policy-vacuum
29,"The world governments are “nowhere near on track” to meet their commitment to avoid global warming of more than above the pre-industrial period, according to an author of a key UN report that will outline the dangers of breaching this limit. A massive, immediate transformation in the way the world population generates energy, uses transportation and grows food will be required to limit the global temperature rise to and the forthcoming analysis is set to lay bare how remote this possibility is. Abandoning nuclear power plans 'would push up carbon emissions' “It extraordinarily challenging to get to the target and we are nowhere near on track to doing that,” said Drew Shindell, a Duke University climate scientist and a co-author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which will be unveiled in South Korea next month . “While it technically possible, it extremely improbable, absent a real sea change in the way we evaluate risk. We are nowhere near that.” In the Paris climate pact, international leaders agreed to curb the global temperature rise to above the era prior to mass industrialization, with an aspiration to limit this to The world has already warmed by around over the past century, fueling sea level rises, heatwaves, storms and the decline of vulnerable ecosystems such as coral reefs. Shindell would not share exact details of the IPCC report, but he said that the more ambitious goal would require a precipitous drop in greenhouse emissions triggered by a rapid phaseout of fossil fuels, particularly coal, mass deployment of solar and wind energy and the eradication of emissions from cars, trucks and airplanes. Guardian US morning briefing: sign up to stay informed Even then, emerging technology will be required on a global scale to capture emissions at the source and bury them in the ground or remove carbon directly from the air. “The penetration rate of new technology historically takes a long time,” Shindell said. “It not simple to change these things. There aren’t good examples in history of such rapid, far-reaching transitions.” The fading prospect of keeping the global temperature rise to below has provoked alarm among leaders of low-lying island nations that risk being inundated should the world warm beyond this point. “Every country must increase the ambition of their existing targets,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, which announced a plan to reach net zero emissions by at the UN general assembly in New York this week. “If we can do it, so can everyone else.” The UN general assembly has again pitted the world countries against Donald Trump when it comes to climate change, with the US president using his keynote speech to praise “clean coal”. Trump has vowed to exit the Paris accord, a stance that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told the UN should be met with consequences such as a refusal by countries to enter into trade deals with the US. “It a lot more difficult without the US as a leader in climate change negotiations,” Ola Elvestuen, Norway environment minister, told the Guardian. “We have to find solutions even though the US isn’t there.” Elvestuen said countries, including Norway, which is one of the world largest oil and gas producers, need to transition away from fossil fuels, embrace electric cars and halt deforestation. He admitted these changes had not happened quickly enough since the Paris deal. Last year, global greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly again after a short period of stasis. “We are moving way too slowly,” Elvestuen said. “We have to do more of everything, faster. We need to deliver on policies at every level. Governments normally move slowly but we don’t have the time.” “The target is difficult, but it possible. The next four to years are crucial ones, where we will set the path to how the world will develop in the decades ahead. The responsibility in doing this is impossible to overestimate. To reach the goals of the Paris agreement we need large structural changes.” While economic growth continues we’ll never kick our fossil fuels habit | George Monbiot A difference of in temperature may appear small but the IPCC report, which is a summary of leading climate science, is expected to warn there will be major impacts if warming reaches “Even is no picnic, really,” said Dr Tabea Lissner, head of adaptation and vulnerability at Climate Analytics . Lissner said a world beyond warming meant the Arctic would be ice-free in summer, around half of land-based creatures would be severely affected and deadly heatwaves would become far more common. makes quite a big difference,” she said.",768,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/global-warming-climate-change-targets-un-report
30,"Two countries have halted their funding to the UN Environment programme following sharp criticism of its leader frequent flying in a draft internal audit. The audit also said Erik Solheim, a former Norwegian environment minister, had “ no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and had claimed unjustified expenses. Now, Denmark and Sweden have frozen their funding until the audit is finalised. Concern over Solheim activities is also growing in Nairobi, where the UN Environment programme (Unep) is based, with the UN staff union there calling some of the findings in the draft audit “mind blowing”. A prominent climate scientist has also criticised Solheim globetrotting as “ obscene hypocrisy ”. Solheim spent in months and was travelling of the time, according to the audit. UN environment chief criticised by UN over frequent flying Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. On the frozen funding, first reported by Norway Aftenposten newspaper , he said it was “completely natural” for countries to wait for a final audit before releasing funds. Denmark Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it was withholding its contribution of about to Unep. “The ministry is familiar with the criticism of Solheim travel activities,” an MFA spokeswoman told the Guardian. “We take this seriously. We are now awaiting the final audit report and its possible recommendations before we pay additional funds.” Sweden International Development Agency (Sida) said they would not approve any new funding until all the issues raised had been resolved. “Sida takes all signals of misuse of funds very seriously,” a spokeswoman said. Ole Jacob Sending, from the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs thinktank said he thought the freezing of funds was probably unprecedented. “There are many who don’t think Unep is functioning as it should, and that there are other means of promoting environmental issues that can be more effective,” Sending told Aftenposten. Some observers have praised Solheim for raising the profile of Unep. A Unep spokesman said: “We do not comment on the contributions of individual member states. However, UN Environment takes great pride in its reputation as both an environmental authority and trusted steward to our donors. As always, we remain in close consultation with every member state to ensure concerns are urgently addressed and resolved.” UN staff appear increasingly unhappy with Solheim leadership, claiming it is damaging Unep. A statement on Monday issued by Martin Njuhigu, president of the UN staff union in Nairobi, said: “The Union is deeply concerned ... Some items mentioned in the report are mind blowing. They require serious attention.” Prof Kevin Anderson, a climate scientist at the University of Manchester, UK, said deep and immediate cuts in global carbon emissions are needed to tackle climate change: “Despite this, there a cohort of climate glitterati for whom climate change is less a scientific and moral imperative, and more a vehicle for their own prosperity and prestige.” The draft audit, leaked to the Guardian, was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and said Solheim extensive travel was “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction” and was a “reputation risk to the organization”. It will be finalised after responses from the individuals named. Solheim said on Friday that he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.” He said there was “excessive bureaucracy in the UN system” and that travelling was essential to his job: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world.” The Guardian can be&nbsp; contacted securely here &nbsp;or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com.",616,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/nations-halt-funding-to-un-environment-programme-as-outcry-over-chief-erik-solheim-grows
31,"America national parks have warmed twice as fast as the US average and could see some of the worst effects of climate change, according to a new study. Most of Joshua Tree national park could become uninhabitable for its eponymous trees, glaciers will continue to melt away at Glacier national park, and many other of America most treasured beauty spots could be rendered virtually unrecognizable by climate change, Patrick Gonzalez, the lead author of the study, writes in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Even the tiniest of creatures are at risk in the worst-case predictions: the American pika, a small alpine mammal, may no longer be able to survive on park land. “We are preserving the most remarkable ecosystems, and they happen to be in extreme environments,” said Gonzalez, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. Gonzalez is also the principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service but conducted and spoke about the research in his university capacity. US poised to allow more mining on land Trump removed from monuments The study finds that temperatures in national parks could go up to by under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change worst-case scenario, which shows what could happen without policies to decrease greenhouse gas pollution. With lower emissions, temperatures could still increase more than for of park land, compared to of the US as a whole, according to the study. They are particularly vulnerable because most US park land is in areas that are heating up quicker: in the mountains, the Arctic and the dry south-west. Alaska parks would see the most extreme heat increases, and the US Virgin Islands parks face less rainfall by the end of the century. In Glacier Bay national park, the Muir Glacier melted meters between and In Yellowstone national park, trees are dying because bark beetles are thriving in warmer winters. Yellowstone will also become far more vulnerable to wildfires. The area burned could be up to three to times higher by Joshua Tree national park in California could lose up to of the habitat suitable for its namesake trees. Gonzalez explained that parks at a higher elevation have a thinner atmosphere that warms faster. Higher temperatures are also melting snow cover and making the ground darker so that it absorbs more heat. Parks in California and the south-west US have seen both high temperatures and record-low rainfall, he said. The research is the first comprehensive look at climate change impacts on national parks, Gonzalez said. He said he has been using the climate impacts research to develop plans for parks to adapt and reduce the greenhouse gas pollution they contribute. The Trump administration has rescinded government efforts to slow climate change. The interior department, where the National Park Service is housed, nixed a policy that would have urged management decisions based on science, including climate change research. Park officials in New England scrubbed references to climate change and flooding risks in a report this summer, according to Reveal . The National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the study or climate change policies for parks. Our natural world is disappearing before our eyes. We have to save it | George Monbiot Jonathan Jarvis, the National Park Service director under Barack Obama who now works at UC Berkeley, said he relied on climate change projections to decide where to relocate and bolster structures in the Everglades national park in Florida, an area that has been hit by hurricanes and faces sea-level rise. Jarvis said he worries that under Trump parks won’t be able to plan long-term for climate change. “The park service manages these assets, these places, for the benefit of the American people, and they should be based on the best available sound science in the long-term public interest, not for some short-term political agenda,” Jarvis said.",644,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/us-national-parks-climate-change-impacts
32,"nly half-jokingly, some residents of a progressive city miles north of the Mexican border have adopted the “build the wall” slogan in the face of a wave of newcomers. But these perceived interlopers are starkly different from Donald Trump imagination. They are American, mainly white and are fleeing the unlivable heat. Arizona vast sweep of landscapes stretches from the scorched western movie backdrop of the Sonoran desert in the south, past rusty red sandstone outcrops further north in Sedona until you ascend to Flagstaff, a pleasant city carved into the largest expanse of ponderosa pine trees in the world, at an elevation of Flagstaff, population has long been a destination for people in southern Arizona looking for a cooling respite in summer or a spot of skiing on the nearby San Francisco Peaks in winter. But rising temperatures, driven by human-induced climate change, mean that many in Flagstaff fret they are now being overrun by those fleeing sweltering cities such as Phoenix and Tucson. A pattern of climate-driven gentrification is taking hold across the US, as those who are able to retreat from floods, storms, heatwaves and wildfires shift to safer areas, bringing soaring property and rental values with them. “As it gets hotter, we are getting a lot of climate refugees,” said Coral Evans, Flagstaff mayor. “We don’t mind people moving to Flagstaff at all. But about of our housing is now second homes. The cost of living is our number one issue. “We don’t talk much about what climate change means for social justice. But where are low-income people going to live? How can they afford to stay in this city?” There are usually a tangle of reasons – jobs, love, education – as to why people decide to move, but Flagstaff agreeable climate is jostling towards the front. Last summer, Phoenix was so hot that road signs and mailboxes melted. Planes couldn’t take off or land. On a recent July day this year, when Phoenix hit Flagstaff, a two-hour drive and a world away, was Amanda Ormond moved to Phoenix in first working in bars after leaving college before becoming a clean energy consultant. Ormond recalls stuffing her children into thick coats when trawling houses for trick or treating at Halloween. By the time the family moved permanently to Flagstaff three years ago, wearing anything warmer than shorts and T-shirts at that time of year was unthinkable. It will get worse – Phoenix, the fastest-warming large city in the US, could spend close to half of its year in over heat within years. “If you choose to live in the desert you have to learn how to live in the desert,” Ormond said. “You worry about your car breaking down and so you have tons of food and water in it. “But the heat used to break around September. Now, it October, sometimes November. We literally have six months of above Mentally, you need a break. You can’t leave your house. It fatiguing.” Ormond still owns her house in Tempe, which adjoins Phoenix. “We had this home and when I look around I think, ‘I just can’t see how this is gonna be a good investment for years with climate change.’” Phoenicians able to move, or even vacation, in cooler climes such as Flagstaff are usually older and wealthier. Those who still work can often do so remotely. The influx has aroused concerns in Flagstaff, where rents and property values have soared. “The tenor in the town is ‘Stop building. Build a wall,’” said Jenny Niemann, a climate and energy specialist at the city of Flagstaff. “People joke about that. But I think it fair to say the town feels incredibly stressed by the increasing prices, as well as the development.” While the western US is increasingly baked by heatwaves and choked by smoke from wildfires, the pressing concern in eastern states is that their coasts are being redrawn by sea level rise and pummeled by ever-stronger hurricanes. More than homes near US coasts face being chronically flooded within years . This unfolding scenario is reshaping previous lines of segregation in coastal cities. As investors shift capital to higher ground and shoreline properties become costlier in terms of insurance and repairs, low- to middle-income people are squeezed out from both areas. A recent study of the greater Miami area shows this process is already under way – properties at high elevations are experiencing rising values, while those situated just above sea level have declined in value, even when other factors are accounted for. This trend has largely taken hold since “It a pretty clear signal and there evidence it happening across the US,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard who authored the Miami report. “The very wealthy can afford to throw money away but moderate- to low-income people can’t, so there an inequality to living immediately on the coast.” According to Keenan, climate gentrification is not just a supply problem – real estate developers actively marketing elevated areas as safe investments – but also a demand one – buyers are starting to swarm to higher ground. “This is happening neighborhood to neighborhood, city to city, state to state,” he said. “It such a huge spectrum of geography that we are going to have make moral judgments about what to protect and what to let go. There not enough money to protect everyone. We need a complete mobilization, similar to the effort of putting a man on the moon, to adapt our coasts.” Residents of the Miami districts of Liberty City and Little Haiti, traditionally African American and Hispanic areas, are seeing their neighborhoods transform around them. The districts, which sit a relatively safe above sea level, are currently having holes punched into them by bulldozers to make way for half a dozen apartment developments. “We are already seeing low-income homes and businesses being evicted, the new developments are popping up everywhere,” said Valencia Gunder, a Liberty City resident turned activist who grew up hearing warnings about gentrification that are now being realized. Previously blighted by poverty and crime, Liberty City is now seen as an attractive base for those worried their beachfront properties will soon be swamped. In no one in Liberty City paid more than a month in rent – now it roughly one in six . Property prices have also risen sharply. “People are being forced out to places like Georgia and Alabama, where it more affordable,” said Gunder. “It becoming so expensive. These developers aren’t making Liberty City better for the people who already live here.” Even cities with cerebral approaches to climate change are at risk of upheavals that cut deepest in poorer, minority communities. Norfolk, Virginia, has reacted to some of the fastest sea level rises in the world with an ambitious plan that cedes some territory to the tides, while breaking up some housing projects and relocating residents. Local activists worry this will mean low-income, black communities will be displaced as their coastal neighborhoods are gentrified. “This is a red alarm issue,” said Mustafa Ali, who spent years at the Environmental Protection Agency office of environmental justice. “We need to make better decisions around resilience and vulnerable communities need to be brought into that conversation. A whole lot of folks are being left behind.” In Flagstaff, the city is already straining to keep up. “Town gets crazy on the weekends when it in Phoenix,” said Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff head of sustainability. “Are we building our systems in a manner that can support a massive influx? No. Can our existing infrastructure support that? No.” Flagstaff also faces its own climate change threats – increased wildfires in the surrounding Coconino national forest, the associated risk of flooding rains washing freely down treeless slopes on to the city, pressure on the water supply. Growing numbers of homeless people are traveling to Flagstaff to camp in the woods, heightening local fears over unintended conflagration. Antonopoulos, who has helped develop a draft climate plan for Flagstaff to confront this new reality, recalls the sky turning black from ash after the nearby Schultz fire, in “I was walking to work with a bandanna on and literally chunks of burning trees were falling everywhere,” she said. “When we’ve got climate refugees it going to put more stress not only on our infrastructure but also our natural resources.” The hand of climate change is everywhere – from water availability to insurance markets to housing pricing – while rarely being identified as a culprit. As temperatures continue to escalate, prior inequities are likely to be exacerbated, injustices risk deepening. “Whether it happening already is unclear but I think more and more people are going to be moving because of climate change,” said Brian Petersen, a climate change and planning academic at Northern Arizona University. “The people marginalized already in society will bear the brunt of this. Poor people in Las Vegas or Phoenix who can’t get away from the heat are not going to be leaving to go to beautiful, expensive mountain towns.” Even those who do make it to Flagstaff and other refuges, such as Oregon or near the Great Lakes, won’t be shielded from the transforming climate. Enough future warming has been locked into the world climate system to touch everywhere on Earth. “At some point, Flagstaff going to be in the rear-view mirror,” said Petersen. “We’re going to be going to farther north places or other continents.”",1573,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/climate-gentrification-phoenix-flagstaff-miami-rich-poor
33,"he party at Bait &amp; Tackle didn’t look like a funeral. The bar was packed with people double-fisting drinks and dancing. But every now and then you caught someone go quiet, stare at the ceiling, take a deep breath and sigh, eyes glimmering. “It a lot to take in,” said a woman to a friend standing next to her. “Where are you gonna go for happy hour now?” she asked. “I don’t know,” her friend answered. “Nowhere.” A grey-haired man behind the bar gave a bottle of vodka to a customer who knocked back its last dregs. Barry O’Meara was not just the bartender – he also owned the place, which he had opened years ago. But on January it was coming to an end. O’Meara would close Bait &amp; Tackle for good. Until then, Bait &amp; Tackle had been a neighborhood bar in Red Hook, Brooklyn . O’Meara was shutting it down because the neighborhood was not what it used to be. The people moving to Red Hook – “the new people”, he said – were displacing his customers, who could no longer afford their rent. “And the people moving in don’t frequent establishments like this,” O’Meara said. “So that it.” It was not the ending anyone had expected five years earlier. In October of O’Meara had stood on the street outside Bait &amp; Tackle watching the ocean draw nearer and nearer. Soon water was pouring into the basement of his bar. With its narrow rivers, estuaries and islands, New York City is extremely vulnerable to coastal flooding. Red Hook lies on the city floodplain. Flood maps show that Red Hook – a low, flat peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides – wouldn’t stand a chance in the case of a flood”, a weather event so massive it has a chance of occurring every year. It might not sound like much of a risk, but is a deceptively small number. As Arctic glaciers melt, and oceans grow warmer and expand, sea levels are rising. Storms that would have been too weak to push the water to shore in the past will become powerful enough to do so. In the near future, what we think of as floods might be more like or floods. Soon, it won’t take a heavy storm for Red Hook streets to flood. According to scientists’ projections, the city piers will vanish under high tide in the By a normal high tide will flood some streets. Part of Van Brunt Street, Red Hook main thoroughfare, is expected to flood daily. Hurricane Sandy, in offered a grim preview of Red Hook future. The storm, which devastated areas all over New York and left dead in the city, hit Red Hook particularly hard. As water gushed out of sewers and into streets, parks and basements, residents were forced to remember that Red Hook used to be a tidal marsh and that old, hidden creeks still stream under the asphalt like veins under the city skin. After the storm, Red Hook residents who owned their homes believed their property had lost its value overnight. The truth was more surprising. Over the next several years, Red Hook home prices soared. It turned out that, storm or no storm, there were people in New York City and beyond who were willing to pay more than for the chance to live on a floodplain. Red Hook transformation was tangible. Two blocks of new luxury townhouses rose on King and Sullivan Streets. In Tesla opened a showroom there. More and more tourists wandered in for new and rebuilt galleries, restaurants and bars. An old factory, right by the water, was turned into million-dollar condos. The Puerto Rican family that owned the Bait &amp; Tackle building sold it to an investment company in and O’Meara rent shot up by Rising rents pushed more than a dozen of O’Meara friends out of the neighborhood and, in many cases, out of the city entirely. Many Red Hook residents saw their neighborhood as the last bastion of real New York: a place where regular people with regular jobs could still afford to live. That “authenticity” was also part of its charm in the eyes of newcomers – but that didn’t reassure people like O’Meara, who felt the bastion was under attack, not only from the rising sea but from newcomers and their middle-class lifestyle too. Five years after the storm, O’Meara said that Sandy was the beginning of the end for the neighborhood. Then he corrected himself: “There no such thing as a fucking end. But it was the beginning of something different.” Andrew Amendola is the fourth Amendola to live in the slender, four-story building on Van Brunt Street. He is an only child who grew up without a mother but who shared the house with his father, grandmother, great-uncle and two great-aunts. When Amendola was a kid, Bait &amp; Tackle was still a bait and tackle shop. Back then, in the late Amendola and his father used to break through a fence, on to the shore that is now home to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, and go crabbing. All they needed was a net and the huge blue claws were theirs for the taking. The silhouette of lower Manhattan shone just a mile away but there was nobody else by the water. Amendola was years old when he saw Barry O’Meara for the first time. The teen had sneaked over to his window to smoke a cigarette when he saw a white guy, back then a rare sight on Van Brunt Street, walking by below. He didn’t know the guy, so he shouted: “Go home, yuppie!” O’Meara, a fourth-generation bartender, was hardly a yuppie. He had grown up in a small Irish village where his great-grandfather had a bar. He had served his first drink when he was eight. When he heard Amendola shout, he looked up and shouted back: “Andrew? I’m gonna tell your father that you’re smoking.” Immediately, the window slammed shut. One afternoon in November Amendola was volunteering behind the bar at a VFW veterans’ club across from his home. His girlfriend came in and took a seat. Amendola fixed her a bloody mary, went to the other end of the bar, and made a quick phone call. “What did the guy want?” Amendola girlfriend asked. “He wanted to offer for the building. I said no, we’re not getting rid of it.” Amendola gets calls from real estate developers and private equity firms on a regular basis. When his great-aunt Sue Amendola died last fall, the calls got even more frequent. “These people are predatory,” Amendola said. He witnessed the same happen after Sandy. After the market took a hit because of the storm, people came to Red Hook looking to buy. But Amendola has no intention of selling the house where he grew up. Neither nor the threat of another hurricane are enough to make him abandon a place that holds all his memories. More than money or safety, he values that he can walk down the block and be annoyed that he has to say “hi” at least to three people. “Like, ‘Oh, this fucking guy, I don’t want to see him right now.’ But I actually like not wanting to see them,” he said. At Amendola plans to spend the rest of his life in Red Hook, just like generations of Amendolas before him did. Red Hook desirability is rising because, unlike elsewhere in Brooklyn, townhouses are still relatively affordable there. Some gentrifiers come because they want their kids to attend the local private school that opened a year after Sandy. (Next year tuition: Others come because Red Hook is different from most other parts of the city. It is quiet, like a seaside village, except you can see the Statue of Liberty. You can see the sky. You can breathe. It easy to forget that people didn’t always want to live on the waterfront. In cities, the rivers used to smell. Water meant pollution and waste, and waterfronts were where the cities pushed the working class, the poor, the new immigrants. It is not a coincidence that Fifth Avenue is as far from any river as possible. This started to change in when Congress passed the Clean Water Act and water quality across the United States started to improve. At the same time, industry was abandoning cities, leaving behind vacant parcels that eventually attracted commercial developers and wealthy new residents. Across the world, urban waterfronts have become the most desirable, expensive locations, even though water is rising. That one of the many quirks of Red Hook and places like it. After more than a century of living inland, the rich – suddenly yearning to live by the water – are pushing the poor and middle class out. This migration might save longtime waterfront residents from rising waters, but it doesn’t save them from losing their homes. On the other hand, many of the low-income residents who still live on the shore don’t have any choice but to stay. Much of New York public housing is concentrated by the water, in Red Hook, Coney Island, the Lower East Side, the Rockaways. Red Hook has one of the oldest and biggest public housing projects in the country. More than half of Red Hook residents are tenants of the New York City Housing Authority. Without government investment in flood protection, they are in harm way. Coastal megacities from London to Tokyo and Rotterdam to Shanghai have installed seawalls, storm surge barriers, super-levees and dyke-rings to keep the water out of the streets. New York has not. Americans are better at immediate disaster response than planning for the future, experts say. In the future, there could be less and less government support for struggling working people in places like Red Hook. Flood protection, many urban planners predict, may only be available to those who can afford to pay for it themselves. In November , Andrew Amendola was decorating the vacant lot next to his house for Christmas. Mounting a nativity scene was a family tradition. The afternoon sun made the plastic angels shimmer gold, while a gust of wind blew a reindeer over. “Go home, reindeer, you’re drunk,” Amendola said. The lot is home to four cats. After Sandy, he was sure that they had died. But a few days after the storm, they found their way back. Unlike many people, they had evacuated. If you asked real estate developer Chris Ward, he might say that the vacant lot is another parcel of scarce New York land being underutilized. Ward, now a senior vice-president at the global engineering giant Aecom, has a long history of working with New York waterfronts. In September Ward told the Brooklyn Eagle, a local paper, that Red Hook had two options: to become populated with high-rise buildings, co-ops and condos, or to remain the “underutilized low-income, unconnected community it is today”. Aecom had just announced a proposal to radically transform the neighborhood into a hub of gleaming skyscrapers. The plan included a subway line from Manhattan and new apartments in high-rises. In his State of the State address, New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, put “revitalizing” Red Hook on his agenda and called on the Port Authority to consider relocating the operations of Red Hook remaining port, the Red Hook Container Terminal, to Sunset Park. He also asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to study options to extend the subway from lower Manhattan to Red Hook, a key component of Aecom vision for Red Hook reinvention. Robert Pincus, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, moved to Red Hook after Sandy because his rent in Carroll Gardens, on the other side of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, spiked. In Red Hook, his family could afford to rent a home. He wouldn’t buy property in Red Hook: he too aware of the climate risks. But he understands why Aecom and other developers have their eyes on the neighborhood. “There are billions of dollars to be made,” Pincus said. “The developers make them in or years, and only then the land will flood.” Chris Ward disagrees with this view. He sees new development as a way to build and finance flood protection in waterfront cities across the globe. “Most cities are taking the approach that with thoughtful architectural design and engineering we can ameliorate the risk at at an acceptable level,” he told the Guardian. Aecom is not the only company going after the neighborhood. According to the New York Times, Related Companies, a major real estate developer, is also circulating a draft plan on Red Hook revitalization. The plan is titled “New York Next Big Thing”. On his final night at his bar , Barry O’Meara got to the bar tiny stage for his final speech. He had to wait a little for the crowd to quiet down and listen. “We have made friends for life and we have made enemies for life,” O’Meara said into a microphone, with his usual flair for drama. A slideshow of pictures ran on a screen behind him. In one photo, a sign outside Bait &amp; Tackle said “FREE HURRICANE ADVICE”. In Sandy aftermath, Bait &amp; Tackle became one of the central neighborhood hubs where people went for help and company. In the years since Sandy, residents of Red Hook and New Yorkers in general have been asking themselves: what is the right thing to do after such a disaster? How do you make plans when you know that it might happen again, but you don’t know if it going to be next month, next year, or in three decades? It seems like the rational thing to do would be to leave the waterfront and find a new home – somewhere on higher ground, somewhere safe. But that not how people choose a place to live. There are other, more immediately compelling factors to consider. What can you afford? Where feels like home? Where are your friends and family, your favorite bar, your kid school? Knowing your neighbors or having a perfect view of the Statue of Liberty can outweigh a far-off-seeming flood risk. It not easy to leave a place you love – even if the place, by virtue of its geography, promises to one day kill you. In Bait &amp; Tackle, O’Meara speech was almost over. People raised their voices. First, one at a time: “We love you, Barry!” And then all together: “Barry! Barry! Barry!” O’Meara told them to shut up. “I’m not sad,” he said, interrupting the chant. “This room has been too great and too beautiful with happiness and laughter and joy to be sad. I’ve been fucking privileged. Let continue the night. I love you all. Thank you.” After the speech, the DJ put on David Bowie Let Dance. Amendola stood next to the bar wearing a T-shirt bearing the words he once shouted to O’Meara: “Go home, yuppie!” Now, he wiped away tears.",2499,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/red-hook-climate-change-floodplain-hurricane-sandy-gentrification
34,"Climate change is fueling heatwaves, hurricanes and floods, gradually making certain places in the US challenging, if not outright miserable, to live in. Scientists, and some members of the public, are starting to question where in the US will remain comfortable to call home. The answer, broadly speaking, is north and maybe west. Florida has seen a population boom in recent decades but the southern portion of the state is on course to be submerged by rising seas. The Gulf coast will get supercharged hurricanes, while the south-west and south-east US will be baked by increasingly hostile heat. “Areas towards the north and away from the ocean and that central corridor where you get tornadoes probably look best,” said Vivek Shandas, an expert on climate change impact on cities at Portland State University. Shandas recommends looking to live in a “band roughly above the parallel” – a line of latitude that divides New York and Pennsylvania and forms the southern borders of Oregon and Idaho. Places close to a reliable source of water without being flood-prone as the seas rise are attractive, such as areas near the Great Lakes and the Pacific north-west. “Seattle doesn’t break that often so it’ll be nothing like Phoenix in terms of tolerability of heat,” said Shandas. “Places like Portland, Oregon, and Boise, Idaho, will be relatively safeguarded, apart from a bit of wildfire smoke.” There will be bastions elsewhere. “Cincinnati, for example, is surprisingly good,” said Shandas. “It close to the Great Lakes, away from hurricanes, away from the eastern seaboard. It will get more heatwaves, but then again we all will.” Much of the east coast will look dicey if the seas rise at such a pace that they’ll be higher by the end of the century, but plenty will rest on local decisions made to shield residents from flooding. New York City, for example, is flanked by rising water and is already stiflingly hot in summer, but a multibillion-dollar strategy to build flood defenses and buy out vulnerable areas should help stave off the worst impacts. Climate resiliency is a growing focus for many towns and cities that fret about expensive clean-up costs from disasters, shading people from the heat or dealing with an eroding tax base should residents decide to uproot and head somewhere safer. The scope of these climate considerations is vast, touching on everything from transport links to the availability of flood insurance. Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, said that he likes Buffalo, New York, and Duluth, Minnesota, as climate refuges as they tick many of the appropriate boxes. “Their sources of energy production are stable, they have cooler climates and they have access to plenty of fresh water,” Keenan said. “They also have less vulnerability to forest fires, as compared to somewhere like the Pacific north-west. They also have a legacy of excess infrastructural capacity that allows them to diversify their economy in the future. Land prices are cheap and they have a relatively well-educated and skilled labor force.” These safe havens are more of a fantasy wishlist for many moderate-to low-income people as property and rental values rise in desirable areas. Others won’t want to leave more vulnerable parts of the US due to more umbilical links, to family and jobs and a sense of home. “As we saw after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria, communities that are able to move can do so, especially if family and friends do the same,” said Shandas. “Those with less resources are left behind.”",588,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/climate-change-where-to-move-us-avoid-floods-hurricanes
35,"he single track road, its potholes patched and repatched like a threadbare jacket, plummets down to the burn and up again in a steep V. Along its unfenced verges, the wind tugs at thistledown and at sparse clumps of gorse, the occasional hawthorn. Goldfinches flurry along. Impervious sheep graze the sloping fields. This is where the Kingswood Burn runs through a cleugh, the Northumberland word for a ravine. Trees cluster the sides, delineating the watercourse, a thick-grown quiet place for owls and deer. There a mixture of holly and birch, hawthorn and sycamore, and, in the wettest places, alder. I look down on to this snaking wood and, over it, to the zigzag of the narrow road as it crosses ridge after ridge and think about the uphill walk once I have descended to the stream. Down in the valley bottom there a little stone bridge. A group of red-legged partridges scurry up a sandy bank, their plumage a series of rusty bars over delicate grey. In the rough grass, shaggy ink caps cluster, some turning sludgy black as their spores develop. As I start the climb, there a rhythmical line of beech trees to my left. They curve like a breaking wave, branches sweeping up from the west to bend down to the east, moulded by gales and weather. Growing closely, maybe they’re an outgrown hedge or planted densely to provide some shelter. Their roots wrap over boulders, trunks knuckle and bulge, branches weld together or gesture out at odd angles. It hard not to relate them to human forms with their hints of limbs and faces. These trees inspired the Allendale printmaker Cat Moore . It was seeing her linocut at the Gallery in the Hills , a converted barn at the top of this hill, that prompted me to revisit these special beeches. Now, looking back down on the cleugh, I see what I missed before. This road could only have been made after the invention of the motor vehicle. A much older track, a sunken green line, hugs the hillside at an angle more suitable for horse and cart.

36,"Environmentally friendly gardeners who attempt to deter slugs and snails from devouring their vegetables with eggshells or copper tape are wasting their time, according to a study by the Royal Horticultural Society . Gastropods inflicted the same damage to lettuces protected with five natural methods – eggshells, copper tape, horticultural grit, pine bark mulch and wool pellets – as they did to lettuces left untreated. These methods were tested on lettuces sown in pots and raised beds at the RHS field research facility in Wisley . After six weeks, the leaves of each harvested lettuce were examined to calculate damage. Lettuces planted in the ground were found to be more susceptible to slugs, with of each eaten on average. This compares to just of those in pots, which, despite this advantage, yielded less crop. The natural methods were thought ineffective because slugs and snails’ thick mucus enables them to glide over these apparently sharp barriers. But wool pellets and pine bark did have one clear benefit: by acting as a fertiliser and mulch, they helped lettuces yield a bigger crop. According to the RHS, some slug species have clear benefits for gardeners, such as the leopard slug, which eats fungi and rotting material, helping recycle garden nutrients. But Dr Hayley Jones, entomologist at the RHS and lead researcher, said: “With the likes of eggshells, barks and mulch so far proving no discernible deterrent to slugs and snails, we would recommend using proven formulas like nematode biological control if the damage is just too much to bear.” Nematodes are microscopic parasitic worms that feed upon molluscs but also risk killing non-pest garden species such as water snails. Say goodbye to slugs, snails, mice and badgers Jones added: “Slug pellets do have their problems but they have been tested for safety and when used to their manufacturers’ instructions the risks are quite minimal. It becomes dangerous for pets and other wildlife when they are overapplied.” Previous research revealed that gardeners who handpick slugs and snails from their vegetables must dispatch them more than metres away , because otherwise a homing instinct can help them return. Jones said of this method: “It is time-consuming but it is definitely the most environmentally friendly way to go about it.” One famous method not yet tested is beer traps. Jones said she would like to test this method because there is a risk such traps only lure more slugs on to gardeners’ vegetable patches.",408,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/eggshell-and-copper-tape-do-not-protect-veg-from-slugs-and-snails
37,"A Seattle-area fish processor who hoped to cash in on China appetite for sea cucumber faces years in prison for his role in a poaching scheme that rocked an already unstable fishery. Federal prosecutors claim Hoon Namkoong led a years-long operation to poach and sell sea cucumbers as regulators were cutting the struggling Washington state fishery. Dozens of divers are also implicated in the poaching ring. Namkoong bought at least of stolen sea cucumber taken illegally from waters once rich with the echinoderms. A leading US sea cucumber wholesaler, Namkoong made millions selling to buyers domestically and in China, where demand has spiked for sea cucumber. Namkoong, faces up to two years in prison when he is sentenced on Friday. Sea cucumber is a luxury food and traditional medicine in China. Demand for them has risen as Chinese incomes have grown, and the inflation-adjusted price paid to fishermen has more than doubled since the early Sea cucumber stocks are under threat globally as fishermen dive to meet demand. “My old boss says they make a really good clam dip,” joked Hank Carson, a Washington department of fish and wildlife research scientist who studies and manages the state sea cucumber fishery. Cousins to the starfish and sea urchin, sea cucumbers are prized for the five bands of muscle cocooning their gooey centers. They are collected by divers linked to the surface by hose, then split and drained at sea. Processors like Namkoong buy the gutted cucumber, which is then dehydrated for sale. For being such simple creatures … they’re really bizarre Sea cucumber stocks in Washington fell dramatically during what Carson described as the fishery “gold rush” in the late and In a pattern repeated in fisheries worldwide, Washington sea cucumber harvest – once America largest – ballooned to an unsustainable level before fears of a collapse prompted regulation to protect the poorly understood creature. “They’re really mysterious animals,” Carson said. “For being such simple creatures … they’re really bizarre.” Sea cucumber change their size and weight on demand, spewing or inhaling water. Their migration patterns are unknown and the age of an individual cucumber is impossible to discern. They sometimes eviscerate themselves, expelling their internal organs, though researchers aren’t sure why they do so. Carson, who was Washington leading sea cucumber regulator while the poaching was occurring, said he is optimistic the fishery can rebound. Tribal fishermen, whose treaty rights afford them half the sea cucumber catch, and their non-tribal counterparts had been sacrificing to preserve the fishery. The poachers threatened that work. Sea cucumber fishermen must report their catch to regulators, who decide when the annual quota has been harvested. Namkoong and more than fishermen cheated the system by dramatically underreporting the catch, which Namkoong paid for in part with cash. Poached sea cucumbers were salted and dried at Orient Seafood Production, Namkoong suburban Seattle processing plant. Chinese appetite for totoaba fish bladder kills off rare porpoise “That was a big setback,” said Carson, describing the poaching ring impact on the fishery management. “Lawful harvesters were making cuts, and unlawful harvesters were taking more.” Namkoong pleaded guilty in April to conspiring to violate a federal law prohibiting poaching and wildlife trafficking. Prosecutors have asked that he be ordered to pay in restitution and serve a two-year prison term. “Namkoong caused this stressed resource to be over-harvested by over pounds,” the assistant US attorney Matthew Diggs said in court papers. “He did so for the sole reason of enriching himself.” In letters filed with the court, Namkoong friends described him as a generous, hardworking business owner well-regarded within his industry. Defense attorney Wayne Fricke argued that Namkoong was motivated in part by a desire to “help those divers who were attempting to make a living”. While Namkoong hopes to be spared prison when he is sentenced on Friday, prosecutors have asked that he receive a two-year term. He is expected to be sentenced by the US district judge Ricardo Martinez in Seattle.",662,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/sea-cucumber-poacher-washington
38,"n these last green weeks before nature traffic lights turn the trees to red and amber, there is little visible sign among them of the effects of a droughty summer. Though the garden rain gauge registered just of rainfall in weeks from the end of May, it poured all through August, a daily deluge of birch seeds that filled every crack and cranny and clogged the spiders’ webs with vegetarian fare. Drought-stressed silver birches cast unprecedented numbers of offspring into the wind, limes launched innumerable helicopter seeds to fall on parched soil, and oaks did not appear to even attempt their late summer spurt of Lammas growth . But in the autumnal reckoning, it appears to be photosynthesis as usual. A terrible exception with a plague-struck appearance stands on Thorncote Green and in a million other places. The horse chestnut has gone into moth-induced winter, its rust-brown foliage the colour of death and decay. The giant leaves, which unfurled and splayed in spring into shapes like the feet of prehistoric birds, have curled up their toes. Thousands litter the ground in a premonition of December. The wrinkled, crinkled survivors – barely surviving – hang on. Four hundred years after the horse chestnut was introduced to Britain, a new species to science, Cameraria ohridella , a leaf-miner moth, followed it from the Balkans. The female lays her eggs into chestnut leaves and there the hatched larvae stay, as if they were sealed in an envelope, eating their way through the contents. Blue tits are among the most assiduous of bug hunters in the canopy, yet they are only able to take less than one in The tough skin that protects the chlorophyll factory cocoons its parasite, its nemesis.

39,"Experts are monitoring a beluga whale in the Thames estuary for a second day as fears grow for its safety. The whale movements are being monitored by experts on a Port of London Authority patrol boat moored to a barge east of Gravesend. Speaking to the Guardian from the boat, the authority spokesman Martin Garside, said: “I can see it now. It a beautiful animal – a ghostly looking thing. It is popping up every few minutes for a few seconds, more or less in exactly the same place as yesterday.” The beluga was first spotted in the estuary on Tuesday , miles east of London and miles from its normal habitat in the Arctic. It is believed to have veered off course in search of food. Garside said: “It is diving as if it is looking for food. We are reviewing options. The species could theoretically live off the stuff in the Thames estuary.” Hundreds of onlookers have lined the banks of the Thames east of Gravesend hoping for a glimpse of the whale. But boat owners are being urged to keep away. Garside said: “There was another boat in the area which we asked to leave. It was private citizen who wanted to take some photos. We have turned our engines off and we are tied up to one of the barges, so our footprint as far as the whale is concerned is minute.” Sally Hamilton, director of the whale and dolphin charity Orca, said it was worrying that the beluga was still lingering in the area. She said: “The key is to ensure that the whale isn’t disturbed and carries on feeding. It needs to consume of its body weight [each day] so as long as it carries on feeding we are hopeful it would make its own way out of the Thames.” Rob Deaville, who is from London Institute of Zoology and responsible for investigating all whale strandings in the UK, said it was too early to try to rescue the beluga. He said: “We really can’t intervene at this stage. There is not much you can do in an estuarine environment. There are some things we might begin to look at downstream involving herding, but that carries a risk of stranding too, so it is really not something we should be considering at this stage.” Deaville, who is contracted by the government to conduct post-mortems on all stranded whales in the UK, said it was very uncommon for belugas to get stranded on the British coast. He said: “The last beluga whale stranding we had in the UK was in with a very decomposed animal in Scotland. And prior to that the last one in the UK was in so strandings of belugas are really rare.” Deaville pointed out that belugas are often found feeding in estuaries, but not this far south. He said: “As a species, they can cope quite happily in estuarine environments. “But it is in a busy shipping lane and there lots of media helicopters overflying it at the moment. We are trying to discourage that and leave it to its own devices. The down draft from helicopters can also cause risks of stranding.” He added: “We don’t know if it lost. I understand the speculation that it might be linked to changes in the Arctic area, but one animal does not make a trend. If we see many more animals out of habitat then that might be more cause for concern about a wider issue. But we can’t say that yet.” Samantha Lipman, from British Divers Marine Life Rescue, a charity that specialises in saving marine animals in distress around the UK, also urged the media and the public to keep a safe distance. Lipman, the charity Thames area coordinator on standby near the scene, said: “It is illegal to disturb or harass any whale, dolphin or porpoise in British waters. It is the same with helicopters that have been going overhead. Noise from above and the wind movement from propellers is going to affect them and could start herding the animal in a direction we don’t want it to go in.” She expressed concern that the beluga could go further upriver towards central London. “The further up you go, the busier the river is,” she said. “A sighting will attract more traffic so we are really urging people to watch from shore if it is around.” The lonely Thames beluga whale is an anomaly – and an omen | Philip Hoare “If it were to deteriorate and look as if it was in trouble, or it did actually strand, then we have got a team of medics and volunteers ready to intervene if necessary.” The Environment Agency said it was not planning to close the Thames barrier to prevent the beluga from swimming further upriver. Garside, also played down the prospect of closing the barrier. “That would be a huge decision to take and a desperate last resort. And it would only stop it moving from one part of Woolwich to another part of Woolwich. It would be in a right old pickle if it ends up there,” he said.",861,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/beluga-whale-spotted-again-in-thames-amid-concerns-for-its-safety
40,"s an ocean early warning system, coral reefs have been sounding the alarm for years. They have been bleached white by marine heatwaves and killed off en masse by a combination of factors including pollution, overfishing, acidification and climate change. But now scientists in Florida , and other tropical locations worldwide, are attempting to stop the rot by creating coral “nurseries” in which young populations can be raised in controlled conditions before being planted on denuded reefs. Off the southern tip of Florida, a sprawling marine farming operation has been established in which corals are painstakingly grown on anchored fibreglass trees and then planted on the barrier reef. “The idea is to do as much as we can now to give these coral populations a fighting chance,” says Jessica Levy, programme manager at the Coral Restoration Foundation . “If you don’t put back the material and diversity that has been lost, the populations are going to crash and become extinct. For reefs, you’re looking at a global extinction of the ecosystem if things don’t change quickly.” Florida has the world third largest barrier reef, with nearly species of plants and animals and species of fish, but the reef is vanishing fast. Research found that roughly half of the reef has disappeared over the past years. Coverage of acropora, the primary genus of reef-building corals, has plummeted by “The reef is pretty barren right now,” says Levy. The maladies are numerous and stretch back decades. A burgeoning Floridian population and mass tourism have led to water pollution and direct damage to corals, while agriculture has sent torrents of nutrients flowing on to the reef. Although regulations have curbed some of these local risks, climate change remains a big threat. In a spike in water temperatures led the Florida corals to bleach – when a reef expels its symbiotic algae under heat stress, whitens and potentially dies. It happened again in , as a prolonged global bleaching event gripped the planet corals. Australia Great Barrier Reef was cooked to the point that it reportedly smelled of death . The world is on course for a temperature increase that will comfortably wipe out most of the coral ecosystems, a scenario that would strip away a crucial nursery and smorgasbord for countless marine species, diminish fisheries and remove a vital coastal buffer to storms that will intensify as the planet warms. “The outlook for the Florida reef is pretty grim,” says Kim Cobb, a coral expert at Georgia Institute of Technology. “The threats are overwhelming. Just as the reef is climbing out of decades of systemic problems it is under increasing threat from climate change.” The Coral Restoration Foundation has increased the replanting of corals as the situation has deteriorated, and the foundation underwater trees are becoming sought-after items for stressed reefs around the world. Partnerships have formed to provide trees to places such as Jamaica and Colombia. A chartered fishing operation in Mexico is in talks to do the same. This month, it was announced that corals had been successfully planted on the Great Barrier Reef , the world largest living structure, using the coral tree frames. The operation came about after tropical fish collector Ken Nedimyer noticed a rare type of coral called Acropora cervicronis growing on his live rock farm in A loophole in endangered species laws meant the coral was his to keep, so he began cutting it up to grow new coral from the fragments. Nedimyer hoped to regrow enough coral to start patching up Florida reef. Initially, the fragments were mounted on sunken concentric blocks that mimicked reefs. But the real breakthrough came in with the development of fabricated trees on which dozens of pieces of coral can be dangled from the branches. Backed by funding from the federal government and concerned donors, the foundation now has around trees arranged in seven nurseries along the reef system as far as Ernest Hemingway old haunt of Key West. Retrieved fragments of wild coral are sliced into finger-sized pieces, sorted into genomic types and strung from the fibreglass and PVC trees, which are anchored to the seabed and buoyed with a float. Alongside the staghorn and elkhorn corals, swaying gently on lines in the currents, are boulder-covering corals that are mounted on nearby platforms. This environment lets the corals grow three times faster than normal. Even so, it takes up to nine months for them to reach the size of a small football, at which point they are taken to be attached to an appropriate reef using a special putty. Diversity is key, says Levy. While some other projects are experimenting with heat-resistant corals that can cope with occasionally warming waters, the foundation hopes a range of coral candidates will produce survivors. “We don’t want to put all our eggs in the heat tolerance basket,” she says. The aim is for the corals to take root, connect and spawn with each other. So far in more than corals have been planted on to reefs, double that achieved annually five years ago. Around eight in planted corals survive at least a year. This work is laborious and occasionally fraught. The trees need to be regularly cleaned of detritus, while around coral genotypes across nine species must be sorted and tagged. Regrown coral can be swiftly wiped out by hot or cold snaps, storms or disease. Hurricane Irma stripped corals off the trees, although the structures themselves were almost all unscathed. “We lost a fair bit of stock with Irma,” says Levy. “This work can be very hard as well as very rewarding. You plant corals and watch them grow for several years and then something out of your control like bleaching can happen. “It just makes us go for the numbers – the more corals we get out there the more diverse it will be and the better chance something is going to survive past the continued stress.” The largest of the nurseries, located three miles off the Key Largo coast, has around trees, which look a bit like giant, antiquated TV aerials. Branching staghorn and elkhorn coral dangle from the trees just underwater. A constellation of marine life, such as trumpet fish, hog fish and trigger fish, flit between the trees. A nearby reef site is dotted with replanted corals bearing the tags of the Coral Restoration Foundation, although the overall coral coverage is scant. The bleak scene is completed by stands of lifeless pillar coral, ravaged by a bacterial disease that swept through the Keys last summer. A nearby brain coral is split by jagged white lines, further evidence of disease. The origins of many coral diseases are vague but at least one major outbreak has been linked to human faecal waste: the Keys only gained a fully functioning sewer system during the past decade. Recent research has found that these diseases will worsen as the oceans warm. The scale of the foundation task is “monumental”, says Cobb. But the restoration work could help provide a lifeline for reefs, she says. “Corals made it through the impact that killed the dinosaurs,” she says. “I believe some corals will limp through, the question is how much will be left. There is important work that holds real promise. There won’t be just one solution but a whole basket of them, some of which we can only guess at.” Another form of reef renovation has been taking place in the Bahamas, where scientists have been collecting material from mass spawning events – when corals release plumes of sperm and eggs into the water en masse – to help produce more numerous, stronger offspring for replanting. “We’ve had pretty good results,” says Joseph Pollock, coral strategy director for the Caribbean division of the Nature Conservancy . He worked on a recent spawning event off Cape Eleuthera that has resulted in more than one million coral larvae. “This in itself is not a solution, it part of a suite of tools that can be used. If you’re not working on stressors from climate change down to coastal pollution, you may as well not be doing this work.” Back in Florida, the Coral Restoration Foundation is training a new batch of interns, who will help in educational outreach efforts with the public. At the foundation offices, fibreglass trees are being scrubbed clean and plans made to survey a nursery site as the skies clear from a tropical storm. The work, much like the morphing climate conditions ranged against it, seems endless. “I’m not ready to give up,” says Levy. “No one wants these reefs to die on their watch, so I would rather do something then sit back and watch everything die.”",1447,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/back-from-the-brink-the-global-effort-to-save-coral-from-climate-change
41,"he tattered pennant of a speckled wood butterfly remained still as the wind roared overhead. With bits of wing missing due to bird attacks or batterings from the weather, the butterfly had been beating the bounds of its own territory until the wind cut up rough. Speckled wood butterflies, Pararge aegeria tircis , have brown, leaf-like wings illuminated by yellow-cream patches that match the dappled shadows they inhabit. Before the early century they were rare and localised, but here they have become the commonest butterflies of the woodland edge. Dryads are not much interested in flowers but are drinkers of honeydew produced by aphids feeding on leaves in the treetops. Up there, storm wraiths thrashed through their northerly migration. The air crackled with a power only visible in its effects: snapping branches, spinning ash keys, beech mast and lime seeds, flying leaves winnowed into twisting devils or flowing waves, tree trunks shaken to find ones to uproot. Even the crazy ravens that were riding the winds the day before were staying out of it now. A fleeting sunspot in fallen leaves under the shelter of trees along the path lay within the butterfly territory, which he alone defended. Speckled woods fly from March to September and have two broods, sometimes a third in October or November in a favourable year. So, despite the lateness of the season and the probability that available females, who only mate once in their lifetime, will have laid their eggs on grasses by now, the butterfly had not abandoned the prospect of fathering a late brood and was ready to spring into the air if another trespassed into his spotlight. Large blue butterfly enjoys best UK summer on record There would be more males than females around and, although they were likely to be as knackered as he was, skirmishes for ownership of the ephemeral dapples would still break out were it not for the weather.

42,"Police in Western Australia have located a critically endangered tortoise that was stolen from Perth zoo seven years ago. The discovery comes as the zoo faces intense scrutiny of its security measures, after last week theft, and subsequent recovery, of a baby meerkat. The Madagascan radiated tortoise, Astrochelys radiata , was one of two reported missing from the zoo in It was discovered at a house in Girrawheen in the city northern suburbs on September by police who were searching the property in an unrelated investigation. “It is believed the second tortoise was taken from the Girrawheen home on the same day police attended and there are concerns for the welfare of that tortoise,” a police statement said. “To survive, these tortoises require special diets and living areas, completely different to the needs of a tortoise purchased at a pet store.” Police have called for anyone with information about the second tortoise to come forward. In pursuit of the tortoise smugglers The theft is not the last time a radiated tortoise was stolen from Perth zoo. In a tortoise was taken from its enclosure and anonymously dropped off in a backpack outside a police station three days later by a buyer who, police say, had not realised it was stolen. Radiated tortoises are highly valued by wildlife smugglers and have been poached almost to the point of extinction in their native Madagascar, where the wild population halved from million to million in the past five years . They can also be notoriously tricky to look after, which is why Western Australia environment minister, Stephen Dawson, is pleased to have this one back. “I am told that they require constant care so for them to have been removed from the zoo and to have lived for seven years really is amazing,” Dawson told Guardian Australia. “Notwithstanding that, the best place for them to be kept in Australia is in a zoo. These aren’t family pets, they are endangered animals and we need to look after them.” He was hopeful the second tortoise would be recovered soon. Dawson said the zoo had increased security measures after the two tortoises were taken in moving the enclosure away from the public area. Police are investigating the theft on September of a baby meerkat, which was taken from its glass-walled enclosure and recovered by police from a house in Beverley, in Perth outer eastern suburbs, late the next day. A man has been charged with stealing the animal, and a woman with receiving it. “It a very skinny, tall glass wall; someone would have had to scale over,” Dawson said. “Once we learn what happened in relation to the meerkat then we can take any action that we need to [to increase security].” The meerkats have been moved out of public display while the investigation is ongoing and to help the stolen kit to reintegrate with its family. Dawson said the zoo took the safety and security of its animals “very seriously”, with security cameras throughout, and that security measures had to be balanced with public enjoyment and access. “It really is a balance,” he said. “People want to go to the zoo to get close to the animals, but when you have people who do these kind of acts and commit crimes then we do have to reassess. We have to keep these animals safe.”",561,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/slow-moving-justice-tortoise-recovered-seven-years-after-perth-zoo-theft
43,"urprisingly little is known about the largest fish in British waters, the basking shark, Cetorhinus maximus; for example, where does it go in winter? Even its name is misleading. When this giant is on the surface, it is not sunbathing but swimming gently along with its metre-wide mouth open, filtering tons of water to harvest the plankton. These sharks used to be hunted for their large oil-filled livers, a quarter of their body weight, which kept them buoyant. The oil was used to fuel Victorian lamps. Shark numbers are much reduced and efforts are being made to track them, identify individuals and conserve them . Sightings in UK waters are between May and October, usually along the west coast, but sharks have been seen this summer along the Channel as far east as Kent. They are thought to breed in UK waters, with a pregnancy lasting months. The young, up to six at a time, are born ready to fend for themselves and are more than one metre long. Recent research shows that these sharks are not quite as placid as thought and can swim exceedingly fast and breach – ie throw themselves more than a metre clear of the water .

44,"Chris Packham is wrong to propose banning dogs from nature reserves ( Two hundred ways to save British wildlife , Opinion, September). In fact, the enactment of such a measure would actually exacerbate the problem of dogs and nature by depriving the largest single group of green-space users in Britain, namely dog walkers, from access to countryside awareness. Instead of a knee-jerk ban, he should consider an effective alternative that balances access with conservation. If he were to visit Suffolk Wildlife Trust Carlton Marshes nature reserve on the edge of Lowestoft, he would learn how – with its dog ambassador scheme – it has managed to turn conversation into conservation. Through the scheme, Carlton dog owners have learned to access the reserve in a considerate fashion that supports the trust wildlife conservation objectives. So, for many nature reserves there is a real alternative to a blanket ban. I would, along with the staff at Carlton Marshes, be pleased to show Chris how this scheme works and share its positive results with him. Phil Brown Dalham, Suffolk Michael Bunney ( Wildlife needs a new plan for agriculture , Letters, September) is spot on to ask that we work better collectively on finding ways to modify our lifestyles, farm affordable food and look after wildlife. There is no easy fix for this “wicked problem”, as in HL Mencken “for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong”.

45,"Four anti-fracking activists face being the first environmental campaigners to be jailed for a protest in the UK since according to a lawyer representing one of them. Simon Roscoe Blevins, Richard Loizou, and Richard Roberts, were told by a judge to expect custodial sentences after being convicted of causing a public nuisance by a jury at Preston crown court in August. Another defendant, Julian Brock, pleaded guilty so did not face trial. The four men were charged after taking part in a four-day direct action protest that blocked a convoy of trucks carrying drilling equipment from entering the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool. A sentencing hearing on Tuesday at Preston crown court heard arguments from Kirsty Brimelow QC that the men would become the first environmental activists to receive jail sentences for a protest in the UK since the mass trespass on Kinder Scout in the Peak District in which marked the beginning of the right-to-roam movement. Activists have previously been given jail sentences for breaching court orders and not paying fines. Around on Tuesday July as seven lorries containing drilling equipment attempted to approach the site, Roberts, a piano restorer from London, got through a police cordon and climbed on top of the first lorry, bringing the convoy to a standstill. Loizou, a teacher from Devon,climbed onto the cab of the last lorry. At around Blevins, a soil scientist from Sheffield, also managed to climb onto one of the lorries. In the early hours of the following morning Brock, from Torquay, also climbed onto a lorry in the convoy. Fellow protesters threw blankets, food and water up to the men as they camped out on the vehicles. Loizou came down on July at after hours minutes on the lorry and was arrested. Blevins did the same at on July, having spent hours and minutes on his lorry. Roberts descended at the same day, after hours minutes. Brock did not climb down from his lorry until July at after an estimated hours and minutes. The energy firm Cuadrilla, which has received government consent to extract shale gas at two wells at Preston New Road, has said fracking is likely to start in the next few weeks. The company confirmed that lorries had brought fracking equipment to the site on Monday. Speaking for the prosecution, Craig MacGregor said the police argued that the demonstration resulted in significant travel disruption, causing the road to be closed initially until a contraflow was established. Police said local residents had seen disruption to their lives and local businesses had a loss of trade. MacGregor said lorry drivers had to stay with their cabs and were unable to return home. He said the protest had cost the police and Cuadrilla around Brimelow , head of the international human rights team at Doughty St Chambers, representing Roberts on a pro-bono basis, stressed to the judge that it had been a peaceful and political protest. She said that the right to freedom of speech went beyond “simply standing and shouting” and extended to non-violent direct action. Brimelow said the fact that central government had overturned a decision by Lancashire county council to reject Cuadrilla fracking application demonstrated that “political process has been exhausted”. She added that the judge, Robert Altham, should bear in mind that “there has been no environmental protester sentenced to jail since About people gathered outside Preston crown court on Tuesday morning to support the men – who have become known as “the Frack Free Four” – wearing red roses and holding anti-fracking banners. Isabelle Luterbacher, a yoga instructor from Devon who travelled to Preston to show support for Loizou, said: “I’m already feeling very emotional. We all are. We’ll all be devastated if it comes to a custodial sentence.” Speaking outside court, Miranda Cox, an independent councillor in Kirkham town, said: “People have come down to show their support and love for four men who behaved honourably in taking direct action last summer. “They answered a call for national solidarity to help support the people of Lancashire who have for seven years been campaigning and doing everything possible within their capabilities to fight fracking.” The hearing will conclude on Wednesday. This article was amended on September to make it clear that the claim that the men would be the first environmental protesters to be sentenced to jail since was made in argument in court by one of the defence lawyers.",738,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/four-anti-fracking-activists-face-prison-over-protest
46,"ondon air pollution history – the Victorian pea-souper fogs, the deaths of people in the smog and the Clean Air Acts that followed – are well known. Dublin, just miles away, has a different history. Here it was smog in the that prompted a ban on the sale of bituminous, or “smoky” coal in Smoke pollution dropped by and there were fewer deaths from breathing problems. The ban was rolled out to other Irish towns and many of these also recorded a reduction in winter deaths. Pollutionwatch: wood burning is not climate friendly A new study has revealed that an old menace has returned to Dublin. Although the coal ban worked in the it did not address smokeless coals and solid fuels. Wood and peat are marketed as slow-renewable , green or carbon-neutral biofuels , but their air pollution impacts can be significant . During three weeks in November and December Dublin breached World Health Organization guidelines for particle pollution on eight days. Chemical analysis of the pollution at these times showed the dominance of peat and wood smoke in the evenings. Overall, the home burning of solid fuel by just of homes was responsible for of the city particle pollution.",201,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/pollutionwatch-wood-and-peat-burning-brings-return-of-air-pollution-to-dublin
47,"One of the UK largest bus and rail operators has launched the country first air filtering bus in an effort to tackle air pollution. The Go-Ahead Group unveiled the Bluestar bus in Southampton on Thursday claiming that the new filtration system attached to the top of the vehicle will clean the air as it moves around the city. Go Ahead chief executive, David Brown said: “We are going a step further in the potential for our buses to actively clean the environment. It a huge development in our environmental leadership and we are also proud to be pioneering the prototype in the UK.” The diesel bus is fitted with a specially designed filter that its inventors say will remove ultra-fine particles from the air and trap them as the bus moves through the streets. The filter then allows the bus to blow out more pure air so that the air behind it is cleaner than that in front of it. Brown said Southampton had been chosen for the prototype as the World Health Organization revealed that the city is at its limit of unsafe air pollution . It is also one of five cities tasked with drawing up air pollution plans by the government. Brown said that if the trial is successful it could be rolled out to Go Ahead entire fleet of more than buses.",226,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/uks-first-air-filtering-bus-launches-in-southampton
48,"A huge new cruise ship terminal planned for the river Thames would lead to a surge in dangerous levels of air pollution in the heart of the capital with unknown health consequences for hundreds of thousands of people, campaigners have warned. Under the proposals, which have been given planning permission, up to giant cruise ships would dock in London every year. Each ship would need to run its diesel engines round the clock to power onboard facilities, generating the same amount of toxic emissions as almost continuously running lorries . “As we find out more about the damage air pollution is doing to people health it is unthinkable that something like this can go ahead ,” said local resident Laura Eyres, who is one of those leading the fight against the development . “There is simply no justification for having these huge ships sitting here right next to busy residential areas and schools , belching out this level of pollution with all the associated damage to people health that have now been proven.” There has been growing concern about the scale of the air pollution crisis in recent months. A slew of new research has highlighted the health risks associated with toxic air – from reduced intelligence to a rise in asthma deaths ; heart disease to spikes in Alzheimer disease and dementia . In London, the mayor, Sadiq Khan, has announced a range of measures including plans to introduce a low emissions zone banning the most polluting road vehicles from a large swath of the city from However, the Thames does not fall under his jurisdiction and campaigners fear it has become a “wild west” in terms of air pollution. “The fumes that are emitted on the river simply would not be allowed if they were coming from a road in London ,” said Eyres. “It is really worrying to think what damage these fumes are causing local residents, and if the new terminal goes ahead that is only going to get a lot worse.” The Port of London Authority (PLA) controls traffic on the Thames and admits the “marine sector” has lagged behind in terms of tackling air pollution. However, it says it is catching up and earlier this year it produced its first air quality strategy . It points out that the Thames is only responsible for of London air pollution and says emission levels will improve in the years ahead as clean marine technology comes into force. Martin Garside from the PLA said it was working with the the mayor and local authorities “to secure strong environmental standards”. He added: “With a single barge carrying the loads of lorries – the Thames helps reduce traffic and pollution on London congested roads. Over four million tonnes of cargo is transported between river terminals – removing about lorry movements from the roads.” The proposed new cruise terminal at Enderby Wharf in Greenwich is owned by Morgan Stanley , which was given planning permission for the terminal and wider residential development by Greenwich council in and updated permission in Now the council has changed its mind and is backing campaigners’ calls for Morgan Stanley to come up with a greener alternative for the cruise terminal. Residents want it to be “zero emissions”, only allowing ships that can plug into an onshore power point so they can turn off their polluting diesel engines. Eyres said: “With cruise ships planned annually and each staying for three days we face huge amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter being released into our homes every day of the summer with potentially devastating health implications.” One of the big cruise ship companies, Viking, said its ships were already fitted with the “latest technology that meets the strictest environmental regulations”. A spokesman added: “If shore side power were available then we would consider using it. In fact, we are already prepared to use shore power. Our newest ship, launched this year, has a built-in connection, and we are updating our other four ships to use shore power in order to have the capability fleetwide.” Campaigners wrote to Morgan Stanley earlier this month raising their concerns again and arguing the current plans were at odds with the company stated commitment on environmental sustainability. A spokesperson for the company said it had received the letter and was working on revised plans for the development. “We acknowledge East Greenwich Residents Association concerns and can assure [them] that our new proposals will take these concerns into account.” However, Eyres said local residents needed more than encouraging words. “We can’t rest until we see a concrete commitment from Morgan Stanley that their plans for a polluting cruise port are dead in the water.”",785,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/air-pollution-fears-fuel-fight-against-huge-new-london-cruise-ship-terminal-river-thames
49,"rom a tiny office on the top floor of the old town hall in Catford, south-east London, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah is leading a campaign to push air pollution on to the political agenda as never before. It has been claimed for years that pollution caused by motor vehicles, especially diesel cars, buses and lorries, is a killer, with talk of tens of thousands of premature deaths . But the number was always abstract, the identities of the dead unknown. Now, for the first time, campaigners have the name of a young victim they say died as a direct result of air pollution: Ella Roberta Kissi-Debrah, Rosamund daughter, and if they can prove it they believe an invisible killer will become all too real. Ella, who suffered from severe asthma, died in at the age of nine . She had been suffering asthma-related seizures like the one which killed her for three years. Kissi-Debrah says her daughter, who grew up and went to school close to the busy South Circular Road in Lewisham, had cough syncope – a condition usually associated with long-distance lorry drivers who’d been driving for decades. “I couldn’t work out why a nine-year-old child should have that,” she tells me. While Ella was alive, Kissi-Debrah sought a medical explanation for the condition. Now she is convinced it was related to air pollution, arguing that her daughter lungs had been weakened over the course of her short life, with pollution spikes then triggering the attacks that repeatedly hospitalised her in the final three years. “When she first became ill, I just went to the GP and got normal antibiotics and thought ‘a few days and that will be it’,” recalls Kissi-Debrah. “But she developed this cough and it was really strange-sounding, like a whooping cough.” The cough persisted. On the third visit to the surgery the doctor referred her to a specialist, and eventually Great Ormond Street took over Ella treatment. “By New Year Eve she was in intensive care,” says Kissi-Debrah. “It now turns out that all we were doing for the next two years was maintaining her. She would have times when the cough disappeared, but it was never long enough.” Kissi-Debrah contends that the damage her daughter suffered to her lungs in the early years of her life condemned her to death. Supported by the human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn , Kissi-Debrah is pressing for a new inquest into her daughter death that for the first time would make it explicit that pollution was the cause. To get a second inquest, they will need to show there is new evidence that was not taken into account at the original investigation in Step forward Stephen Holgate, professor of immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton, who has taken a fresh look at Ella medical records and concluded there is a “real prospect that without illegal levels of air pollution Ella would not have died”. On the basis of his findings, Cockburn – a partner at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen who represented Neville Lawrence in his fight to get the director of public prosecutions to reopen the investigation into his son Stephen murder – has written to the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox , to ask for a new inquest. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has given public backing to the call , and a response is expected from Cox in the next month. Even if he turns it down, Cockburn, who is herself asthmatic and took an interest in the issue of air pollution long before she started acting for Kissi-Debrah, says she will press ahead with a judicial review of the case, believing it to have far-reaching human rights implications. “We have met a lot of hurdles along the way,” Cockburn tells me, “because although there has been evidence that air pollution kills, which is acknowledged by experts and even the government, we’ve found a reluctance to consider it on an individual, personal basis.” Cockburn wants the terms of the new inquest to be as broad as possible: “We think it should be a human rights inquest – one of the wider type of inquests based on article of the European&nbsp;Convention&nbsp;on&nbsp;Human Rights, which is the right to life. It important to identify whether state activity was relevant to the death and what lessons can be learned to prevent future fatalities.” At that point, the personal becomes deeply political. London and many other towns and cities in the UK routinely breach EU guidelines on safety limits for nitrogen dioxide which comes mainly from diesel vehicle exhausts. They are similarly lax in observing World Health Organi zation -recommended levels on fine-particle pollution. Particulate matter , to use the academic term, comes mainly from diesel and petrol vehicle engines, brakes and the contact between tyres and the road. The particles, called PM and PM according to size, are impossible to see with the naked eye but can be deadly. They penetrate the lungs and cardiovascular system and have been linked to strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory infections. If the government failure to meet pollution limits could be tied to specific deaths, it would potentially be liable to claims for compensation. Hence, no doubt, the reluctance to move from acceptance of tens of thousands of abstract deaths to the identification of any concrete, named ones. “This is a health crisis,” says Sarah MacFadyen, head of policy at the British Lung Foundation. “People don’t always think of it in that way because it is invisible. If it was unhealthy food or dirty water coming out of the taps we would see it. The kind of air pollution that we had in the past and that everybody remembers – the great smogs – again we could see it; we could see the air that we were breathing. “But we had a Clean Air Act; we cleaned up factories, we cleaned up our industry, so you don’t get that pollution any more. Instead the pollution in our air, which in town and city centres is largely from vehicle exhausts, is invisible.” Kissi-Debrah stood for the Green party in the byelection in Lewisham East in June, coming fourth. Reducing air pollution is a central policy for the party, which sees Ella case as a potential game-changer. “If air pollution is put on the death certificate of a child who has died, that – in political and policy terms – has huge ramifications,” says London assembly member Caroline Russell, Green party national spokesperson for transport. “It would be absolutely unprecedented.” Russell says the move from purely “statistical” deaths to real deaths would encourage the revolution in thinking needed to combat air pollution. “One of the problems with getting the government to take air pollution seriously, getting the mayor [of London] to take air pollution seriously, is that the action that needs to be taken so that everyone can trust the air they breathe is pretty radical,” she says. “It is about rethinking our transport system so that everyone has access to affordable, regular and efficient public transport and are not car-dependent. That kind of transport change is difficult to bring about: we have a car-dependent culture, politicians who are frightened of the motorist, and a press that is very motor-centric.” Linking the mayor approach to air pollution with the government is perhaps unfair. Khan, who is himself asthmatic and has children who suffer from asthma, has made reducing air pollution a key policy – hence his support for Kissi-Debrah campaign for a new inquest. “London lethal air is one of the biggest health challenges of this generation,” he said last November when announcing a new central London clean air zone to be launched next year that will levy charges on high-polluting diesel vehicles. “We can’t continue breathing in air so toxic it harms children lung development and causes chronic illness and premature death.” Russell accepts the mayor is making progress but thinks he could do more. “He could consider taking the ultra-low emission zone to the so that every Londoner is covered,” she says. “He also stuck with the old-fashioned system of a cordon around an area where you pay a fixed, chunky fee to drive a non-compliant car into that area. Road pricing would be a much better and more flexible option.” “Sadiq made air pollution a key plank of his manifesto,” counters Shirley Rodrigues, London deputy mayor for environment and energy, “and as soon as he came in, one of his first actions was to support [environmental pressure group] ClientEarth legal action against the government on air quality . It about the impact on people daily lives. Most poorer communities are living on main roads, so the mayor sees this as a social justice and a health issue, not just as an environmental issue.” This summer slew of stories about the harmful effects of air pollution has hit home. New research has linked it with reduced intelligence , with changes in the structure of the heart consistent with the early stages of heart failure , and now with damage to the placentas of pregnant women and the onset of dementia . The charity Living Streets says the issue is rapidly rising up the list of public concerns. “People are definitely becoming more aware of it,” says spokeswoman Kathryn Shaw, “and parents are thinking about it when choosing schools for their children.” “The invisible is finally becoming more visible, because there has been concerted action to bring it to the attention of both the public and the politicians,” says Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King College London and chairman of the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants . “The evidence base regarding the impact of these different pollutants on health has been pretty robust for at least a decade, but the challenge has been getting it into people perception that this is an issue which affects them and their children health. But it also an issue that they are intimately involved in because they are part of the problem. They contribute to the pollution we have in our cities.” He suggests three reasons for rising awareness of air pollution over the past couple of years: the BBC starting to include air quality information in its weather forecasts, ClientEarth court victories against the government over its failure to meet EU pollution limits, and the Volkswagen “dieselgate” scandal , when it it was revealed that the carmaker was doctoring the results of laboratory tests to make its diesel vehicles appear less polluting than they were. Dieselgate was a disaster for Volkswagen and for diesel cars generally, sales of which have since fallen dramatically . Before the Volkswagen scandal the government had been actively encouraging drivers to switch to diesel cars, believing them to be more fuel-efficient and less harmful to the environment because they produce less carbon dioxide Governments offered incentives to motorists to buy diesels and sales increased considerably. Those motorists were literally taken for a ride. Now the damaging effects of diesel cars on health and the foolishness of using them in cities are understood, sales are plummeting. It an unpleasant choice – more using diesel or more using petrol. There is already evidence that the switch back to petrol cars is increasing emissions, a problem highlighted by Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. and climate change appears to be an issue forgotten by some,” says Hawes. “Because diesel cars typically consume less fuel than petrol equivalents, they emit on average less Without modern diesels on the roads, coupled with a slow uptake of alternatively fuelled vehicles, it will be increasingly difficult to meet tough EU targets and deliver shared ambitions on climate change.” Rod Dennis at motoring organisation the RAC reckons motorists are now thoroughly confused about what they should be buying. “Most drivers have little awareness of how polluting their present car, or one they are thinking of leasing or purchasing, really is,” he says. “There is a large job to do in educating drivers about the best type of vehicle for them, in terms of the type of driving they do, their budget and what is best for the environment. “Today, there is no single source of information that allows a driver to look up to what emissions standard their vehicle conforms. Without these basic tools, it will be very difficult to persuade motorists to take more ownership of the emissions for which they are responsible, and therefore more difficult to persuade them to move to a lower emissions vehicle.” Prof Kelly says the government is still dragging its feet on introducing policies that would make dramatic improvements to air quality, and points out that successive reports by the parliamentary environment committee have condemned government inaction. “Despite mounting evidence of the costly health and environmental impacts of air pollution,” said one report in , “we see little evidence of a cohesive cross-government plan to tackle emissions.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) defends the government record. “ Air quality has improved significantly in recent years,” she says. “Nitrogen oxide emissions have fallen by But we recognise there is more to do. That is why we are taking comprehensive action through our ambitious new clean air strategy. By ending the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans by we are also acting faster to tackle air pollution than almost every other major developed economy.” But as critics like to point out, is a long way off, and by then none of the present generation of politicians will be around to be held accountable for meeting – or missing – the target. After Brexit the UK government, rather than the EU commission, will be responsible for legal standards on air pollution in the UK. Could this, as some fear, be an opportunity to relax safeguards and lower safety limits? Defra insists this will not be the case. “The EU (Withdrawal) Act ensures that existing EU environmental law continues to have effect in UK law after exit,” says the spokeswoman, “and the forthcoming environment bill will include provisions to improve air quality.” As that legislation passes through parliament next year, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah hopes to be back in a coroner court trying to prove that air pollution killed her daughter. If she does, it would be a crucial milestone for clean air campaigners, and the government timescale for ending the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles might have to be speeded up. Kelly committee estimates that nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter are responsible for between and premature deaths a year in the UK. If correct, that would make it the number two public health killer after smoking, and a bigger cause of premature death than alcohol and obesity. But these are just numbers, lifeless statistics; Ella, until asthma immobilised her, was a vibrant, sporty, life-loving little girl, which is why a new inquest could change everything. “No one gets ‘Died from air pollution’ on their death certificate,” says Kelly, “and if her death can be solidly linked, it would be a big step forward.” The view from the street I recently took a walk along two of London most polluted streets – Marylebone Road in central London, which according to one recent report has the highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide in Britain, and Brixton Road in south London , another hotspot, notorious for breaching its annual pollution limits within days of the start of each new year. The responses I received when I asked people about the UK “invisible killer” demonstrated that the dangers of air pollution are now clearly understood. “It bothers me hugely that I have to breathe this,” says Peter, who has run a stall selling coffee next to Marylebone Road for six years, “but I’m not in an economic position to be able to do anything about it. This is my own business and I’ve put a lot of money into it. I just have to live with it.” Why not wear a mask? “I’d look like a Millwall fan from the he replies. “It not really going to encourage people to buy any coffee.” Chloe, who lives in a street close to the Marylebone flyover, where the vehicles are backed up and you really can smell the fumes, does intend to do something about it. “I’m living with a friend but I’m going to move away because of the pollution,” she says. “I’m very aware things get dirty quickly around here.” David, a lawyer who is having a cigarette outside Westminster magistrates court, also dislikes the road. “The pollution bothers me enormously,” he says. “It bad in much of London. The idea that there is no escape from polluted air is the thing I like least about living in this city.” On Brixton Road, Antina, who is wearing a mask (though mainly to ward off germs, she says), says her teenage daughter has educated her about the dangers of air pollution. She is with her friend Joe, who works in Brixton. Joe, who is asthmatic and says he sometimes suffers badly from its effects, suggests cheaper tube tickets and pro-bike initiatives to combat the problem. “Air pollution harms everybody,” he says. “We have to look at the long-term effects.” “I went down to Somerset on holiday recently,” says a young woman called Sydney who lives locally. “I found I could breathe a lot better in the country air, and coming back was like being choked.” “I don’t think there enough public pressure on politicians,” says her friend Luka. “We don’t push enough to show this is how much damage we’re doing. It needs to get talked about",2947,/environment/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/22/invisible-killer-how-one-girls-tragic-death-could-change-the-air-pollution-story

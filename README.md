# Guardian sentiment analysis
A program to scrape news stories from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk) for sentiment analysis.  

This was something I wrote a couple years ago to play with a sentiment analysis library ([VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)) and to practice
web scraping and using pandas dataframes.


## Usage
### Scraping the stories
To scrape the stories run: ```python guardian_scraper.py```.  

You can set the number of stories scraped per news theme via the NO_URLS variable and add or remove news themes in the THEMES list.
Scraping 50 stories will take around 1-2 minutes per theme.


### Analysing the results
You can run each analysis separately, or use ```python run_analysis.py``` to run them all. Set the DATAFILE variable to the
output generated by guardian_scraper, or to the example data set in the /data directory. 
The analysis will take a few minutes to run, and generate:  

Violin plots from the sentiment analysis of each theme:

Wordclouds for each theme:

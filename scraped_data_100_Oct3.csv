0,"Hopes have dimmed of finding people alive in the wreckage from the earthquake and tsunami that struck Palu in Indonesia with rescue teams struggling to reach some of the worst hit areas. The death toll rose to almost on Wednesday with hundreds of people unaccounted for. 'Now it too late': anger over Palu long wait for tsunami aid “The death toll is now [and] missing,” said Willem Rampangilei, head of Indonesia national disaster agency. “And there are still a few bodies trapped under the rubble. We don’t know how many. Our priority is still to find and save people.” To add to the woes of Sulawesi island, on Wednesday morning the Soputan Volcano in northern Sulawesi erupted, spewing volcanic ash up to metres into the air. No casualties have been reported and authorities rushed to point out that footage going viral online, showing rivers of red lava consuming houses purported to be from the Soputan crater, was a hoax. “It could be that this earthquake triggered the eruption, but the direct correlation has yet to be seen as there had been an increase in the Mount Soputan activity,” Kasbani, an Indonesian volcanologist who uses only one name, told online news site Tempo. Rescue teams focused their efforts on destroyed buildings in Palu city, such as the Roa Roa hotel, where people were still thought to be buried. Around personnel from the military, the police, national search and rescue agency and the energy and mineral resources department were deployed to the area to assist in aid and rescue efforts and maintain security. Tensions continued to mount in Palu on Wednesday at the lack of clean water and food supplies, with desperate residents ransacking shops for supplies. Police said they had begun making arrests of those caught stealing. On Tuesday six trucks laden with supplies were reportedly looted en route to Palu. However President Joko Widodo insisted that Indonesian authorities were in full control. “There is no such thing as looting,” he said during a visit to Palu. The trickle of aid to harder to reach areas outside of the city of Palu remained particularly slow, frustrating communities who felt they had been ignored or abandoned. Jens Laerke, from the UN humanitarian office, said: “There are still large areas of what might be the worst-affected areas that haven’t been properly reached, but the teams are pushing, they are doing what they can.” What caused the Indonesia tsunami and could lives have been saved? The United Nations humanitarian agency, UNOCHA, said on Monday that people were in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Indonesia has agreed to accept foreign aid for the disaster but the government told foreign rescue teams to “stand down”, insisting they had the disaster under control. The airport remained closed to foreign airlines wishing to transport aid into the area and the vice-president, Jusuf Kalla, said the government had rejected the offer of a hospital ship from the US government. But those on the ground described scenes of hospitals being overwhelmed, people queueing for petrol for hours and devastated areas the village of Wani in Donggala province remaining without help five days after the earthquake hit. “Twelve people in this area haven’t yet been found,” said Wani resident Mohammad Thahir Talib. “In the area to the south, because there hasn’t been an evacuation we don’t know if there are bodies. It possible there are more,” he said. “We feel like we are stepchildren here because all the help is going to Palu,” said Mohamad Taufik, from the town of Donggala, where five of his relatives are still missing. “There are many young children here who are hungry and sick but there is no milk or medicine.”",616,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/indonesia-tsunami-hopes-of-finding-survivors-dwindle
1,"The Dutch public broadcaster has announced that it will change the appearance of the traditional Christmas character Black Pete, whose blackface outfit sparks annual controversy. Black Pete: extreme right appears to stoke Dutch divisions NTR said the character of Zwarte Piet – the helper of Saint Nicholas, or Sinterklaas as he is known in Dutch – would this year only have soot smudges on his face for his official arrival in November. “The NTR respects both tradition and change, but it is our public duty as an independent public broadcaster to reflect these changes in society,” the broadcaster said on Wednesday. “Therefore the Black Petes this year will have soot on their hands and faces because they came through the chimney. “They will have different types of hair and will not be wearing golden earrings.” Black Pete character is usually performed by an adult with a blacked-up face, wearing an afro wig, earrings, gaudy costume and red lips – a costume that has increasingly come under fire for being a racist stereotype. Critics say his Afro hair, black skin, red lips and earrings are a reminder of the era when the Netherlands exploited slaves, notably in Surinam. But many Dutch strongly defend the traditional Black Pete, with the most common explanation being that his face is black because of soot from the chimneys he descends to bring presents to excited children. Black Pete is just a bit of fun for the Netherlands, right? Wrong | Samira bin Sharifu The broadcaster added that “we produce this programme for the whole of the Netherlands and therefore we would like to involve as many people as possible in these changes.” Its decision appeared to trigger the start of what has become an annual debate in the Netherlands over the issue. “Oh boy, I’m not watching,” tweeted Remco Dijkstra, an MP from Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte VVD party, in response to the announcement. Protests – on both sides of the debate – are scheduled this year for the arrival of St Nicholas, which is due on November in Zaanstad, north of Amsterdam, before the festival of Sinterklaas on December when the Dutch traditionally give each other presents.",364,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/dutch-christmas-character-black-pete-to-shed-blackface-for-tv
2,"orrado Nicora is talking about the flyest Vespa in Genoa: his own. For his birthday, the secretary of Vespa Club Genoa decided that a new scooter was just what he needed. It had to be the tangerine GTS , but there was a problem: it was only on sale outside Italy. He was on the verge of shelling out the extra cash for the imported model when he stumbled across one in a Genoa showroom. His face lights up as he recalls the moment, his hands reaching out like Indiana Jones for a sacred idol. “This one – it mine.” Not being able to find a particular Vespa in Genoa – Nicora believes there are only three tangerine GTS here – is weird in a city where the Vespa is king. Fewer people own cars in Genoa than in any other Italian city apart from Venice; there are an estimated motorbikes and scooters in Genoa, among a population of Among them, the aristocrats are the Vespa owners. The creator of the Vespa, Rinaldo Piaggio, was born in Genoa and the original Piaggio factory was in the city Sestri Ponente district. Lambretta, Vespa rival in the retro-scooter stakes, is practically a dirty word. (“No, no, no, no,” says Nicora, when I mention it.) The Vespa, which is now manufactured in Pontedera, Tuscany, quickly became a worldwide ambassador for Italian style. Its elegant swooping chassis symbolised postwar modernity and freedom, and, in later years, a kind of retro connoisseur taste. But the brand seems ageless: total global sales have passed Which makes it even more surprising that Genoa is trying to outlaw them . The city authorities first tried to do so on Vespa anniversary in To curb pollution, they announced that all scooters built before would be banned from entering the city centre between and The uproar was predictable, hitting Twitter first under the hashtag #lamiavespanonsitocca (“Don’t touch my Vespa”). The municipality eventually backed down. We have to make sure that the most polluting engines are no longer in the centre Marco Bucci, mayor But the new mayor, Marco Bucci, has promised to resurrect similar measures. The municipality has not released details of its upcoming transport policy, which is due to be announced later this year, but it will prioritise a transition to electric vehicles, with subsidised electricity for users. Ominously for diehard Vespa riders, Bucci has promised: “We have to make sure that the most polluting engines are no longer in the centre.” Although it seems surprising that Genoa would want to tar its beloved city mascot, scooters have acquired dirty overtones in European policy circles. The two-stroke engine that powered the Vespa to worldwide fame burns a mixture of oil and gasoline, producing as much pollution as four-stroke ones, according to some estimates. This year, Amsterdam banned models from its low-emission zone and, in Paris excluded all motorbikes and scooters from the city centre during the day on weekdays. It is an even bigger issue in many Asian cities, where two-stroke scooters are ubiquitous. Bucci is also keen to project a modern, progressive image for Genoa, a mission made more urgent in the wake of the bridge collapse in August, which killed Bucci, a former pharmaceuticals manager, has “tried to transfer the idea of how to run a company to a city”, says Nicora. “He trying to be smart, to revolutionise Genoa.” It could be that the Vespa is an easy target for Bucci: moped sales are falling, even in Italy . Only were sold in compared with in and there was a drop in EU petrol-scooter registrations between the first quarters of and Scooters – once the height of freewheeling urban elan – have to increasingly prove they are not dragging down modern cities. Seventy years ago, Vespa was the acme of modern metropolitan living. It started becoming an urban icon in when Rinaldo Piaggio son Enrico decided the company should create a form of affordable transport for the masses. An aeronautical engineer, Corradino d’Ascanio, came up with the poised, narrow-waisted design that gave the new machine its name: “wasp” in Italian. The scooter was particularly adapted to scrappy urban conditions and postwar consumers who favoured convenience, says Nick Broomhall, UK spokesman for Piaggio. “You’ve got to imagine what Italy roads were like after the war. Let get a device that light and easy to manoeuvre, and that you can ride without getting dirty, because the engine was totally enclosed.” The Vespa was ... a magical instrument, which I never really desired, because it was beyond every possible desire Umberto Eco Marketed equally at women and men, the Vespa quickly became a symbol of a kind of mobility, freedom, emancipation and romance that is most possible in cities. Umberto Eco, in an essay on Vespa , recalled an unrequited crush who, at the end of a school day, would be swept away by a love rival on a scooter. Both she and the moped represented a kind of platonic ideal. “This is what the Vespa was for me. A magical instrument, which I never really desired, because it was beyond every possible desire,” he wrote. Piaggio put out just of the original Vespa, but by it had already sold Prior to mass TV ownership, Piaggio generated a buzz through the network of Italian Vespa clubs, of which there were by they lined up for organised scooter races, such as the rally with prize money of lira today). Those clubs still proliferate and, though the company no longer controls them, members still receive an insurance discount. Vespas also featured in many films of the time, including Luchino Visconti Bellissima in and Federico Fellini La Dolce Vita in but it was Audrey Hepburn wobbling off with a shriek on a in Roman Holiday that confirmed the Vespa growing aura abroad as a marker of Italian urban chic. The Vespa took on a countercultural spin in the when it was adopted, along with the Lambretta, as a key component of the mod wardrobe: most famously, Sting rides a GS Rally Vespa in his role as Ace Face in Quadrophenia . Since then, the brand retro allure has known no bounds. There are Vespa clubs, roaring out on mod-style rallies in locations such as Jakarta , Johannesburg and Kampala . The Vespa World Day in Celle, Germany, attracted riders from clubs in countries. Vespa World Days, which take place in a different location every year, can be seen as either a huge promotion shindig or the scooter fanatic equivalent of a busman holiday. In Genoa, it not a fashion. We use it. Corrado Nicora In Genoa, though, the Vespa is part of the furniture. Perfectly adapted to nipping in and out of the alleys of the historical centre, it is not the retro fetish object it has become in Milan or Rome, let alone London or New York. “In Genoa, it not a fashion,” says Nicora. “We use it.” Vespas slip seamlessly into the tightly parked ranks of two-wheelers that flank the city streets, lining piazzas and courtyards, and underneath the flyover on Via Aurelia. Everyone uses them: tattooed millennials, bespectacled housewives, grannies riding in tandem. There is none of the free-for-all traffic slaloms you see in other Mediterranean cities such as Marseille; they slot in an orderly fashion into the traffic flow. Vespas seem vital here: public transport coverage is thin in Genoa, with a single, eight-station metro line, and the Ligurian hills, rising steeply up from the port, aren’t bike-friendly. No wonder the locals took up arms to defend their scooters. It was the city three Vespa clubs, along with local motorbike associations, that led the fight to convince the previous mayor to rescind the ban. They used a PowerPoint presentation in the town hall to show that the maligned older models only numbered around and were thus insignificant in polluting terms compared with the cruise ships that docked in the Porto Antico, whose engines ran for days on end. According to their statistics, motorcycles only produced tonnes of nitrogen dioxide in compared with for the port. The whole motorcycle and scooter industry is suffering in that they don’t appeal to younger people Nick Broomhall, Piaggio UK Broomhall goes as far as to suggest that scooters could provide a solution to mounting congestion problems and reduce idling emissions by keeping traffic moving. He cites a study from the Belgian city of Leuven , which found that switching of road users to mopeds would reduce congestion by The innards of scooters are gradually being upgraded for a cleaner era: the first electric Vespa was announced last year and will be available this autumn. Nevertheless, Broomhall admits that Piaggio is fighting to stay relevant in the century. “The motorcycle and scooter industry is suffering in that they don’t appeal to younger people,” he says. “If they have money, they prefer to spend it on a gadget.” 'They are strong and attractive': Vespa Club Uganda – in pictures In Genoa, however, the Vespa still stands for independence, urbanist trends be damned. Bucci is taking a softer line than his predecessor, promising the city Vespa owners “time to adapt”. But he is clear about his priorities. “Our strategy is to favour electric vehicles. With that in mind, two-stroke engines do not have long left.” The local Vespa clubs have said they are ready to resume their fight. Nicora proudly shows off photos of his customised GTS – with a matte-black exhaust, LED headlights and digital display – and waggles his fingers under his chin, the Italian gesture for exasperation. “People talk about globalisation, but you can’t control people.

3,"A Saudi journalist known as one of the country most outspoken critics has gone missing after visiting its consulate in Istanbul, raising fears about his safety. Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi commentator who writes a regular column for the Washington Post, entered the Saudi Arabian diplomatic mission in the Turkish city after midday on Tuesday for a visit relating to filing a divorce before he can remarry. His Turkish fiancee, who waited outside for him for hours on Tuesday, said he had failed to come out and called the police. “I don’t know what happening. I don’t know if he inside or if they took him somewhere else,” she told Reuters by telephone from outside the Saudi mission in Istanbul, where she was waiting for a second day. A spokesperson for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Wednesday said the journalist remained inside the Saudi consulate. Ankara was monitoring the case and had raised the issue with their Saudi Arabian counterparts, the spokesman said, expressing hope that the issue would be resolved. Reuters later quoted a Saudi official as saying that Khashoggi was “not in the consulate nor in Saudi custody”. With more than million followers on Twitter, Khashoggi is a prolific commentator in print and on television. He was famous for interviewing Osama bin Laden several times and also served as a media aide under Prince Turki al-Faisal, when the latter was director general of the Saudi intelligence agency. The crown prince doesn’t listen to Saudis – why would he listen to Theresa May? | Jamal Khashoggi and Robert Lacey He left Saudi Arabia more than a year ago to live in self-imposed exile in the US, where he spoke out against the new leadership of the de facto ruler, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. In one of his articles published last year, he said he had left the country to raise his voice. “To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot,” he wrote. The veteran journalist had previously expressed concerns about his safety. Khashoggi told the Wall Street Journal after leaving Saudi Arabia: “It was becoming so suffocating back at home that I was beginning to fear for myself.” Saudi authorities detained scores of businessmen – including members of the royal family – in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, in what was billed as a campaign against corruption. Among those held in detention was prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who owned al-Arab news channel, an Arabic-language service run by Khashoggi. Alwaleed had been critical of King Salman moves to empower his son, the crown prince. The Washington Post opinions editor, Eli Lopez, said in a statement that the newspaper had been unable to reach Khashoggi and was concerned about his whereabouts. “We are monitoring the situation closely, trying to gather more information. It would be unfair and outrageous if he has been detained for his work as a journalist and commentator,” Lopez said. Jason Rezaian, a commentator for the Washington Post whose imprisonment in Iran drew international attention, wrote in support of his fellow columnist Khashoggi. “Over the past year, Saudi authorities – led by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman – have claimed to be undertaking a process of reform. “Troubling developments from the community of activists inside the country, however, tell a vastly different story. “Those pushing for change – whether they are women rights activists, journalists or ethnic minorities – report being systematically harassed by the authorities.” A US state department spokesperson said they had seen the reports from Istanbul and were “seeking more information at this time”.",601,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/saudi-dissident-jamal-khashoggi-reportedly-missing-consulate-visit-istanbul
4,"Peru supreme court has overturned the pardon of former president Alberto Fujimori and ordered his immediate capture and return to jail. Just nine months after Fujimori was granted a humanitarian pardon, the country supreme court has ruled the former president must complete his jail sentence for authorising death squads, overseeing rampant corruption and vote-rigging. Former President Pedro Pablo Kuczysnki pardoned Fujimori, on humanitarian grounds last Christmas Eve in a move widely seen as a political deal to save himself from impeachment on corruption allegations. 'Act of treason': Fujimori pardon reopens wounds for victims of Peru state terror The move triggered massive street demonstrations and prompted outrage among relatives of victims of human rights abuses during the former strongman rule. In a ruling on Wednesday, Judge Hugo Nuñez said the pardon, which was granted for medical reasons, lacked legal foundation and had been pushed through too quickly. He added that Fujimori, who governed Peru between and should not have been freed as he did not suffer from a terminal illness, which was one of the reasons given for his medical pardon. “This is the saddest day of our lives,” the former president daughter and political heir, Keiko Fujimori told journalists outside her father home in Lima. “A judge in our country took away my father freedom saying because he is not dying, he doesn’t have the right to a humanitarian pardon, and secondly, because there were procedural errors the one who must pay is my father.” She said her father lawyer will appeal the court decision. Alberto Fujimori is the figurehead of the party which dominates Peru congress and a deeply divisive figure in the country. The hard-right populist political movement he began in the continues under the leadership of Keiko Fujimori who commands an absolute majority in Peru legislature. She has twice narrowly lost presidential elections in and the second time by the narrowest of margins to Kuczynski, who resigned in March rather than face impeachment for alleged corruption . “This is revenge,” Carlos Tubino, a congressman for Fuerza Popular, the party led by Keiko Fujimori, told journalists in Peru congress. “They want Fujimori to die in jail for the satisfaction of people who have no humanity in their heart.” Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director for Amnesty International, tweeted that the court had respected the “rights of the victims and their families”. “The humanitarian pardon granted to Fujimori violated the obligations of the state to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for serious human rights crimes,” she added. The pardon was appealed by the families of the victims of two death squad massacres for which Fujimori was sentenced to years in prison in “This ruling re-establishes the right to justice for the families and makes completely clear the illegality of he decision of then president Kuczysnki,” Carlos Rivera, a lawyer at the Legal Defence Institute, told local television. “What the families of the victims have shown that this pardon was not humanitarian but a political pact,” said Marisa Glave, of the leftist Nuevo Peru party. Peruvians remain bitterly divided over Fujimori legacy. His supporters credit him with laying the foundations of the country robust economy and defeating the brutal Maoist Shining Path movement.",532,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/peru-high-court-overturns-pardon-alberto-fujimori
5,"The Nauruan government has refused passports to at least three members of the so-called Nauru who were charged over attending a political rally in despite the court throwing out a criminal case against them. The three people, including a former Nauruan government minister, were all told their applications were rejected on the grounds of “potential for harmful conduct” legislation. The trio wrote to the minister on Wednesday, asking him to explain the decision and detail the concerns he held about them. “We believe the minister needs to give us clarification on what his concerns are,” Mathew Batsiua, a member of the and a former justice minister, told Guardian Australia. “We believe there is no real good reason why we should be stopped for getting access to passports. We can appeal, but we need to know the reasons which led to the decision to decline our passports.” Go Back to Where You Came From&nbsp;Live is ambitious TV. But does it work? Batsiua, Squire Jeremaiah and Joram Joram all received rejection letters citing section of the Passport Act, which allows the refusal of a passport if issuing one would see that person likely to engage in conduct which might: prejudice the security of Nauru or a foreign country endanger the health or physical safety of another person constitute a serious offence against this act constitute a prescribed serious offence against another act The long-running saga stems from a protest in objecting to the suspension of members of parliament for speaking to the media and criticising the government expulsion of the chief justice. The Nauru – which also included a former Nauruan president – were charged with public order offences but last month the Australian trial judge, Judge Geoffrey Muecke, ordered a permanent stay in proceedings, saying the government had already decided the group was guilty and would do whatever it could, at any cost, to convict and jail them. Three of the members had pleaded guilty and were appealing increases of up to to their sentences when the Nauruan government quietly severed a treaty that enshrined Australia high court as its highest appeals court. Muecke said the actions of the Nauru government – and in particular those of the justice minister, David Adeang – were “a shameful affront to the rule of law ”. “The judgment was quite clear and concise, and comprehensive as well, that the charges against us cannot proceed on the grounds that we wouldn’t get a fair trial,” Batsiua said. However the Nauruan government announced two days after the ruling that it would be appealing, which it said was “wrong in law and needed to be corrected by an appeal”. Australia spent fighting requests for urgent medical transfers of asylum seekers It said Muecke ruling did not determine guilt or innocence. Batsiua said that, other than no longer having to go to court, little had changed for the group since the decision. “We still can’t access work … there seems to be ongoing repercussions with the blacklist,” he said. “I had a school reunion I was intending to attend but won’t get to now, and I’ve got two kids studying in country Victoria and was hoping to visit them.” Batsiua said there was suspicion of ongoing persecution of the Nauru and the refusal of the passports was “in line with that kind of attitude”. “But the laws are there and we’ve got appeal rights,” he said. “We’ve asked [the minister] to reply to it as soon as possible … so hopefully he responds within a few days.” The case is believed to have been the motivation behind a number of legislative changes, including the introduction of sweeping new contempt of court laws , and the removal of the presumption of bail for contempt of court – which only otherwise applied to charges of murder and treason. The Nauru Department of Justice and Border Control could not be reached for comment.",652,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/04/nauru-19-at-least-three-members-denied-passports-despite-court-throwing-out-case
6,"The refusal of Macedonia voters to endorse a change in their country name seems, at first glance, to be a matter of purely local interest. But the result of Sunday referendum will be widely seen as a significant victory for Vladimir Putin, a setback for the EU and Nato, and another disturbing example of Russia ability and willingness to influence the democratic process in western countries. Western officials warned before the vote that Moscow was trying to depress turnout in the referendum in order to invalidate the outcome. In the event, more than of those voting backed the name change. But turnout was about short of the required to make the decision binding on parliament. Zoran Zaev, Macedonia prime minister, has vowed to press ahead , but will face stiff opposition from nationalists. Macedonia facing crisis after name change referendum hit by low turnout Increased instability and division suit Russia game plan, according to western analysts. If the referendum had been successful, it would have resolved a dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia route to EU and Nato membership. As elsewhere in the western Balkans, notably Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro, Moscow is determined to prevent further expansion of western influence . For students of the US presidential election, Russia methods in Macedonia look highly familiar. Disinformation campaigns and “fake news”, cyberwarfare and hacking, phoney Facebook and Twitter accounts and secret cash payments – the modern equivalent of communist-era “red gold” – are all alleged to have been used. Russia denies interfering. But western diplomats claimed last month that new posts a day were appearing on Facebook encouraging a referendum boycott. Postings asked “are you going to let Albanians change your name?” – a blatant attempt to stoke tensions with majority-Slav Macedonia ethnic Albanian minority. In one incident, football supporters opposed to the name change fought police in Skopje. Some later admitted they had been paid to cause trouble by shadowy figures. A photograph was circulated on social media showing the bruised face of a popular singer. It falsely claimed she had been beaten by police. Zaev said at one point he had received numerous reports that Greek businessmen “sympathetic to the Russian cause” had paid rightwing nationalist groups as much as to commit acts of violence. He was supported by James Mattis, the US defence secretary, who declared on a visit to Skopje that there was “no doubt they [Russia] have transferred money and are conducting broader influence campaigns”. Mattis attempt to bolster the yes vote, backed by in US congressional funding, were complemented by visits by Angela Merkel, Germany chancellor, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, and Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief. Britain Foreign Office reportedly provided referendum funds. All sought to assure Macedonians their future security and prosperity were best served by closer integration with the west. But they were out-thought, outspent and outmanoeuvred by Moscow. Mattis linked events in Macedonia to past Russian interference in votes in the US, the UK and Europe . “We do not want to see Russia doing [in Macedonia] what they have tried to do in so many other countries,” he said. Similarly, Stoltenberg said: “We have seen Russia trying to interfere in democratic political processes in this region for many years.” Russia meddling extended to northern Greece, where four diplomats were expelled in July for trying to inflame anti-Macedonian sentiment in Thessaloniki. In Moscow was accused of trying to mount a coup in Montenegro to prevent it from joining Nato. As elsewhere in Europe, Russia influence campaign in Macedonia exploited and complemented rightwing nationalist-populist narratives based on notions of identity, race and the perceived threat of an overbearing EU. And it remains unclear whether Moscow actions tipped the balance. The paradox is that, whatever their country is called, a large majority of Macedonians support EU and Nato membership, according to a recent survey. That prospect has receded, at least for now. In the continuing Europe-wide contest for power and influence, Russia just scored again.",666,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/01/result-of-macedonia-referendum-is-another-victory-for-russia
7,"he civil war in Yemen is one of those obscure conflicts that feels as though it has been going on for ever. In the space of little more than three years, the conflict has become what the UN and aid agencies agree is the world worst man-made humanitarian disaster, with civilians killed or wounded, million people facing famine, a nation torn apart and an economy destroyed. The killing of children, hit by missiles and shells smashing into their homes and schools or stricken by disease and malnutrition, has come to symbolise Yemen war. The UN latest Children and Armed Conflict report found that children were killed or maimed in Just over half died in air attacks by the western-backed, pro-government coalition, and many others at the hands of Houthi rebels. Yet perhaps most extraordinary, and dismaying, is the counter-productive response of the governments principally concerned. There has been intervention aplenty since – by the Saudis, the UAE, Iran, the US and the UK – but their actions have served to inflame the conflict, not extinguish it. In the very limited discussions about Yemen among national leaders at the UN last week, it was clear the conflict is getting worse, not better. The collapse in Geneva of the latest UN-sponsored peace talks could trigger the war bloodiest chapter yet August was the most violent month so far this year, with nearly people killed in nine days, according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC). There has been a spike in civilian deaths in the last four months, and this rate of attrition is expected to rise further amid the Saudi-led, pro-government coalition resumed offensive on the port of Hodeidah. Overall, since the coalition has launched airstrikes, one-third of which are said to have hit non-military targets. “The world needs a wake-up call to the situation in Yemen,” said David Miliband, the former UK foreign secretary and IRC president, after visiting this month. “With more than million people in need of aid, of the population lacking access to basic healthcare and nearly half lacking access to clean drinking water … there is reason enough to believe the worst is yet to come.” Miliband assessment that no side was winning the war, and his call for an immediate ceasefire, has been echoed by other agencies. “Yemen is a disaster and I don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel right now,” David Beasley, director of the World Food Programme, said last week. Access for relief agencies was a particular problem, he added, accusing the Iranian-backed Houthis of “ breaking every human principle imaginable ”, including impeding food deliveries. In a commentary published by the International Crisis Group, Yemen consultant Peter Salisbury warned that the collapse in Geneva earlier this month of the latest UN-sponsored peace talks could trigger the war bloodiest chapter yet . “An avoidable tragedy now looks inevitable absent swift and forceful intervention by UN security council member states, the US in particular,” Salisbury wrote. Hopes that Saudi Arabia and the UAE, currently intensifying military operations, will voluntarily desist appear forlorn. Nor is there any indication that Iran, which believes it has the upper hand and views Yemen as part of a region-wide struggle with the Sunni Arab monarchies of the Gulf, is ready to back off. Donald Trump assertion at the UN that Tehran was causing “havoc and slaughter” in Syria and Yemen, and his praise for Saudi leaders, suggests escalation is more probable. Nor is there much likelihood that a Brexit-obsessed Britain, despite harsh domestic criticism of its military assistance in planning airstrikes and its arms sales to the Saudi regime, will act. France, another UN security council permanent member, is similarly compromised by prior support for the coalition and lucrative arms sales. Like the US and UK, it reportedly has special forces on the ground , engaged in counter-terrorism operations against Islamist extremists. All of which leaves one possible ray of light for the suffering Yemenis. Last week more than members of the US House of Representatives backed a bipartisan resolution invoking the War Powers Act, declaring that Congress never authorised US support for the coalition in Yemen, as it is legally bound to do under the act, and directing Trump to withdraw all American military personnel. Action is also pending in the US Senate , where Bob Menendez – the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee – is blocking a arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. “Widespread destruction and disease [are] contributing to the world worst humanitarian crisis. US-fuelled planes continue to drop US-made bombs on innocent victims,” said Democrat Ro Khanna, the House resolution lead sponsor. A showdown vote is expected after November elections. Both moves are certain to be fiercely opposed by the Trump administration, which argues its military assistance and expertise reduces the number of civilian deaths. But both reflect growing public abhorrence at a series of atrocities, including a horrific bus bombing that killed dozens of children last month, which could implicate the US government and personnel in war crimes. “The actions of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen are fast approaching the level of crimes against humanity,” said Democrat Jim McGovern. “The US must send a clear and unambiguous message to Saudi Arabia – their actions are unacceptable to the international community and will not be tolerated.”",889,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/yemen-finds-chance-of-hope-on-capitol-hill-house-senate

If Kavanaugh was confirmed after that performance, the credibility of the supreme court, the credibility of America, would surely be undermined. There was no way it could happen. Well, it looks like I completely underestimated the pull of patriarchy in America. If you’re a rich, white guy with powerful friends it seems you can get away with anything. Kavanaugh hasn’t been confirmed yet, but the Wall Street Journal editorial board has called for him to be confirmed and Republicans are rallying around him. It looking increasingly likely he’ll be given a lifelong appointment to impose his will on America, no matter how women feel about it. But Republicans shouldn’t expect women to accept this without a fight. We will march, we will strike, we will run for office. We have had enough: patriarchy is on borrowed time. How to prove you didn’t sexually assault anyone: the Brett Kavanaugh playbook Sorry to keep on about Kavanaugh, but the entire episode really has been a case study in rape culture. Let review, shall we? Here are five defenses that Kavanaugh, a supposed genius in law, actually thought were credible. Say you were a virgin. In an interview with Fox News that aired on Monday, Kavanaugh stated, unprompted, he was a virgin for years after high school. If you think, as Kavanaugh appears to, that being a virgin means you can’t be guilty of sexual assault, then you have no right to be a judge in the first place, let alone on the supreme court. Use your daughter as a political pawn. In his testimony on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he meant no ill will to his accuser and, in fact, his daughter wanted to pray for Ford. He choked up after delivering this anecdote. I’d like to think in shame, but I’m not sure he is capable of feeling anything other than self-pity and entitlement. Dig out a calendar from Look, it doesn’t say “attempted to rape someone tonight on it”! Clear sign of innocence there. Reiterate how much you like beer. During the Thursday hearing Kavanaugh mentioned he liked beer around times. He even asked a senator if they liked drinking beer, too. Can you imagine a woman telling a Senate judiciary committee how much she enjoyed drinking? She’d immediately be characterized as an irresponsible slut who deserved anything that happened to her. When men get drunk, it a whole different story. Convince more than women you know to get on stage in support. If you’ve been nice to one woman, it stands to reason that you can’t have sexually assaulted another one, right? That supreme court justice thinking right there. 'Bill Cosby took my spirit and crushed it': Andrea Constand speaks out on sexual assault Now for some good news from other supreme courts around the world On October, the UK supreme court will have a majority of female judges decide a case for the first time in its history. India supreme court has ruled adultery is no longer a crime . The court ruled that the colonial-era law, which criminalized a woman having an extramarital sexual relationship without her husband consent, was archaic and discriminated against women. “It is time to say husband is not the master,” said the chief justice, Dipak Misra. India supreme court seems to be on a roll. It has also ruled that women can no longer be banned from Sabarimala temple , which is one of the holiest for Hindus. Before this ruling, women of a menstruating age (which was defined as were barred from entering the temple in Kerala. And let not forget – Bill Cosby is finally behind bars On Tuesday, Cosby was sentenced to three to years for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home years ago. It took decades for justice to be served, but as attorney Gloria Allred, who represents several women who say they were assaulted by Cosby, said: “We’re glad that judgment day has finally come.” Kavanaugh, I hope you’re paying attention.",850,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/kavanaugh-ford-hearing-protest-patriarchy-borrowed-time
9,"uick – there not a lot of left, so it time to start thinking about next year calendar. The Cliff Richard Official Calendar, obviously, like every year since the beginning of time. No wonder he has already sold more than of them. And yet offering is a bit, well, meh: Cliff holding a mic in front of a splodge of colours; Cliff playing the guitar in front of an only very slightly different splodge; another mic, guitar, splodge ... Maybe he was so busy suing the BBC, he took his eye off the calendar. No animals to be seen, as in or even one with his top off, as in or Both of which you would get if you went for an alternative senior sex symbol official calendar next year. Actually, not so senior: at he is years younger than Cliff. Here are some of the best months from the Vladimir Putin Official Calendar January We’re not going on a Summer Holiday – they’re for wimps. Here, the Russian president takes an unflinching winter dip (pictured) in the icy waters of Lake Seliger. Not only younger than Cliff, but much, much harder. However, like Cliff, a man of God: this is during Epiphany – witness the onlooking religious dudes with big crosses. Plus Vladimir has two pairs of furry boots. Do not mess with this man. He doesn’t sue the state broadcaster – he runs it. June Aaaah! A Bulgarian shepherd dog, a gift from Bulgarian president Boyko Boris, to thank Putin for building a dirty great gas pipeline across his country. For the Russian, it an opportunity to show a softer side. Hey, Cliff doesn’t have a monopoly on cuddly, you know. Look at the eyes, though – Vladimir are still steely (but quite sexy, no?). And the dog terrified. He knows one wrong move and he just another pair of furry boots. July And he can ride a bike, without stabilizers. A proper man one, too, a rugged mountain bike with knobbly tyres, even on the road. And no helmet, note – helmets are for wimps, like double-decker buses and summer holidays. Dark glasses, of course; you can take the man out of the KGB but ... etc. Highlights from other months include: more fur (not dog, hopefully), horses, military, statesman, regular man, definitely man, all man.

10,"One of the world most popular beaches, made famous by the film The Beach, starring Leonardo DiCaprio , is to be closed indefinitely to allow it to recover from the damage caused by millions of tourists. The golden sands and crystal blue water of Maya Bay, ringed by cliffs on Ko Phi Phi Leh island, has become one of Thailand most-visited tourist destinations since it shot to fame as the movie location. The small beach has sustained extensive environmental damage in recent years, receiving up to tourists and boats a day. Can a tourist ban save DiCaprio coral paradise from destruction? Thai authorities announced they would be temporarily closing the bay from June, but have now extended the planned four-month closure to at least a year, due to the extent of the destruction caused by the thousands of day-trippers. Thanks to pollution from litter, boats and sun cream, it is estimated that more than of the coral around Maya Bay has been destroyed. Songtam Suksawang, the director of the national parks department, said: “We have evaluated each month and found out that the ecological system was seriously destroyed from tourism of up to people daily. “It very difficult to remedy and rehabilitate because its beach was completely destroyed as well the plants which cover it,” he said, adding that it was “impossible” for recovery to occur in the allotted time. Despite evidence of the mounting damage to Maya Bay, for years, Thai authorities had been reluctant to shut it, because the location generates about million baht in revenue a year. However, a royal gazette published on October by Thailand department of national parks, wildlife and plant conservation announced the restrictions on tourism would not be lifted until the ecosystem “fully recovers to a normal situation”. The news will come as a relief to local environmental campaigners, who had said a four-month closure was not nearly enough. Coral only grows about half a centimetre a year, so it will take years for the reef to be fully restored. The Maya Bay park chief, Worapoj Lomlim, said the parks agency and others had already rehabilitated coral reefs in the bay by planting more than corals, and would keep expanding the project. Countries across the region from the Philippines to Indonesia are waking up to the problems that can be caused by excessive tourism. In April, the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, announced a six-month closure of the Boracay beach resort, calling the destination a “cesspool” . Indonesia declared a “garbage emergency” last year along a stretch of the island of Bali, after coastal pollution was highlighted in a viral video that showed a diver swimming through water full of rubbish.",447,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/thailand-bay-made-famous-by-the-beach-closed-indefinitely
11,"“I’m getting rid of my name,” said Karaca Satılmış, an actor from Istanbul. “It has held me back professionally.” Satılmış means “sold”, and, to Turkish speakers, it is very amusing. The doesn’t understand why his grandfather chose it. In Turkey , many people only took on surnames in as part of “Turkicisation” reforms designed to create a unified nation state. Citizens were formally required to adopt last names, and many chose names that now seem ridiculous, such as Testicle, Jackal and Naked. But at the end of last year, Turks were pleasantly surprised by a government announcement that in a one-off window in the civil registry would cut red tape to make it easier for people to change misspelled or embarrassing names. Since January, more than people have applied to get rid of names their ancestors chose that future generations went on to find inappropriate. As the end of the year approaches, the interior ministry says applications are flying in. While the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was gifted his last name – “father of the Turks” – by parliament, not all of his countrymen took the opportunity to give themselves such noble monikers. Like Satılmış’ grandfather, other people with a sense of humour called themselves everything from animal names to Aptal (stupid), Donsuz (no underwear) and Tasak (testicle). Generations later, the trend persists. Rahmi is a name derived from the word for “merciful” but can also mean “womb”, meaning a prominent cleric in Istanbul today, Prof Rahmi Yaran, is jokily referred to as “Womb Slasher”. I won’t miss my old name Karaca Satılmış, actor from Istanbul In the same city you can can also employ the services of a lawyer called Güven Kurtul. Güven means “trust”, while his surname means “to get rid of”. Changing a name in Turkey or even rectifying a birth certificate used to involve lengthy and expensive court procedures, but in the window that will close next year, the interior ministry is allowing people to apply directly to local civil registry offices instead. A total of people have applied to change their first name, usually to correct misspellings – amending the woman name “Rabiye” to “Rabia” is the most popular request, followed by the male name “Ümit”, alternatively spelled “Ümüt”. The majority of requests – to date – are to change odd family names. Satılmış (sold), along with Koyun (sheep), Çakal (jackal) and Deli (crazy), are the most common surnames to go, although requests have also been made to get rid of Çıplak (naked), Dana (calf), Kör (blind) and Ördek (duck). Satılmış is paying the civil registry office a visit on Friday. He has decided his new name will be Gokdeniz – which poetically translates as “sky sea”. No one else in his family is changing their name, he said, but they understand his decision. “I won’t miss my old name,” he said. “I would never give my own children a name like that.” Additional reporting by Gokce Saracoglu",497,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/jackal-and-testicle-turkey-makes-it-easier-for-people-to-change-names

In the face of economic benefits, I should not lose my restraint and forsake administrative procedures that lead to violations of the law.” “Without the [Communist] party and the state good policies, without the love from the people, there would be no Fan Bingbing,” she wrote in her first statement for months.

13,"The French president, Emmanuel Macron , was struggling to contain a fresh crisis after the resignation of one of his earliest and closest backers, the interior minister, Gérard Collomb. Collomb departure, which leaves the French government in a state of flux, follows the resignation of the popular environment minister Nicolas Hulot and just as Macron is facing falling approval ratings and a continuing controversy over an Élysée security official who was filmed assaulting people on the edge of a demonstration. Collomb, a former mayor of Lyon who had been one of Macron most loyal allies, left the government after an extraordinary stand-off with the president, who at first refused to let him go but then announced his departure in the early hours of the morning. Macron prime minister, Edouard Philippe, was hastily forced to take on the interior minister national security duties on Wednesday in addition to his prime ministerial role. Officially, Collomb reason for leaving was that he wants to run again for his old job as mayor of Lyon in the next local elections. But Collomb – who once said he and Macron were like father and son – had also made public warnings about the danger of Macron becoming cut-off from citizens. He was reportedly angry at the damaging scandal surrounding Alexandre Benalla , a Macron security official who was filmed beating two people on the edge of a protest in May. Collomb dramatic departure comes at a difficult moment for Macron. The young centrist who has vowed to “repair” a divided France by liberalising the economy, overhauling welfare and labour laws and reinventing the political class has in recent months seen his popularity rating drop to about Trump poll ratings are better than Macron, after a year. Why? | Christophe Guilluy The pro-business president has struggled to rid himself of the label “president of the rich”, seen as acting more in the interest of high-earners than poor families. He has also been accused of being arrogant and aloof, particularly in his dealings with the public. In one recent incident , Macron told an unemployed gardener he could find him a job “by crossing the road”. The comment was seen to imply that, in a country of mass unemployment, those without a job just weren’t trying hard enough. Collomb pointedly and publicly warned Macron about this via the media this month. Asked on TV why the president approval ratings had fallen, he said it was perhaps due to a “lack of humility” in the administration, warned against “hubris” and said Macron repeated use of expressions such as the English-language “start-up nation” were creating a gulf with ordinary citizens. Collomb later implied to a group of journalists at a lunch that Macron was isolated and did not take ” advice. He said: “Very few of us can still talk to [Macron].” He added: “Soon he won’t put up with me any more. But if we all bow down before him he’ll end up isolated.” Collomb resignation so soon after Hulot stormed out saying Macron was not doing enough to fight climate change, is also a personal blow to the president. Collomb, who was mayor of Lyon for years and a stalwart of local politics, was one of the first political heavyweights to rally behind Macron outsider bid for president in bringing an important regional support base . During the presidential campaign, Collomb often travelled around tiny halls in working-class neighbourhoods talking about his life as the son of a factory worker and cleaning lady, saying Macron, a former banker, would transform the country. He wept with apparent emotion at Macron presidential inaugurationin But their relationship reportedly soured this summer over the scandal surrounding Benalla . Benalla, who worked for Macron at the Élysée, was filmed illegally dressed as a police officer, assaulting two people on the edge of a Paris protest in May and is under police investigation. A vast political scandal blew up when it emerged that senior officials knew about Benalla actions. Appearing at a parliamentary inquiry, Collomb had pointed blame at Macron office, saying it was their responsibility to report the incident to prosecutors. The job of interior minister — responsible for policing and immigration — is a crucial senior position in government. Collomb, who had pushed through a controversial hardline immigration policy and had been criticised for not going far enough in reforming local policing, warned as he left that the government must do more to solve the problem of insecurity in poorer neighbourhoods that he said were becoming dominated by drug-dealers and extremists. Independent of his dropping approval ratings, Macron maintains a strong parliament majority that allows him to push through his policy changes unhindered by the political opposition, which remains fragmented. But his public image and support are important if he is to succeed in the “transformation” he is promising for France. Collomb is the third minister to step down in two months. Hulot , the high-profile environment minister and former TV presenter, left without warning, saying he was exasperated with the lack of commitment to environmental issues. The popular sports minster, Laura Flessel, left shortly after, saying it was for “personal reasons”.",861,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/emmanuel-macron-nudged-nearer-crisis-after-ex-loyalist-gerard-collomb-quits
14,"“He covered my mouth with his hand and introduced his penis. I thought my last hour had arrived. I had the feeling my stomach was turning.” These are not the words of a woman testifying as part of the #MeToo movement , and they are not the words of Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against the US supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last week – although the hand over the mouth, if not the reference to the penis, mirror her words. (Kavanaugh denies the allegations.) This is, instead, the experience of a young woman as recounted by the French feminist and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in her classic The Second Sex. I took that book down from the shelf about a month ago; it had sat there, untouched, for years. How many times had I pretended to have read it, nodding knowingly when someone mentioned it at a dinner party, or in a seminar at the Swedish university where I work? A year after the first revelations about the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, I wanted to to sit down and read about women experiences, to stay silent for a while, and hopefully learn something. It has been painful to listen to the stories of systematic sexual abuse that have emerged as a result of the #MeToo movement, and also an education; it has forced me to see things I had failed to see in the past. Before, I knew sexual assaults were endemic, but I didn’t realise they were this endemic. I also understood that the blame is often put on the victim. But I had never really seen this, not in such a concrete and shockingly visible way. It has been a late awakening and, over the course of the year, a couple of overdue questions emerged: what can men do to show solidarity with women, and what can we do to address a culture of toxic masculinity and begin examining ourselves? There is clearly more than one way to do this. The journalist Richard Godwin has described in the Guardian how, in his quest to examine modern manhood, he found groups where men were doing “breathing exercises, talking about their fathers, pretending to be tigers, leaning in on one another, working out which Jungian archetype we vibed with, and trying to articulate why we all felt so defensive and angry and misunderstood so much of the time”. I opted for a quieter approach, following the advice that, to show solidarity with the movement, you could begin by seriously listening to women. So I decided to spend the month leading up to the first anniversary of the Weinstein revelations reading some feminist classics, which, for inexplicable reasons, I had never got round to. I’m sure there are embarrassing and unflattering underlying reasons for this omission, but I’m not sure what they are. Perhaps it was as depressingly simple as the fact that the works of (white) male authors had always been closer to hand – through reading lists and book reviews and recommendations – than the works of (black) feminist writers. With the help of two editors from this newspaper, a list of books was compiled – far from comprehensive, but including some of the most influential feminist works of the last few centuries. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft, The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir, The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan, The Female Eunuch, Germaine Greer, Woman Hating, Andrea Dworkin, Women, Race and Class, Angela Davis, Sister Outsider, Audre Lorde, Gender Trouble, Judith Butler, Feminism Is for Everybody, bell hooks, Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg, Men Explain Things to Me, Rebecca Solnit, Bad Feminist, Roxane Gay, We Should All Be Feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, In early September, I started reading. Halfway through De Beauvoir The Second Sex, I came across a passage that seemed to sum up the shocking insight of #MeToo. De Beauvoir writes that almost all young women, including what she calls “well-protected” ones, have been exposed to “regrettable incidents”, which, in conventional circles, are “hushed up by common agreement”. This reminded me of last autumn, and the experience of watching the evening news with my wife and eight-year-old daughter as the welter of #MeToo allegations began. The news anchor read out some of the testimonies that had been shared on social media. Usually, when horrible things are reported, we could, as a well-protected family, who previously lived in Wales, now in Sweden, calm my daughter down by saying that these things hardly ever happen in our neighbourhood. But we couldn’t do that now. These regrettable incidents could not be hushed up by common agreement. De Beauvoir tells the story in her book of a young girl, no more than years old, who is molested by her grandfather. She cannot find the courage to tell her parents. De Beauvoir writes: “Such incidents are usually endured in silence for the little girl because of the shame they cause. Moreover, if she does reveal them to her parents, their reaction is often to reprimand her. ‘Don’t say such stupid things … you’ve got an evil mind.’” I remember reading the detailed allegations against Jean-Claude Arnault, the influential cultural figure who is married to one of the members of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel prize; he used to casually call himself the academy member. In an article published in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper, women came forward to tell their stories. In graphic detail, they described instances of abuse and rape, and like Weinstein, Arnault was accused of exploiting his power to threaten and blackmail women. He was alleged to have targeted, in particular, those who were weak, vulnerable and “damaged”. On Monday, he was convicted of one count of rape and sentenced to two years in prison. The other cases were dropped for lack of evidence or because they had exceeded the statute of limitations. Only four of the women who testified against him showed their faces. They were the ones who had rejected him outright when he had tried to grope them in bars and elsewhere. Never before had I quite grasped the shame of being the victim as I did when reading this line, from one of the women who had been raped and did not show her face: “I was ashamed I was one of those he chose as victim, to be one of the ‘damaged’ women.” Worse than simply being the victim, he had chosen her as his victim, because she was “damaged” and too weak to say no. I had known, for a long time, that blame is casually ascribed to women who are attacked. I had known this, in theory, as an abstraction. I wonder why #MeToo had to happen for this to stop being an abstraction to me. This story has, after all, been told a thousand times before. It was there, in large print, in the books I read throughout September. I mean, is it possible to read the following story, from Gay Bad Feminist, and still think of shame as an abstraction? She writes about an girl who was raped by a group of boys and men in Texas, and the fact that the New York Times chose to headline their story Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town – as if we should feel sorry for the town and the boys. “It was an girl whose body was ripped apart, not a town,” Gay writes. “It was an girl life that was ripped apart, not the lives of the men who raped her.” A few weeks after the allegations against Weinstein began emerging, a liberal columnist in Sweden wrote that we need to distinguish between real victims and fake victims, claiming that, if all women were as thick-skinned as his daughter, there would be no #MeToo. The problem, he wrote, was that too many women want to assume the role of victims. Their problem is that they don’t know how to say no and to stand their ground. “It never crossed my mind to say no or that I should say no, that I could say no,” writes Gay. When she was a boy she thought was her boyfriend started pressuring her to have sex. One day they were riding their bikes in the woods. She didn’t know that his friends were waiting for them by an abandoned hunting cabin. The boy pushed her to the ground and took her clothes off. She was raped by the group, who kept her there for hours. “I felt fear but I didn’t know how to say no.” After she was raped, Gay didn’t say a word to anyone. She didn’t want to get into trouble. “I was a good girl, so that what I did.” In class the next day, one of the boys leaned towards her and said: “You’re a slut.” A few days after the liberal columnist said women should be more like his daughter, hundreds of Swedish women, all actors, came together under the hashtag #SilenceAction, publishing a long series of detailed accounts of brutal sexual assault. Here is one of the many testimonies. In a hotel, after a party, a woman is on her way into her room. A man – a world-famous actor – follows her. He pushes her to the floor and throws himself on top of her. “Now he’ll rape me,” she remembers thinking. I wanted to ask the liberal columnist: how would your thick-skinned daughter deal with that? Before #MeToo, I had not really understood the connection between power and sexual abuse. I had seen it, of course. But again, only really in theory, as an abstraction. In Men Explain Things to Me, Solnit writes that she surprised herself once when she began an essay by recounting what was, ostensibly, a funny incident – a man refusing to be interrupted while explaining, in great detail, the content of a book she had actually authored. That same essay ended in her writing about rape and murder. These incidents are situated on a continuum, she argues, which stretches from “minor social misery to violent silencing and death”. “Dead men don’t rape”, read a poster that used to hang over Dworkin desk. By the time I’d read a third of the books on the list, I didn’t blame her. In the acerbic pages of Woman Hating, Dworkin writes that, as a woman, you have to ask yourself a number of pressing questions: “Why everywhere the oppression of women throughout recorded history? How could the Inquisitors torture and burn women as witches? How could men idealise the bound feet of crippled women? How and why?” There were books on my list that were not quite as brutal; books less concerned with rape and sexual oppression than with the cultural pressure on women and how to be a woman. At the end of Wollstonecraft A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, she sets out a future “experiment”, by which women would share with men “the advantages of education and government”. In The Female Eunuch, Greer argues that women need to stop seeing themselves as wives and mothers because, confined to these roles, their “horizon shrinks to the house, the shopping centre and the telly”. By Sandberg, the chief operating officer at Facebook, was writing from a business perspective about the need for more women in leadership roles. Her advice to women, expressed in the title of her book, is to lean in – to do what you would do if you weren’t afraid. I nodded my way through these books, recalling the discussions that started at my university about a year ago when, emboldened by what seemed like a revolutionary moment, we discussed a range of radical ideas to facilitate the career possibilities for women, from offering significant research time to women to recruiting women to senior academic positions. One year later, these initiatives have boiled down to a not-so-radical mentoring programme. If these books were familiar, written from a predominantly white, privileged perspective, the next titles were not. Davis begins Women , Race and Class by describing the life of the female slave. Davis notes that, while white women of the abolitionist movement spoke out on behalf of black women, they were unable to grasp the slave woman condition, because the black woman, through her experience of hard work, rape, flogging and resistance, had developed traits that set her apart from the white woman. The black woman, like working-class women, worked until they could work no more. They could only dream of the life of the white housewives. One of the problems with the women movement, Lorde writes in Sister Outsider, is that “white women focus upon their oppression as women and ignore differences of race, sexual preference, class and age”. As a consequence, “women of colour become ‘other’, the outsider”. As I finished the last book, I was thinking about all the men – and many women – who refuse to call themselves feminists. The writer bell hooks says that whenever she introduces herself as a feminist, people respond that feminists are lesbians who hate men and want to make life miserable for white men. When she then asks them about the feminist books they’ve read, they go silent. We need to “create a mass-based educational movement to teach everyone about feminism”, hooks writes in Feminism Is for Everybody, and I can’t stop thinking that this is what #MeToo is. Sure, #MeToo is many things, and some feminists, including Greer, have openly criticised the movement. It has been suggested that many of the incidents are too minor to warrant serious attention, and that women should be better at saying no and reacting immediately if assaulted. I’m reminded of this when I speak to a female friend, a few days before finishing this article. When she says she is surprised to learn I am “pro-#MeToo”, I find myself responding defensively, assuring her that I do recognise some unfortunate potential side-effects. As if to avoid the broader questions of #MeToo and feminism, we end up discussing the tragic case of a man who killed himself after allegations of sexual abuse that later proved false. A year after the first Weinstein allegations, it could be tempting to look back and focus only on examples of where #MeToo went wrong. But we need to remember why the movement, first started by the civil rights activist Tarana Burke in had to take the form it did. It is not as if these stories are new. They just hadn’t been heard properly. And that was one of the most uncomfortable insights from reading these books: that the stories of sexual abuse that emerged last year had been there all along, for centuries. They just hadn’t been discussed, publicly, in the way they have now. A year ago, in the Guardian, the writer Emily Reynolds asked what men could do to examine themselves and show solidarity with the movement; she advised men to ask women questions and start listening. I’m sure there is much to be learned from going on a man camp and discussing masculinity with other men, but I believe the simple advice from Reynolds is potentially more powerful: ask, read, listen, widen your perspective, call your own perspectives into question. Only of Britons consider themselves feminists , according to a Fawcett Society survey, which seems strange to me after reading these books, because the definitions I come across are open, simple, obvious – such as wanting to end sexism or supporting the “social, political and economic equality of the sexes”. In We Should All Be Feminists, the Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writes that when she started describing herself as a feminist, she was told feminists were angry, so she called herself a Happy Feminist. Then she was told that feminism was unAfrican, so she called herself a Happy African Feminist. She continued to make amendments until, at some point, she was a “Happy African Feminist Who Does Not Hate Men and Who Likes to Wear Lip Gloss and High Heels for Herself and Not for Men”. We hold feminism to an unreasonable standard, Gay writes, as though both feminists and feminism must be flawless. She says she is not very well versed in feminist history. She has a wardrobe full of shoes and bags. She listens to sexist rap and reads Vogue. But so what? She is full of contradictions, like everyone else. “I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all,” she writes, and on reading this line, I see an opening, an invitation to me and all the other men who wish to be supportive. I think: if she can be a feminist, then maybe we can, too. Even though, of course, I’m sure I’ll be a much worse feminist than she is.

15,"Italy populist government will cut its budget deficit targets from after investors sold off Italian assets and European Union ministers criticised its plans to jack up spending next year. The ruling coalition last week said it planned to run a deficit of of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, tripling the previous government target. It also said that the deficit would stay at that level through The announcement unnerved markets and prompted criticism from European commission officials but the Five Star Movement leader, Luigi Di Maio, was defiant on Tuesday, pledging not to backtrack “by a millimetre”. However, government sources told Reuters on Wednesday the aim now was to reduce the deficit and to no higher than of GDP in and in and possibly lower. Next year target remains of GDP, they said. The news sent Italian government bond yields down, and overnight the euro gained against the dollar. Italy leading stock exchange, Milan FTSE MIB, closed up after several days of tumbling share prices. Speaking at a meeting of Italy largest employers’ lobby, the economy minister, Giovanni Tria, confirmed that the fiscal shortfall would be put on a downward path after next year. “The deficit will increase compared with the previous forecast in but then there will be a gradual reduction in the following years,” he said, without spelling out what the targets would be. Earlier, the League leader and deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, had indicated the government was changing tack compared with last week stance. “The goal [next year] is to get Italians working again and paying taxes as they work and therefore reduce the deficit and debt in the following years,” Salvini said in a broadcast interview. The coalition came to power in June promising to slash taxes and boost welfare spending, and says an expansionary budget next year will boost economic growth and thereby curb Italy debt – the largest in Europe after Greece at about of GDP. President Sergio Mattarella hopes there will be as little deficit spending as possible, but is not trying to dictate numbers to the government, a source close to the president said on Wednesday. Italian media have reported that Mattarella is exerting pressure on the government behind the scenes to keep public finances under control and avoid a head-on collision with the EU. “The majority of the member states will clearly ask and demand that these [EU budget] rules are observed,” Austrian finance minister Hartwig Löger, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Tuesday. Italy had previously pledged to Brussels that next year it would reduce its structural deficit, which is adjusted for the economic cycle and excludes one-off factors.",443,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/italy-aims-to-cut-budget-deficit-after-eu-criticises-spending-plans

Italy shooting: Mein Kampf found in home of suspect Luca Traini, was arrested by police in the main square of the central city of Macerata after the rampage, which injured six immigrants and terrorised the city last February. The sentence included an aggravating circumstance of racial hatred. Traini targeted black migrants as he drove around Macerata, hitting nationals from Ghana, Mali and Nigeria. He later abandoned his car and made a fascist salute, an Italian flag draped over his shoulders, as police arrested him. No-one died in the attack and Traini apologised in court for his actions. “I am sorry for the injuries I caused,” he said. “While in prison, I have understood that the colour of ones’ skin has nothing to do with anything.” Warning of 'dangerous acceleration' in attacks on immigrants in Italy The shootings came a month before national elections that were marked by furious debate over the influx of some mainly African migrants into Italy since The anti-immigration League emerged as the second-largest party in parliament at the vote and went on to forge a coalition government with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Northern League leader Matteo Salvini is the interior minister and has followed through on a campaign pledge to toughen migration laws. Traini had been an unsuccessful candidate for the anti-immigrant Northern League party and had previously been associated with neo-fascist groups. Traini launched his attack three days after the discovery of the body of teenager Pamela Mastropietro near Macerata. A Nigerian, Innocent Oseghale, has been charged with her rape, murder and dismemberment, as well as with drug dealing.

18,"A French gangster who made a Hollywood-style helicopter jailbreak has been found in northern France after three months on the run. Rédoine Faïd, a serial robber of banks and armoured vehicles and a fan of Hollywood mafia heroes, was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday morning in the Oise area north of Paris with his brother and two other men. A vast manhunt was launched after Faïd daring escape from a prison near Paris on July, in which two heavily armed accomplices set off smoke bombs then used angle grinders to break through doors and whisk him to a waiting helicopter. French gang may have used drones before helicopter prison break Two accomplices had pretended to be flight-school students and forced a helicopter instructor at gunpoint to fly them to the jail. The terrified pilot landed in the courtyard – the only part of the prison not fitted with anti-helicopter nets. Faïd was in the visiting room at the time, talking to a family member. The gang burst through doors and he was able to escape in just “a few minutes”, the justice ministry said. Faïd, had been serving years for the murder of a police officer during a botched raid and was being held in the isolation unit of Reau prison south of Paris. It was the second time he had escaped prison in only five years, after he broke out of another jail by blowing the doors off using explosives hidden in tissue packs and a weapon hidden in the laundry. In that raid, he took several prison staff hostage. The case sparked a political row over the security of French prisons, many of which suffer overcrowding and poor conditions. After a three-month hunt, Faïd was arrested at on Wednesday in Creil, a town in the Oise, where his family are from. He is believed to have moved around during his three months on the run. In July investigators found a stash of guns, masks and a cement cutter in the Oise region, which they believed belonged to his gang.

19,"The release of a stateless man who was held without charges by Canadian immigration authorities for six years has prompted renewed criticism of a system in which asylum seekers and other immigrants can be held indefinitely. Ebrahim Toure was freed by the Canadian Border Services Agency from a facility in Toronto last month, putting an end to what is thought to have been one of the country longest immigration detentions. Immigrant deaths expose 'legal black hole' of Canada detention system Canada is among the few countries in the world to rely on an immigration detention system with no upper limits. “It feels good to be out. I just want to go home and sit down,” Toure said in a statement. “It been six years since I’ve been outside – everything has changed.” Toure originally claimed refugee status in Canada after arriving to the country on a fraudulent passport. Immigration officials arrested him in believing he was a flight risk prior to his hearings. Although he was neither charged nor convicted of a crime in Canada, Toure was sent to a maximum security prison in Ontario for the first four and a half years of his detention. Toure legal team protested, arguing there was no indication he was any risk to the public. But Canadian authorities classified Toure as a “high-risk” case because of a prior conviction in the United States for selling illegal DVDs. “Given our review of the case at this time, the CBSA was comfortable releasing Mr Toure with conditions,” the agency told the Guardian in an emailed statement. According to reporting by the Toronto Star, Toure had separate hearings over the course of his detention, and like other immigrants who the government feared were a flight risk, was confined to prison-like space. There have been recorded deaths in immigration detention since said the Toronto-based advocacy group, No One Is Illegal, in a media release. It was only after a superior court judge in Ontario found his detention in a prison to be “cruel and unusual” that he was relocated to an immigration facility. Much of the debate around Toure detention status focused on which country would receive him following deportation. While he believes he was born in the Gambia and spend much of his childhood in Guinea, neither country would issue him the required documents necessary for repatriation. His eventual release prompted fresh calls for broader reforms to Canada immigration detention system. Max Chaudhary, an immigration lawyer in Toronto, pointed out that adjudicators overseeing immigration hearings – which can extend a petitioner detention – do not need to have a legal background, despite having powers similar to that of a judge. Canada detains hundreds of children for immigration violations, report finds “There been a lot of concern expressed the system. I mean, it even led to an audit from within the government itself. This was indicative of a problem that was both palpable and noticeable,” he said. The auditor report, issued over the summer, described a catalogue of systemic shortcomings, including inadequate legal representation for detainees, overreliance on the testimony of border officers and numerous factual errors used during critical decision making processes. Critical assessments of the system have also come from human rights activists, including the Global Detention Project , which has raised concerns over the detention of mentally ill immigrants and children . “The community is elated that Ebrahim is finally free,” MacDonald Scott, a member of Toure legal team, said in a statement. “However, his situation points out the futility of a system that detains people for immigration purposes regardless of whether that purpose will ever be achieved.”",604,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/cananda-ebrahim-toure-immigration-detention
20,"A Brazilian rightwing group led by a messianic cult leader who claimed to be in contact with aliens carried out terrorist acts to justify repression by the country military dictatorship, according to newly discovered archive documents. The revelation landed days before the country presidential election, amid a polarized campaign in which the frontrunner – far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro – has praised the dictatorship era as a golden age. According to an investigation by the independent news agency Publica , which drew on archive documents, the paramilitary group carried out terrorist attacks so that military rulers could tighten repression. Archive documents – including records of group members’ interrogations – revealed that the attacks were secretly encouraged by a general who was close to then president Arthur da Costa e Silva and in contact with federal police. The revelations added to other reports of state-sponsored, rightwing terrorism attacks during the military regime which ran Brazil from to 'Astonishing' CIA memo shows Brazil ex-dictator authorized torture and executions “There has always been a certain suspicion that groups of the right had actually organised to do some attacks. What is surprising is the richness of detail in these documents,” said Luiz Dias, a professor of history at the Pontifical Catholic University in São Paulo and specialist in Brazil dictatorship. The group was led by Aladino Félix, who wrote a book called My Contact with Flying Saucers under the pseudonym Dino Kraspedon, claimed to be the messiah of the Jewish people and had served in the army during the second world war. “He was seen as a crazy guy,” said Vasconcelo Quadros, who conducted the investigation, “but he had a relationship with the authorities.” Félix led a group of police officers who, between December to August carried out a series of terrorist acts – detonating bombs, stealing arms and explosives and robbing a bank. Targets included the São Paulo stock exchange, a secret police headquarters and an oil pipeline. In March armed leftist groups also began planting bombs. And as violence increased, in December the military government used leftwing terrorism as its justification to introduce a landmark decree that toughed up the dictatorship powers, ushering in its most repressive period, which became known as the anos de chumbo, or years of lead. A report by Brazil truth commission blamed the dictatorship for killings and disappearances. Félix and his group were arrested in Félix served a little over three years in prison, Quadros said, and eventually died in In a sergeant was killed and a captain injured when a bomb in a car they were waiting in at the Rio Centro convention centre in Rio de Janeiro exploded.

21,"An upstart conservative party that has never previously held power has swept to victory in Quebec provincial elections, in a result proving that – for the first time in nearly years – separatism is no longer the dominant political issue in Canada only majority French-speaking province. Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ), which was founded in took of the province seats, defeating the province establishment parties and upending decades of political precedent in the process. Canada: holdout of Quebec separatism faces end of the dream Led by François Legault, formerly a fervent believer in Quebec separation, the CAQ rode to victory in last night election on the promise to keep the province in Canada . “There are many Quebecers who put aside a debate that has divided us for years. There are many Quebecers who demonstrated that it possible for opponents to work together for tomorrow Quebec ,” Legault said during his victory speech. Legault is favour of reducing Quebec immigration levels, earning him praise from French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who tweeted: “Quebecers voted for less immigration.” The CAQ victory comes at the expense of the Liberals and the Parti Québécois, who have collectively governed Quebec for years. Both suffered their worst defeats in terms of popular vote in their respective histories. “Quebecers have clearly indicated their desire for change,” Liberal leader and former Quebec premier Philippe Couillard said in a concession speech Unlike previous campaigns in the province, bread-and-butter issues like environment, healthcare and the economy – along with a divisive debate over immigration – completely overshadowed the issue of separatism. And in a province long divided between federalists and sovereignists – as those in Quebec separatist movement call themselves – the CAQ victory is profound. “This is the kind of generational shift that we haven’t seen since the said Christian Bourque, from Léger, a Montreal-based polling firm, who added that the results will result in a radical reorganization of Quebec separatist movement. The Parti Québécois (PQ), long the dominant separatist political force in Quebec, will be either pushed into obsolescence or forced to merge with another new party, the left-wing Quebec Solidaire. “I don’t see how the Parti Québécois can survive what happened last night,” he said. The PQ has twice staged referendums to remove Quebec from Canada, losing both efforts in and The federalist Liberals have won successive elections by exploiting the existential threat posed by the PQ. The CAQ believes the obsession has stymied Quebec economic and political progression; Legault has promised to instead focus on the province high dropout rate and languishing productivity. Legault is himself a former PQ minister who once wrote a speculative budget underscoring the necessity for Quebec separation. He now believes Quebec can thrive in Canada – provided the federal government is open to handing over certain federal powers to Quebec. Exactly how Legault and the CAQ will negotiate with the federal government remains an open question. The spectre of losing Quebec has brought the province powers in culture, immigration and healthcare, among others. It is arguably the reason why Quebec receives outsized transfer payments from other provinces. By disavowing the pursuit of sovereignty, Legault has lost a powerful cudgel. Compounding Legault challenge is Quebec slackening demographic and political weight within Canada. Quebec population growth is eclipsed by neighbouring Ontario and several Western provinces. Nearly % of its population is aged and over, the highest outside of Canada Atlantic provinces, according to Statistics Canada. How did Quebec nationalist movement become so white? Not coincidentally, the province is in the midst of labour shortage. Despite this, Legault has vowed to cut immigration by saying current level of about yearly immigrants poses a threat to the French language and culture. Legault recently pledged to ban the wearing of religious clothing by anyone in a position of authority, including police officers, teachers and judges. Despite the CAQ victory, the sovereignty movement is not dead. Quebec Solidaire, aparty founded in more than tripled its seat count. Avowedly socialist with a platform that includes free kindergarten-to-gown education, Quebec Solidaire believes separation is necessary to free Quebec from the “petrostate” of Canada, as co-leader Manon Massé recently put it.",692,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/quebec-election-results-caq-victory-francois-legault
22,"An Austrian-American reporter who has been covering Nicaragua political upheaval for outlets including the Guardian and the Washington Post has been deported, his father has confirmed. Nicaraguan law enforcement officials took Carl David Goette-Luciak from his home in Managua Centroamérica neighbourhood on Monday morning, the Guardian understands. Later that afternoon Goette-Luciak, from Blacksburg in Virginia , was escorted on to a flight from the Nicaraguan capital to San Salvador in El Salvador. “I talked to him last night. He is fine,” Ilja Luciak, the freelance journalist father, told the Guardian on Tuesday. “There wasn’t the chance to talk about his time being interrogated but he was not hurt and he said he was fine … He was absolutely OK.” Luciak said he believed his son had been targeted for daring to cover “the state of repression” the president, Daniel Ortega, has installed since the outbreak in April of a deadly period of unrest that has claimed hundreds of lives and crippled the country economy . “The Ortega regime must have fear if they deport someone like Carl David. They really are trying to make work, particularly for foreign journalists, impossible … They don’t want the situation to be covered,” Luciak said. Nicaragua: what driving the uprising and what comes next? The Nicaraguan journalist Wilfredo Miranda tweeted a photograph of Goette-Luciak he said the journalist had sent him after landing in the Salvadoran capital on Monday. Goette-Luciak told Miranda he had been handcuffed and driven, semi-clothed, to Managua international airport, where he was questioned in a “white room” for about five hours until he was escorted on to his flight. One police officer told the journalist he was being deported for allegedly attending illegal protests and disseminating false information. “I explained to them that my work was impartial,” Goette-Luciak said. At one point during questioning, Goette-Luciak said an officer came in holding his mobile phone and said “that if I didn’t give him the password they would torture me and take me to El Chipote [a notorious Managua prison]”. “They asked me if I was a CIA agent,” Goette-Luciak added. Goette-Luciak, who will travel to the US on Tuesday, has been covering Nicaragua political convulsion since April, when protests against unpopular pension changes erupted and spawned a broader nationwide rebellion against Ortega and his vice-president, Rosario Murillo , who is his wife. Human rights activists say more than people have died since April, the majority at the hands of government security forces or pro-Ortega militias. Nicaragua government alleges fewer than have been killed and blames much of the violence on US-backed coup-plotters – claims rejected by most of the international community, including Nicaragua Latin American neighbours. The turbulence has devastated Nicaragua economy and nascent tourism industry . Luciak said his son had travelled to Central America largest country to work as an anthropologist but started reporting after his friend, the Nicaraguan reporter Ángel Gahona, was gunned down in the early days of the upheaval. Goette-Luciak subsequently wrote about Gahona killing in the Guardian and reported from the rebel-controlled town of Masaya for the Washington Post . He has also appeared on the BBC to report on the crisis. His coverage drew the ire of supporters of Ortega government. Last week the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) denounced what it called a targeted online campaign of smears and threats against Goette-Luciak. He was accused of being a CIA agent and of trying to undermine the government, and had his home address published online. The US blogger Max Blumenthal later published a lengthy, insinuation-infused attack on the journalist that admitted “there is no evidence that Goette-Luciak is an asset of the CIA or any other US agency”. In his article, Blumenthal, who conducted an unquestioning interview with Ortega this year and has been criticised for his reporting on the Nicaraguan crisis, painted Goette-Luciak as a “novice reporter” acting as a “publicist” for a Nicaraguan opposition that was set on regime change. After publication of this article a lawyer for Blumenthal contacted the Guardian to emphasise there was nothing to suggest his &nbsp; reporting contributed to the deportation of Goette-Luciak. The journalist father rejected the accusations made against his son. “He has no connection whatsoever to the Central Intelligence Agency. He is driven by his love for the Nicaraguan people and nothing else.” Luciak said he believed his son deportation was about far more than one individual reporter, saying: “It is just a story about how difficult it is for journalists to cover Nicaragua .” In August a German correspondent was attacked by armed men while reporting on land-grabs near the town of Chinandega and a Brazilian documentary maker, Emilia Mello, was deported after being detained while filming an anti-government demonstration in the town of Granada. In an interview with Brazil O Globo newspaper, Mello recalled being handcuffed, repeatedly interrogated and denied access to embassy officials. “I knew there was a risk of dying,” she said . Nicaraguan journalists have reportedly faced physical attacks, death threats and online smear campaigns. A Guardian spokesperson said: “We take the safety of our journalists, including freelancers, very seriously and are pleased that Carl David is now safe. We are committed to reporting on important stories which are in the public interest and will continue to report from Nicaragua. We are grateful to the Committee to Protect Journalists and others for speaking out on Carl David behalf.”",899,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/nicaragua-deports-reporter-who-covered-anti-ortega-protests
23,"Bolivia landlocked sailors pine for the high seas The United Nations’ highest court has rejected an attempt by landlocked Bolivia to force Chile to the negotiating table over granting access to the Pacific Ocean. In a legal ruling from The Hague-based international court of justice that was broadcast live throughout Bolivia , the panel said that a string of agreements, memorandums and statements produced over decades of talks had not created a legal obligation on Chile to enter negotiations. In a sweeping rejection of the Bolivian case, the court, by a majority, dismissed eight different legal arguments presented by Bolivia lawyers. Bolivia lost its only coast to neighboring Chile during an war and the country has demanded ocean access for generations. At hearings in March Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia former president, told judges: “Restoring Bolivia sovereign access to the sea would make a small difference to Chile, but it would transform the destiny of Bolivia.” But Chile argued in court that its border with Bolivia was settled in a treaty and that it had no obligation to negotiate. While rejecting Bolivia request for judges to order Chile to negotiate, the world court president, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, said the decision “should not be understood as precluding the parties from continuing their dialogue and exchanges, in a spirit of good neighborliness, to address the issues relating to the landlocked situation of Bolivia, the solution to which they have both recognized to be a matter of mutual interest”. 'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific Evo Morales, Bolivia president, who was in court for the ruling, told reporters that “Bolivia will never give up” its claim. “The people of the world know that Bolivia had an invasion and we had our sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean taken away from us,” he said. Chile president, Sebastián Piñera, lashed out at his Bolivian counterpart as he hailed the ICJ decision. “President Evo Morales of Bolivia has created false expectations in his own people, and has created great frustration in his own people,” he said in a statement. “We have lost five valuable years of the healthy and necessary relationship that Chile needs with all neighbouring countries, including Bolivia.” The ruling was broadcast on giant screens at public squares in the Bolivian capital, La Paz, and in an indication of the significance of the decision for both counties, Catholic bishops in Bolivia and Chile on Sunday called on their congregations to accept the court ruling “with faith, peace and good sense”. In Bolivia, groups linked to the government held public vigils to wait for the reading. As part of the preparations on Sunday, a group of spiritual guides called yatiris from the Aymara ethnic group made an offering to the Pachamama, or earth mother, on Sunday in a plaza in La Paz for a ruling favorable to the Bolivians.

24,"The homecoming of Brazil far-right presidential frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro from hospital was upstaged this weekend by huge demonstrations as concerns over his authoritarian tendencies grew. Bolsonaro flew from São Paulo to his home in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday, three weeks after being stabbed during campaigning , while tens of thousands of women filled the streets in cities across Brazil to protest against his extremist positions ahead of the October election. The news site reported anti-Bolsonaro protests in all Brazil states grew out of a Facebook group called Women United Against Bolsonaro which nearly million people have joined. Pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations took place in states, the site said. The piauí magazine website called the demonstrations “historic” and printed a photo of an enormous crowd in São Paulo which organisers claimed half a million attended, though police did not provide an estimate. In Rio the huge crowds that filled the city centre were notable for their diversity – with women of all ages, many of whom had brought children, male and LGBT demonstrators, chanting “not him”, an anti-Bolsonaro hashtag that has become a campaign slogan shared by celebrities like Madonna. Trump of the tropics: the 'dangerous' candidate leading Brazil presidential race Many demonstrators expressed concerns over Bolsonaro declaration in a television interview on Friday that he would not accept any election result he did not win because of his endorsement of the military dictatorship which ran Brazil for two decades. Flavia Carvalho, a civil servant, carried a “not him” banner designed around an Adolf Hitler cartoon. “He is preaching fascism,” she said. Others said they were protesting against the sexist, racist and homophobic views Bolsonaro has expressed. “He is sexist. He is misogynist. He is racist,” said Ana Paulo Gonçalves, a teacher. “He wants to go back to the military dictatorship,” said her sister Christine, a designer. Bolsonaro, a former army captain and veteran lawmaker, currently leads polling for a first-round vote on October. Running second is Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of São Paulo who took the place of formidably popular former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after Lula candidacy was barred because he is serving a prison sentence for graft. Bolsonaro and Haddad are expected to face off in a run-off vote on October. Making adept use of WhatsApp and social media, Bolsonaro has built support across Brazil, attacking Lula Workers’ party for its involvement in a huge graft scheme and espousing a hardline approach to law and order. His views have resonated with Brazilians angry and fearful over endemic corruption and rising violent crime. Supporters stage drive-by demonstrations, racing through towns across Brazil in convoys of cars and motorbikes, waving flags and blasting horns. The divisions Bolsonaro provokes in Brazil were evident in a video of him boarding Saturday flight from São Paulo. While some passengers regaled him with chants of “legend”, others yelled “fascist” and “not him”. Journey to Brazil heart: across miles and seven states, we ask – how will Brazilians vote? In a television interview broadcast on Friday, Bolsonaro suggested Brazil armed forces could intervene if his main rivals, the leftist Workers’ party, “committed a foul” in the election. “I don’t accept an election that is not me being elected,” Bolsonaro told reporter José Datena, adding that Brazil electronic voting system could be defrauded by the Workers’ party, but providing no evidence. Bolsonaro enjoys widespread support among police and the military. His vice-presidential candidate, Gen Hamilton Mourão, unnerved Brazilians recently when he said in a situation of “anarchy”, a president could declare an “auto-coup”. Both men praise the military dictatorship that ran Brazil from torturing and executing opponents. “I lived [during] this phase,” said Maria do Carmo, who was protesting in Rio and saw relatives imprisoned by the military regime. “It was terrible.” On Sunday, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper called on both leading candidates to make a commitment to democracy, accusing Bolsonaro of “stimulating paranoias of manipulation” and criticising the Workers’ party for its attacks on the justice system for Lula imprisonment it calls politically motivated.",672,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/huge-protests-in-brazil-as-far-right-presidential-hopeful-jair-bolsonaro-returns-home
25,"The town of Terrebonne is a collection of shopping malls and housing subdivisions amid vast stretches of what used to be farmland a drive north of Montreal. As a general rule, the streets are tidy and commuter traffic is wretched. And unlike most Montrealers, its citizens have enduringly and overwhelmingly supported the cause of Quebec separatism. But provincial elections on Monday are threatening the latter truism. Terrebonne is one of the last few redoubts of the Parti Québécois , which seeks to extricate Quebec from Canada . But according to polls, the PQ candidate trails his opponent from the Coalition Avenir Québec , a self-declared nationalist party that is nonetheless comfortable with Quebec place in Canada. All around Terrebonne, former fiefdoms of the PQ have either already fallen or are poised to be taken by the CAQ. Similarly, the CAQ wave will probably gobble up districts in and around Quebec City and engulf swaths of the province rural heartland – almost all of which were once reliably separatist. The CAQ is vying to replace the governing Liberal Party of Quebec, which despite myriad corruption scandals has governed Quebec for all but months of the last years. Parti Québécois governments held referendums in and on the issue of Quebec sovereignty – and lost both. Now, in contrast to flourishing separatist movements in Catalonia and Scotland, both the PQ and its raison d’être look like spent forces. “At a certain point you have to look at the numbers and realise that the dream of a separate Quebec is dead,” says Patrick Légaré, who lives in Terrebonne. Légaré once counted himself a true believer in the cause. He was a proud Péquiste for decades, and one of million Québécois who voted to separate in the referendum – only to watch his side lose by fewer than votes. After starting a family and becoming a high school teacher, his passion for sovereignty turned to resignation with the status quo. During this campaign, he volunteered to hang election posters for a local CAQ candidate. “I’m part of the middle class. We haven’t had anyone in government in Terrebonne in a long time, and it shows in our lack of infrastructure. We need someone who can beat the Liberals – and it isn’t the PQ,” he says. So unpopular is the cause of separation that PQ leader, Jean-François Lisée, renounced the idea of holding a referendum on the subject until a second mandate of a putative Péquiste government. Despite this, his party has languished in the polls throughout the campaign and is now in a pitched battle for third place with Québec Solidaire , an upstart socialist party founded in The PQ diminished threat is the main reason why, for the first time in nearly years, separatism isn’t a significant electoral issue. The slow collapse of the movement lies in its demographics. Separatism began in the during Quebec “ Quiet Revolution ” – the bloodless overthrow of Catholicism and the anglophone ruling classes that had both exerted an outsized social and economic influence in the province. Early Quebec nationalists saw separation as a natural progression. Yet the movement wasn’t able to maintain itself through near-constant infighting and lost two referendums. “To put it bluntly, old sovereignists are dying off and there simply aren’t very many young sovereignists to take their place,” says Claire Durand, a public opinion analyst at Université de Montréal. A recent IPSOS poll said only of those aged to considered themselves separatists. The CAQ has positioned itself as the receptacle of choice for disaffected nationalists. Led by François Legault, himself a former Parti Québécois cabinet minister, the CAQ gains have come mostly at the expense of the Parti Québécois. A one-time diehard separatist, Legault declared the idea “dead” in How did Quebec nationalist movement become so white? Legault has also criticised the current Quebec government immigration regime, suggesting the roughly yearly new arrivals to the province have a detrimental effect on the French language and culture. He has proposed French and “Quebec values” test for immigrants, with deportation from Quebec for those who fail either. (He has since backed off the deportation rhetoric – in part because citizenship is the jurisdiction of the federal government.) Critics say Legault is exploiting the collective fear of Québécois for electoral gain. “There is part of the population that has a tribal mentality, and Legault comes in with simple solutions and he asks nothing of his voters,” says Jean Dorion, a former politician and an enduring figure in Quebec separatist movement. Though immigration dominated both the rhetoric and the coverage of the campaign, many Québécois don’t see it as a ballot box issue. A recent study by La Presse, the province main daily, said it placed well behind more pressing priorities such as the environment, health and the economy. Légaré priorities are schools, infrastructure and an end to the Liberal reign — and that means bringing about an end to the PQ. “My vote for the CAQ isn’t from the heart, it practical,” he says. “We believe the dream for a country is dead and we just want to get rid of the Liberals.”",857,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/terrebonne-hold-out-of-quebec-separatism-faces-end-of-the-dream
26,"Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz. Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag. Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto : “The sea is ours by right. To recover it is a duty.” Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict is still vivid – as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more. Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on October after five years of deliberations. Bolivia landlocked sailors pine for the high seas “Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat. Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia claim that – after decades of fitful talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea. Evo Morales, Bolivia charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – also has plenty riding on Monday ruling. “We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he vowed in late August. But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia favour – and that little would change if it did. The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks. That the ICJ ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case “wasn’t complicated”, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law. And far from furthering Bolivia cause, the past four years may have set it back. “The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate. Morales belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested. “Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk … [but] it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.” The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision-making was unusually speedy. Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “put an end to years of disagreements with mutual benefits”, he said. Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America most popular presidents – was using the maritime issue as a political crutch. “Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added. “The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”",475,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/landlocked-bolivia-pacific-sea-international-court-of-justice
27,"The last time Renata Souza saw her friend and colleague Marielle Franco, they hugged and kissed and said they’d see each other the following morning. They were scheduled to meet with higher-ups from their political party to finalize Franco as a vice-gubernatorial candidate for the state of Rio de Janeiro. But minutes after they parted, a reporter called Souza to tell her that Franco had been murdered. A breakout star on Rio political scene, Franco was a black woman from one of the city poorest favelas who defied the odds to become the fifth most voted-for councilor in 'I'm waiting for her to come back': Marielle Franco fiancee on life a month after Rio councillor murder She was an outspoken critic of Rio heavy-handed police and had recently become the chair of the committee overseeing the city federally mandated military intervention . Franco and her driver Anderson Gomes died instantly when two men opened fire on their car on March in what police believe was a targeted assassination. No arrests have been made, but as Brazil prepares for legislative elections, Franco legacy can be seen across the country: an unprecedented number of black women have registered to run for office – and many invoke her example on the campaign trail. As well as choosing a new president next Sunday, October, Brazilians will also elect congresspeople, senators and more than state legislators. Although she was a local politician, Franco murder fuelled an urgent conversation about racial and gender representation among Brazil elected officials. While black women are of the population – Brazil largest demographic group – they only hold of seats in congress. This new generation of politicians – often campaigning with the slogan “ Marielle presente ” – hopes to start levelling the playing field. Souza is now running for a seat as a state legislator. “I always thought about being on the frontline myself, but Marielle murder brought a sense of urgency. I hesitated for months, but knew I had to run,” she said. “Now I feel her every single moment – in every flyer I hand out, every speech I give, every conversation, every joke.” Souza and Franco met as teenagers in a college prep course in Maré, the Rio favela where they both grew up. They both won scholarships to one of Rio best private universities and went on to pursue graduate degrees. They became outspoken human rights activists and became involved with a newly founded leftwing party, the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL). After Franco was elected in Souza became her chief of staff. “I feel a responsibility to continue what we’d been building for the years we were activists together,” Souza explained. If elected, she will focus on legislation related to reducing the number of homicides of poor, black residents in Rio periphery. The first bill she hopes to pass would ban police operations during the hours when children are going and coming from school . Ahead of next month election, a group of women launched Black Women Decide, a collective aiming to raise black female candidates’ profiles and present data about the challenges confronting black women in politics. Brazil current congress includes only black women. In the election, of total campaign spending for congressional candidates went towards black women, even though they represented of candidacies. Juliana Marques, a member of the collective, says the dynamics of funding create a vicious cycle, as parties tend to invest most money in incumbent candidates. “The rules of the game are rigged. But we’re the largest portion of the population – for the sake of democracy, we should have lawmakers that are at least somewhat similar to the demographic makeup of the population.” Many voters agree. “Marielle was our voice. It was such a blow to lose her, but I never expected in my lifetime to see so many black women running,” said Martilde Guilhermina, at a rally in Rio, where Souza and other black female candidates were speaking. “Politics is a space where we black women have always been denied access.” Igor Soares, a high school teacher, said: “You don’t need to look far in Brazil to see how diverse it is … I’d like to see politics reflect that more, in order to make Brazil less racist and less machista .” Journey to Brazil heart: across miles and seven states, we ask – how will Brazilians vote? After a recent rally in Rio, Dani Monteiro, a from a Rio favela also running for a seat in the state legislature, said: “Most of the representatives in the state legislature are white men. They can’t even imagine living the reality we live – they don’t live with constant shootings, having to protect your kids from stray bullets. “We don’t yet know the scale of what we’re doing: we’re in the eye of the storm now — but I really think we’re a part of a historic moment in Brazil,” Monteiro said. Franco legacy has reached far beyond Rio: hundreds of kilometers north in the Amazon region, Vivi Reis, who is running to be a deputy in the lower house, also cites Franco as a political inspiration. “Her murder was a way of trying to shut us up, in the most brutal way, but it done the opposite of that. Now we’re screaming louder.”",885,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/brazil-sees-black-female-candidates-surge-after-of-rising-star
28,"Japan prime minister, Shinz ō Abe , has appointed just one woman to his new cabinet, raising questions about his commitment to “make women shine” in business and public life. But he claimed that the regional revitalisation minister, Satsuki Katayama, had “the presence of two or three women”. Deepening the controversy over gender equality in Japan , Katayama was forced to buy a new dress after being told her outfits did not comply with the existing official dress code. Abe was accused of repaying party factional debts rather than addressing the gender imbalance in politics following his reshuffle on Tuesday, a fortnight after he was re-elected president of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP). His victory virtually guarantees he will still be in office in November next year, making him the country longest-serving prime minister. But his decision to appoint one woman to the relatively low-profile role of regional revitalisation minister prompted criticism from an outgoing female minister and uncomfortable questions at his post-reshuffle press conference. Asked why there was only one woman in his cabinet – one fewer than in his previous lineup – Abe claimed he had only just embarked on his “womenomics” campaign to raise the standing of women in the workplace, although it is a cause he first championed soon after becoming prime minister in late “We must recognise that the ratio of women cabinet ministers is low compared with other countries, but Japan has just begun to create a society where women can be more active,” he said. “I think we will nurture people who can become cabinet ministers.” He claimed that the lone female appointee, the former career bureaucrat Katayama, had the determination of multiple women. “She is incredibly feisty. I know there is only one woman in this cabinet, but Ms Katayama has the presence of two or three women. I hope she will use that to promote the goal of female empowerment,” he said, according to the Japan Times. Seiko Noda, who was replaced as internal affairs minister by a man, said she was “extremely worried” about the lack of female representation in senior positions in the party. Katayama, whose brief includes promoting gender equality , was forced to buy a new dress shortly before a ceremony at the Imperial Palace to announce the new ministers, after a Cabinet Office official said neither of her two existing outfits met the dress code. The Mainichi newspaper said cabinet officials told her other outfits were inappropriate because the jackets and dresses were different colours, adding that a long dress and jacket of the same colour was “the norm” – reportedly suggesting silver. Katayama and her secretary rushed to a department store and later returned to her office carrying a bag. “I found an outfit that follows the dress code,” she told reporters, according to Kyodo News. She wore a long silver dress with matching jacket in the official photos. While the new cabinet includes first-time appointees, Abe was accused of rewarding politicians who supported his LDP re-election campaign and who can be relied on to back his agenda, including plans to revise the country pacifist constitution. “He has appointed old friends and reliable allies and kept people in key portfolios to buy stability,” said Jeffrey Kingston, the director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo, adding that Katayama appointment “exposes the empty grandstanding on womenomics”. The challenges facing women in the Japanese workplace received widespread attention this summer after it was revealed that Tokyo Medical University had deliberately altered entrance exam scores for more than a decade to restrict the number of female students and ensure more men became doctors. Earlier this week, Yuka Ogata, a female local assembly member, claimed she was being targeted by male colleagues after taking her baby son into the chamber last year to highlight the difficulties encountered by working parents. Ogata, whose experience generated negative headlines about Japan treatment of women in the workplace , was expelled from a session of the Kumamoto municipal assembly last week for sucking a cough sweet while addressing colleagues. Japan ranked out of countries in the World Economic Forum global gender equality rankings last year – down three places from a year earlier and the lowest among the nations. The report said the poor assessment reflected the low number of women in politics .

30,"Australia has expressed concerns about China “aggressive tactics” in the South China Sea after a Chinese navy destroyer sailed within yards of an American warship on the weekend. Christopher Pyne , Australia defence minister, said the Morrison government would view any use of intimidation in the region as “destabilising and potentially dangerous”. According to a US official, the USS Decatur guided-missile destroyer was conducting a “freedom of navigation operation” in the South China Sea on Sunday , when it passed within nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson reefs in the contested Spratly Islands. Chinese warship sails within yards of US destroyer in 'unsafe' encounter Beijing claims the entire Spratly island chain as part of its sweeping claims across much of the South China Sea, but the archipelago is contested. China repeatedly asserts its right to build “defence” facilities in the region, which it views as key to pushing its defences beyond China coast and securing oil supply routes, but it has been accused of building “ island fortresses ” on the islands. Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have overlapping claims in the region. A US official has claimed the USS Decatur was conducting a freedom of navigation operation in the region on Sunday when a Chinese Luyang destroyer approached in “an unsafe and unprofessional manoeuvre in the vicinity of Gaven Reef in the South China Sea.” The Chinese destroyer reportedly conducted a series of “increasingly aggressive” manoeuvres, warning the Decatur to depart the area. It then approached “within yards of Decatur bow”, forcing the Decatur to manoeuvre to prevent a collision, Cdr Nate Christensen, US Pacific Fleet spokesman, said on Monday. Pyne said the Morrison government would view such tactics as “potentially dangerous”, and called the reports “concerning”. “We would view any use of intimidation or aggressive tactics as destabilising and potentially dangerous,” he told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. “Australia has consistently expressed concern over ongoing militarisation of the South China Sea and we continue to urge all claimants to refrain from unilateral actions that would increase tension in the region,” he said. His comments were first reported by the Australian . China defence ministry said on Tuesday that a Chinese naval ship had been sent to warn the US vessel to leave, saying it was resolutely opposed to an operation that it called a threat to its sovereignty.

32,"ndonesia is no stranger to destructive earthquakes and tsunamis, but what was surprising about the devastating, magnitude quake that shook the island of Sulawesi last Friday was the size of the tsunami that followed. About minutes after the quake, six metre-high (nearly waves surged through the coastal resort of Palu, destroying buildings and killing hundreds of people. Most tsunami-generating earthquakes in this region emerge from movement on the Sunda “megathrust” fault where the Indo-Australian plate dives down underneath the Eurasian plate. Violent vertical motion caused by thrust quakes can displace a huge volume of seawater, setting off a high-speed tsunami wave. Indonesia twin disasters: a visual guide to the devastation However, the recent Sulawesi quake occurred on a “strike-slip” fault, meaning the plates lurched horizontally past each other and shouldn’t have displaced much water . So what caused the tsunami? One possibility is that the quake triggered an underwater landslide, which would have displaced water and created a tsunami wave. Alternatively, if the rupture occurred on a steeply sloping region of the seafloor, the horizontal motion could have pushed seawater in front of the slope. And almost certainly the tsunami was magnified by the narrow shape of the bay, with the wave energy focused by the coastline as it rolled towards Palu.",212,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/terrawatch-why-did-the-quake-in-sulawesi-cause-palu-tsunami
33,"Dramatic footage has emerged from the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with buildings collapsing as the ground slides beneath them. The phenomenon, known as soil liquefaction, is thought to have occurred as a result of the recent magnitude earthquake, which also triggered a devastating tsunami. The death toll has already passed and is expected to rise further. Soil liquefaction can occur in saturated loose soil that is suddenly shaken – for example by an earthquake. What caused the Indonesia tsunami and could lives have been saved? “When soil is saturated, the space between individual particles is completely filled with water,” said Dr Stavroula Kontoe of Imperial College London. “Seismic shaking increases the water pressure between the soil particles; the particles can lose contact with each other which in turn leads to an overall loss of soil strength and stiffness.” The upshot is that, with the particles no longer bound tightly together, the soil loses its structure and behaves like a liquid. “In very simple words, when liquefaction occurs, the strength of the soil decreases and, the ability of a soil deposit to support foundations for buildings and bridges is reduced,” said Dr Carmine Galasso from University College London. Kontoe said that certain areas are at higher risk than others from the phenomenon. “Reclaimed land and river banks which typically consist of loose deposits are prime locations for liquefaction in case of strong shaking,” she said, adding that it is unlikely that the tsunami was involved in the soil liquefaction seen in Indonesia , but rather that the earthquake was responsible. Kontoe added that it is not only building and above-ground structures that can be affected by the phenomenon, noting there can also be damages to pipelines such as those for clean water, wastewater and gas. The scenes from Indonesia are not the first time soil liquefaction has caused damage following an earthquake. The phenomenon is thought to have caused severe and widespread devastation in Japan after an earthquake struck in It was also blamed for contributing to the damage done by the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand. But Kontoe says disasters are not inevitable. “There are several mitigation techniques which can limit or even eliminate [soil liquefaction] consequences. These techniques usually involve strengthening the soil deposits in areas where liquefaction has been identified as a major hazard and/or adopting drainage measures to prevent the increase of the water pressure during the strong shaking.” Galasso agrees there are ways to reduce risk. “Building codes and standards in many countries require engineers to consider the effects of soil liquefaction in the design of new buildings and infrastructure such as bridges, embankment dams and retaining structures,” he said.",449,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/indonesia-earthquake-soil-liquefaction-blamed-for-building-collapses
34,"What caused the tsunami? Scientists are still trying to determine the exact cause. The earthquake that occurred on Friday morning was not a thrust earthquake, the kind that is responsible for most tsunamis, where tectonic plates move vertically up and down and displace water. Instead it was caused by what is known as a strike-slip fault, where tectonic plates move horizontally. According to Phil Cummins, a professor of natural hazards at the Australian National University, these earthquakes usually lead only to very weak tsunamis. It has been suggested that Friday earthquake could have caused a large underwater landslide that displaced the water. This submarine landslide could have occurred either in Palu bay, close to the shore, or further out to sea. Usually tsunamis are caused by earthquakes hundreds of miles from shore, and the shaking is rarely felt on land. As Cummins noted: “It is unusual to see a double disaster like this.” It will take months of field research and underwater exploration to determine the cause. What early warning systems were in place and did they fail? There have been claims that Indonesia meteorological and geophysics agency, BMKG, may have removed a tsunami warning too early, before the waves hit the coast of Palu, and was thus responsible for some of the loss of life. There have also been suggestions that buoys out to sea that detect earthquakes and tsunamis as part of the early warning system had not been serviced for six years and were faulty. Indonesia tsunami: food and water run out as death toll tops However, Cummins and Adam Switzer, the chairman of the Asian school of environment at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, were in agreement that the disaster was a failure not of technology but of education. Unlike the tsunami that devastated south Asia, this wave was not was prompted by an earthquake hundreds of miles out to sea. Instead it was a localised tsunami resulting from an earthquake close to the coast. It has been estimated that the tsunami waves hit Palu only minutes after the quake. “For the people on the beach and in the city, the earthquake should have been the early warning,” Switzer said. Cummins said: “The focus on the technological points of failure here is misguided because this was a localised tsunami. In that case you can’t rely on a warning system; people should seek high ground immediately. They cannot afford to wait for a siren or a warning, they need to move instantly. The problem is, from what I’ve seen from the footage, many people appear not to have done that.” He added: “Either they didn’t know they needed to do that or they didn’t believe anything would happen, and in either case that says the people in Sulawesi were not educated about what they need to do in this situation. And that what killed people.” What made the tsunami so destructive? Questions remain about how far out to sea the tsunami originated, and therefore how much speed it gathered – some estimates have suggested it was moving at in Palu bay but slowed down substantially before it hit the shore. The waves were six metres high in some places and reached up to a kilometre inland. It has been suggested the narrow shape of Palu bay concentrated and amplified the force of the wave. “The shape of the bay in Palu could play a role,” said Cummins. “It can funnel the energy and concentrate it at the tip and that will focus the tsunami. It is also a very a deep bay, which means the tsunami could move at high speed.” Switzer said the initial impact of a tsunami caused the most destruction, though the movement of debris when the wave pulled back could also prove deadly. “The most devastation from the tsunami is generally the force of the water hitting objects as it strikes the coast. The tsunami water going between buildings also accelerates the velocity,” he said. Were the earthquake and tsunami unexpected in the area? Switzer said: “There a large and well-documented fault system that runs through Palu, which is about long. There was an event like this in and other events in the early though it not clear if they caused tsunamis. And there was a paper published in in which it was suggested that the Palu fault, which is very straight and very long, had the potential for causing a very destructive earthquake and tsunami. So it not like this is unexpected. But the question is, did we learn anything from past incidents? It doesn’t seem so.” Dr Kerry Sieh, of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, said: “It well known that that fault in Palu has been storing strain and accumulating strain at a few centimetres per year, so it a been very rapid slipping fault for years.”",806,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/what-caused-palu-indonesia-tsunami-and-could-lives-have-been-saved

36,"Tanushree Dutta was sheltering inside her trailer on the set of a Bollywood music video. Outside, she recalled, a crowd of men were banging at the door. They demanded the actor emerge and finish her shoot. She refused. When Dutta parents finally arrived and picked her up, footage from the incident shows the men surrounding the car, shattering the windshield and trapping the family inside. Dutta, a former Miss India , had walked off the set after alleging that she was sexually harassed by Nana Patekar, a leading Bollywood actor. For a few days after the incident, her allegations were widely reported. Then the story vanished. “There was no compassion,” she said. “Nobody was really listening.” Patekar denies the allegations. But in the past week, Dutta, has become the face of a #MeToo campaign in Indian cinema that is pushing the industry closer to confronting its treatment of women. Bollywood sexual harassment: minister for women writes to film-makers Suddenly, A-list stars such as Priyanka Chopra are tweeting about the imperative to #BelieveSurvivors. New witnesses are going public in support of Dutta account. The industry biggest male stars are being asked about the allegations at press conferences. “Neither is my name Tanushree, nor Nana Patekar, so how can I answer your questions?” was the curt reply of superstar actor Amitabh Bachchan. Dutta said she was surprised by the attention over her story, a decade after she first raised the allegations. “Being heard is something I had given up on,” she said. She stepped away from the Bollywood spotlight around and emigrated to the US for a quieter life two years ago. There, she followed the accusations against Harvey Weinstein closely. When she returned to India for a holiday in July, an interviewer asked why the country was yet to have a #MeToo moment. “I said we are not going to have one until what happened years ago is acknowledged, addressed and brought to justice,” she said. Bollywood sexual harassment: actors speak out on Indian cinema open secret The journalist tweeted the quote. “Her tweet went viral. And then the interview went viral. I would say everyone conscience got pricked,” Dutta said. Few actors in Bollywood have dared accuse a high-profile figure, says Paromita Vohra, a filmmaker and writer. “You can only do it when you have nothing else to lose,” she said. Patekar says it is impossible that he could have sexually harassed Dutta unnoticed on a crowded shoot. “There were people on the set with me,” he told Times Now TV. He has threatened to lodge a police complaint accusing Dutta of spreading false allegations. Initially, Dutta renewed accusations drew little response from Bollywood. Then a woman came forward with her account of what she saw that day. “Some incidents that take place even a decade ago remain fresh in your memory,” wrote journalist Janice Sequeira in a thread of tweets. “What happened with Tanushree Dutta on the set of ‘Horn OK Please’ is one such incident – I was there.” Sequiera, who arrived midway through the episode, described seeing Dutta become upset and storm off set, then have her car attacked as she tried to leave. She said she went to the actor house at midnight that evening, where Dutta recounted the sexual harassment claims. Other witnesses have backed Patekar. “He a very sweet person, he can never do that,” said Ganesh Acharya, the lead choreographer on the shoot. Major stars are now expressing frustration at being asked about the allegations. Salman Khan, one of the industry best-paid actors, put his hand over his face when the issue was raised at a press conference on Saturday. “I am not aware of this, my dear,” Khan said. Indian cinema is notorious for plots where men aggressively pursue women, who initially resist but are soon won over by their suitor persistence and charm. It reflects and reinforces a casual attitude towards harassment across Indian society at large, Dutta says. “Indian psychology has been trained by popular media, by what they witness at home and outside in the streets,” she said. “Harassment has also been a part of our culture. It taken lightly.

37,"akia Wardak family has been fractured and diminished by long decades of war in Afghanistan. Soviet forces killed her father four decades ago, Americans seized and tortured her husband two decades later and her brother was murdered in the capital this past summer. Yet, somehow, she has not abandoned hope. Relatives abroad begged her to join them after the latest killing. Instead, convinced that Afghanistan can still change, that the peaceful country of her childhood memories can be reclaimed, she has taken a tentative step into the dangerous, notoriously corrupt arena of Afghan politics, running for a seat in parliament. “There a lot of injustice going on, particularly affecting the younger generation,” said Wardak, a successful engineer who virtually shuttered her business several years ago to focus on health and women rights. “If you have a seat in parliament, you can raise people voices.” The odds are stacked against her. It is still not clear if the October vote – widely seen as a trial run for an even more high-stakes presidential poll next spring – will go ahead. The election is already more than three years overdue and mired in controversy. Some opposition leaders want further delays so that biometric checks on voter identity can be brought in. Officials have already quietly dropped plans for a vote in one key province, eastern Ghazni, without bothering to inform voters or provide an explanation. If the poll does take place elsewhere, voters and candidates alike would be targets for militant attacks, and the results would almost certainly be skewed by serious corruption. “If it a clean vote I think I will be one of the winners, but I am concerned about what happens on election day,” Wardak said at campaign headquarters. “There is a lot of money involved, a lot of rich candidates and people who have different types of support.” Yet she is not alone in her conviction that democracy, though embattled, can still work in Afghanistan and a fight against powerful vested interests can be won. She is part of a wave of candidates, mostly young professionals and entrepreneurs, running in defiance of security concerns and long, bitter experience of parliament as graft-ridden and ineffective. Many came of age after the Taliban were toppled in including the entrepreneur Hamed Warasta. “It time in Afghanistan for the younger generation to do something,” he said, in the headquarters of the conglomerate he built up after a childhood as an impoverished refugee, which supplies everything from printing paper to military uniforms. “At some point we have to stop just relying on our own elders. It the moment for us to prove ourselves to them and the nation.” The election comes at a difficult time. The country has been convulsed by waves of extreme violence, with deaths of civilians setting grim records this year and so many soldiers killed that security forces casualties are now classified information . The Taliban control more territory than at any time since they were ousted from power, and threaten swaths of the country beyond their main bases. In August militants rampaged for days through Ghazni city , only miles from Kabul, as the central government seemed paralysed by indecision and incompetence. Meanwhile, Islamic State has spread its murderous sectarian violence into a country that had been spared at least that one poison amid its other miseries. Although there is more focus on peace talks than there has been for many years – from both Afghans and their US backers, and the Taliban – efforts have slowed as elections draw closer. The Taliban have less incentive to deal with an administration that may be replaced in months and negotiations are a gamble for officials facing an election. That threat of violence makes campaigning hard. Given that bombers have recently targeted schools and sports clubs , rallies are a huge risk both to candidates and those attending. Venues and security are also expensive in a city where candidates are vying for fewer than seats. So Wardak, who describes her campaign as “grassroots activism”, aims to meet influential community figures in small groups and has organised volunteers to reach out to their peers. “To reach people I talk to them face to face and tell them what I have done,” she said. “I also have a big crowd of young people who knock on doors with my biography to discuss my campaign, a group of elders who go to the mosque and say I am the right candidate, and professionals who speak to other professionals.” Looming over all the confusion and fears for the parliamentary vote is next year presidential election. President Ashraf Ghani took power in a controversial compromise cobbled together after a poll marred by widespread allegations of fraud. No one expects a clean fight this spring, with control of the country at stake. Afghanistan is already one of the most corrupt countries in the world, according to Transparency International, and power brokers hoping to gain or hang on to lucrative positions will throw huge sums at the campaigns. A new voter registration system suggests spending has already begun, with the numbers signing up to vote “too good to be true”, according to the Afghanistan Analysts Network thinktank, which picked through statistics from the new electoral roll. Among the suspicious details were an unprecedented enthusiasm for voting in conservative areas where turnout has traditionally been low and many registration centres could not open because of violence. “Several of the highest rates of registration can be found in some of the most insecure provinces,” the analyst Scott Worden wrote. “Four – Paktia, Nimruz, Nangarhar and Nuristan – saw more than of their estimated eligible voters registering.” Still, western countries funding the elections insist both the parliamentary and presidential polls will happen. Without elections that donors can claim are credible, the flow of foreign military support and aid funds that sustain the Afghan government may falter. “Everyone agrees they are not going to be perfect,” said one senior diplomat. “But I think they will be better than people expect.” It would be easy to describe the coming year as critical for Afghanistan. It is an adjective overused for many years by foreigners who dropped in on brief military and diplomatic tours as troop numbers swelled then were cut back down. In reality, the country has long lived on the brink of catastrophe. “I hate this phrase ‘critical period’. Since my first memories, things have always been very sensitive [in Afghanistan],” said a former Afghan security official. Conflict has plagued the country since and the violence is exacerbated by poverty, illiteracy, industrial-scale opium production and widespread addiction. The civil war has gone through so many iterations that there are few enemies that have not been allies in the past, or allies that were not once enemies. The US once embraced the mujahideen as freedom fighters when they battled the Soviets; now their Taliban heirs are waging a fierce jihad against American forces. Meanwhile, Russia stands accused of arming the insurgency, though it denies funding militants. While those cycles of violence have often bred despair, history may also serve as a spur towards peace. The US is weary of a war that is now its longest ever, and its western allies now also accept that – despite overwhelming advantages of money and technology – they must talk to the Taliban. “The main issue is that no one is going to win this militarily,” said one senior western diplomat. Seventeen years after the first US soldiers invaded Afghanistan, this might seem like stating the obvious, but it was barely five years ago that Barack Obama claimed America war in Afganistan was “over” , and David Cameron declared “mission accomplished” . 'Isis will be looking for targets': guns and fear mark Afghan Ashura As the Afghan government grapples with shrinking territory and America growing impatience, senior officials have also made greater overtures to insurgents, declaring a unilateral ceasefire that prompted the Taliban to respond in kind over Eid. The first official break in fighting since was hugely popular. For three days Taliban foot soldiers flooded into cities for ice-cream and selfies and urbanites with government links returned to homes in insurgent-controlled areas that had been off limits for years. It showed that the Taliban could control its fighters and that ordinary people on both sides were desperate for the fighting to stop. Now they just have to hope they can get through the elections safe, and with a leadership – whether new or renewed – that can build on the promise of those brief, heady days.",1432,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/zakia-wardak-afghanistan-young-politicians-democracy-elections
38,"Iraq newly named president, Barham Salih, has chosen the independent Shia politician Adel Abdul-Mahdi to be the next prime minister and form a government. Legislators claim the move will address the widespread civic unrest in Iraq , and ease standoffs across the country that have brought governance to a standstill, nearly five months after the national election. Abdul Mahdi, a former oil minister, has been given days to assemble a cabinet to be approved by Iraq parliament. The political jockeying involved in appointing him is likely to continue and intensify in the coming weeks as regional patrons vie for influence in bitterly contested portfolios that rival the premiership as power bases in the country complex political landscape. Protests spread through cities in Iraq oil-rich Shia south Iran and the US, which remain instrumental in Iraqi affairs, had been robustly pushing their own candidates in the lead up to Tuesday announcement. Rivalry between Tehran and Washington has played out in Iraq over the years since the US-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein. However, it has become particularly acute during the Trump administration, with its intense focus on countering Iranian activities in the Arab world. Baghdad remains a central area of Iranian influence and a political and cultural battleground between groups aligned to each side. Salih, a Kurdish leader, was named as Iraq president a day ago, on Tuesday. Abdul Mahdi, a compromise candidate, edged out as prime minister the US favourite and incumbent leader, Haidar al-Abadi , and Iran two options, the former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki , and Hadi al-Ameri. Barham Salih: I wish there had been another way The presidency remains largely ceremonial in Iraq, with most executive power resting with the prime minister. Abdul Mahdi is the first leader since not to be aligned to the Shia Islamic Dawa party , which has taken a central role in the country post-war affairs. He has cordial relations with the US and his appointment was not opposed by Iran. Under Iraq postwar constitution, the president must be a Kurd, the prime minister a Shia, and the speaker of parliament a Sunni. The divisions of authority give the three dominant sects a stake in the country affairs. However, power is often bitterly contested along sectarian lines leading to regular governance breakdowns and a long list of grievances – including complaints of rampant corruption, sclerotic services and a bloated, inefficient public sector. Successive Iraqi governments have failed to address enduring issues, which were largely eclipsed over the past four years as the country security forces battled large-scale insurgency by Islamic State (Isis). Protests about services have rumbled through the southern city of Basra throughout the summer and had led to growing acrimony among residents who claim that an unaccountable political class has prospered while their living standards have plummeted. Tensions with the Kurds of northern Iraq also remain high, with Kurdish leaders insisting Baghdad needs to honour earlier agreements about revenue sharing from oil proceeds, as well as restore the semi autonomy which was diminished after the Kurds launched a failed push to control the northern oil city of Kirkuk.",518,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/iraqi-president-names-adel-abdul-mahdi-as-next-prime-minister
39,"France has concluded that Iran ministry of intelligence was behind a foiled bombing attack that targeted a rally organised by an Iranian opposition group near Paris in June. Rudy Giuliani calls for Iran regime change at rally linked to extreme group The Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), a fringe organisation loathed by Iran establishment, had accused authorities in Tehran of planning the attack near Paris. An Iranian diplomat was among six people who had been arrested for allegedly plotting the bombing of the MEK event, which featured among its guests senior US politicians, including Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump attorney . French diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that they believed a ranking official from within the Iranian ministry of intelligence had ordered the attack. He was named as Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, a deputy minister and director general of intelligence. Belgian authorities said in July that an Iranian diplomat, who works for Tehran mission to Austria, was arrested in Germany, while a married couple – Belgian citizens of Iranian heritage – were detained with “attempt at terrorist murder and preparing a terrorist crime” against the MEK. It emerged on Tuesday that the Iranian diplomat Assadollah Assadi is poised to be extradited from Germany to Belgium for prosecution. The Belgian-Iranian couple were in a Mercedes car when they were stopped by special forces and arrested in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, which is close to EU institutions in Brussels. According to Belgian media, police found grams of TATP explosive and a detonator hidden in a toiletries bag. On Tuesday France said it had frozen the assets of Assadi and Hashemi Moghadam, who it described as operatives acting on behalf of Iranian intelligence. Who is the Iranian group targeted by bombers and beloved of Trump allies? A joint statement from France interior, economic and foreign affairs ministries, said: “A planned bomb attack was foiled at Villepinte on June This extremely serious attack that was to take place on our territory cannot go without a response.” It went on: “Without prejudicing the results of a criminal proceedings taking against the initiators, the perpetrators and the accomplices of this planned attack, France has taken targeted and proportionate preventative measures in the form of adopting national measures to freeze the assets of Mr Assadollah Assadi and Mr Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, Iranian nationals, as well as the Internal Security Directorate of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence,” the official statement read. The asset freeze was published in France Official Journal on Tuesday and will last for six months. Jean-Yves Le Drian, foreign affairs minister, said the foiling of the bomb plot “confirms the need for a tough approach in our relations with Iran”. Iran denied the allegations which it called a conspiracy to “sabotage Iran ancient and long-standing relations with France and other significant European countries”. “We deny the accusations and forcefully condemn the Iranian diplomat arrest and call for his immediate release,” the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. But Tuesday news puts further strain in relations between Iran and France, which is among European countries defending the nuclear accord against Trump attempts to tear it up. France has postponed sending a new ambassador to the Iranian capital and has advised diplomats and other officials to postpone visits to Iran. The foiled attack came ahead of a rare visit to Europe by the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who was travelling to the EU to lobby officials to salvage the nuclear deal after Trump said the US would not honour it. Iran has two parallel intelligence services, often competing and at times at odds with each other . Tuesday accusations were directed at the ministry of intelligence, which is nominally part of Hassan Rouhani government, but in fact heavily controlled by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The elite Revolutionary Guards, which act independently of Rouhani government, also has a powerful intelligence arm. Who is the Iranian group targeted by bombers and beloved of Trump allies? Tehran considers the MEK as a terrorist organisation – a view that until recently was shared by the US and the EU. The US removed it from its list of terror groups in , but the MEK animosity with Iran rulers has earned it powerful allies in the west, most particularly among Trump associates such as John Bolton, who is the group most powerful advocate. The bomb plot was discussed by Le Drian and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammed Javad Zarif, in a bilateral meeting during the recent United Nations general assembly. A French diplomat told Le Monde it was an occasion to “mention the very heavy suspicions concerning the Iranians and the seriousness of those suspicions”. In a separate operation, French anti-terrorist police arrested people during raids on a pro-Iranian Shia Muslim association based in Grande-Synthe, a suburb of Dunkirk. Police said the arrests were not linked to the June bomb plot.",803,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/france-blames-iran-for-foiled-bomb-attack-near-paris
40,"Even to a country inured to violence, the images were shocking. A man on a motorbike pulled up next to a car window and fired three shots at Tara al-Fares, killing her on a Baghdad street. The daylight assassination, captured by a surveillance camera, was both brazen and familiar to Iraqis who lived through the civil war and painful decade since. Yet it was also shockingly distinctive; the body slumped in the car seat was not a politician, official, insurgent or warlord. She was a former beauty queen; a young woman with both profile and attitude, one of four high-profile Iraqi women to have been killed across the country in quick succession. The four were unknown to each other, but their lives – recently at least – had shared common themes. All had a public presence and a voice that had unsettled elements of Iraqi society, which has retained rigid views on how women should behave, even as relative freedoms have crept into a still conservative culture. To reveal one such trait in post-war Iraq is daring, many Iraqi women say. To proudly showcase both can be reckless. The effervescent Al-Fares has become a lightning rod for all four deaths, and sparked a rare public discussion in Iraq about how far women have come in the years since the US invasion, the proponents of which had vowed that civic freedoms and individual liberties would somehow emerge from the ensuing chaos. The death of Al-Fares, last Friday, followed the killing of Suad al-Ali, a women rights activist in the southern city of Basra, who was gunned down as she walked to her car. In August, two more Iraqi women, Rasha al-Hassan and Rafifi al-Yasiri were killed one week apart. Both worked in beauty clinics. Iraq acting prime minister, Haider al-Abadi has said that that the deaths are not random events and has pledged to hunt down the attackers. Iraqi women have gone further. Zainab Salbi, an Iraqi who leads the institute Women for Women International in Washington said “Women are being hit left right and centre. Everywhere. We are living in the modern witch-hunt.” Al-Fares did not fit the mould. A divorced single mother who had married at she had swayed her way into Iraqi homes with short skirts and makeup on social media platforms. She had million Instagram followers and was popular on Twitter , Facebook and YouTube . All are hugely popular in Iraq, where living vicariously remains acceptable – but maintaining a high profile brings danger, especially for women. “We can go to Lebanon and dress how we want,” said Hadeel Muthanar, who identifies herself as a socially conservative from east Baghdad. “Even Iraqi men will look the other way there. But to do the same in Baghdad is shameful. This is two-faced, but it the way we are.” Al-Fares, born to a Lebanese Shia mother and an Iraqi Christian father, made little attempt to bow to the norms that many expected of her. Her profile was created as a challenge to double standards that many in Iraq complain about but remain unwilling to tackle. The reaction to Al-Fares’ death on social media was part sympathetic and part scathing, a reflection of how what she stood for had polarised Iraqis. A state media employee was sacked after labelling Al-Fares a “whore” on social media posts. In August, the death of Dr Rafif al-Yasiri, a renowned plastic surgeon also created ripples. The was labelled the “Barbie of Iraq” and spoke regularly of women gaining independence by changing their appearance. Iraqi officials claimed she died of a drug overdose. One week later, popular beautician, Rasha al-Hassan, was found dead inside her home. Her cause of death remains suspicious. “The enormous amount of messages I noticed on social media have made me sick,” said Zainab, who added that the recent killings had made her afraid to reveal her surname. “They say: ‘They deserved what they got because of their actions.’” “People are accusing these girls of abusing their own freedoms. But it is the understanding of freedom that is being abused. The families are being forced to defend themselves instead of mourn their loss and this is wrong. Rusul Kamil a female activist and specialist on gender- based violence, said: “I think that what happened to these girls is considered as a threat for all Iraqi women and girls who want to live their lives freely, regardless of their ethnicity, religion and roles. Diversity and difference became a risky approach for all women.” Sura Ahmed, a Baghdad university student agreed. To her the deaths are unlikely to change attitudes which still resent “untraditional women”. “We have seen it before with brothels being bombed and nightclubs being shot at. This is a message to “know your place”. I fear that people will soon listen. And I don’t think these crimes will be solved.”",811,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/death-of-high-profile-iraqi-women-sparks-fear-of-witch-hunt
41,"Israeli forces have killed seven Palestinians, two of them children, and shot more than others in one of the bloodiest days of a six-month protest movement along the frontier, the Gaza health ministry said. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled strip said Nasser Mosabeh, and Mohammed al-Houm, were hit by sniper fire near the perimeter fence that surrounds one side of the sq mile coastal enclave. Israel army said around people had gathered at multiple sites along the frontier. “The rioters sabotaged security infrastructure, attempted to cross the security fence and infiltrate into Israel in several locations and hurled over (improvised explosive devices) and grenades towards IDF troops and the security fence,” the Israel Defence Forces said in a statement on Saturday. It said no IDF injuries were reported. Troops “responded with riot dispersal means and operated in accordance with standard operating procedures”,the army said. Israeli aircraft also bombed two Hamas positions in response. Palestinians have protested weekly since March in what they call the “Great March of Return”, demanding that Arabs who fled or were expelled around the time of Israel creation in to be allowed to return to their homes. Demonstrators have also focused on a crippling decade-long Israeli-Egyptian blockade that has trapped much of the strip population and devastated its economy. Israeli attacks have killed more than people, the majority by bullets but also bombings. Children, medics and journalists have been shot, often as they stand far back from the fence. One Israeli soldier has been shot dead. During the past two weeks, the Hamas-led Friday rallies have grown in size and also moved to evenings and night-time, a move protesters say is to save lives as people can move under the cover of darkness. Piles of tyres have also been burnt to obscure the snipers vision. The international aid group Doctors Without Borders says it had treated more than patients with gunshot wounds, of whom were hit in the lower limbs, since the protest began. The youngest patient treated was seven years old, the group said in an email. Nearly half of those shot had fractures and some injuries included severely splintered bones. “The threat of life-long disabilities for these patients is getting bigger as time goes on,” it said. Israel says its actions are focused on preventing people from entering its territory and accuses Hamas of using the mass rallies to stage attacks. On Friday, it said several Palestinians had breached the fence but immediately returned. The World Bank warned on Tuesday that Gaza economy is in “freefall” . It cited the blockade as a factor but also economic sanctions from Hamas political rival, the Palestinian Authority, and a steep reduction in international aid, particularly from the Trump administration. It said unemployment was now more than and higher than among Gaza youth. “A combination of war, isolation, and internal rivalries has left Gaza in a crippling economic state and exacerbated the human distress,” said Marina Wes, the World Bank director for the region. The frontier bloodshed had brought Israel and Hamas close to war, leading this summer to the most severe exchanges of fighting since the conflict, with Israel using airstrikes while Hamas fired mortar bombs and rockets. A UN-backed ceasefire effort, mediated by Egypt, appeared to have stalled this month.",545,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/two-children-among-seven-people-shot-dead-by-israel-say-officials
42,"An Egyptian woman who made a video alleging sexual harassment has been given two years in prison and a fine on charges of “spreading false news”. Amal Fathy, an actor and a former activist, uploaded a video to her Facebook account in May detailing how she was sexually harassed during a visit to her bank and criticising the government failure to protect women . Two days after the post, Egyptian security forces entered her home in a pre-dawn raid and arrested her along with her husband and young son, both of whom were later released. Fathy was subsequently put on trial accused of spreading false news with intent to harm the Egyptian state and possessing “indecent material”. She was sentenced to one year in prison for each charge, and given a fine of Egyptian pounds for making “public insults”. In a second trial that is under way, she faces allegations that include being a member of a terrorist organisation. In a UN survey in of Egyptian women reported that they had experienced some form of sexual harassment . Cairo was described as the “most dangerous megacity in the world for women” in a Thom son Reuters Foundation poll . Mohamed Lotfy, Fathy husband and the head of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms – who was barred from the courthouse during sentencing, said: “The sentencing is an appalling verdict that contains a message for every harasser, that he is free to harass without fearing punishment, and to every victim of harassment that if she speaks out, she will be jailed.” Amnesty International also condemned the sentence . “This is an outrageous case of injustice, where the survivor is sentenced while the abuser remains at large,” said Najia Bounaim, its North Africa campaigns director. “She is a human rights defender and sexual harassment survivor who told her truth to the world and highlighted the vital issue of women safety in Egypt . She is not a criminal and should not be punished for her bravery.” Other women who have attempted to publicly discuss their experiences of harassment in Egypt have faced similar treatment. Mona el-Mazbouh, a Lebanese tourist who recorded a comparable video during her stay in Egypt, was arrested at Cairo airport and sentenced to eight years in prison in July, accused of “spreading false rumours that would harm society, attacking religion and public indecency”. Her sentence was later reduced to one year and then suspended, before she was deported to Lebanon in September. Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the Egyptian president, who came to power after a military coup in drew a large female following, partly due to his promises to ensure women safety on Egypt streets and combat harassment.

Officers said they were investigating driver culpability following the incident in Salalah, close to the border with Yemen. A British man is understood to be in a stable condition in hospital after being injured in the crash, which happened on Thursday. Investigators are looking into whether the driver had a licence, and a post on social media from the Royal Oman police said initial conclusions indicated “the cause of the accident [was] the driver deviation from the track”.

You can sit down and talk about it, but demand the immediate release? What are we, a banana republic? Would any country accept it?” said the foreign minister, Adel Al-Juebir, at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, as world leaders gathered forthe United Nations general assembly. Al-Juebirreferenced a tweet sent by Canada foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, calling for the release of jailed activists Samar Badawi and her brother, Raif Badawi. Raif Badawi wife and children are Canadian citizens. It was a separate tweet of the same content, but translated into Arabic and sent by the Canadian embassy in Riyadh, that in August prompted a wave of anger from the Saudi government, culminating in the expulsion of Canadian diplomats, the near-cessation of trade and the removal of all Saudi medical students from Canadian universities. In his comments on Wednesday, Al-Juebir also attempted to return the criticism, alluding to issues of separatism in French-speaking Quebec and Canada treatment of indigenous communities.

45,"Every day the war in Yemen goes on “is a day that a mother loses their child”, the UN envoy to the country has said as he announced a plan to restart peace talks. The scheme would introduce a set of confidence-building measures within a week, including reopening Sana’a airport, prisoner swaps and payment of civil service salaries. It was arranged by the UN special envoy Martin Griffiths after a frenetic round of meetings in New York designed to prevent Yemen from sliding towards a humanitarian disaster as fighting escalates. Griffiths said he was optimistic that overlapping steps could be agreed by Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led coalition that includes the United Arab Emirates and that backs the UN-recognised government of Yemen. He said: “There is a huge appetite for this. Both sides reconfirmed to me their desire to be reconvened, and they both recognise that there is no other solution to this war apart from through this process. We are now working on ways to get them back together as soon as possible.” He said as many as prisoners on either side needed to be exchanged. Sana’a airport is blocked by the Saudis. Griffiths said the confidence-building measures had been due to be discussed at talks in Geneva a fortnight ago that did not in the end take place. He said there was no need for the two sides to be in the same building for the measures to be agreed. The talks in Geneva would have been the first between the two sides for two years, but the Houthis refused to travel from Yemen after seeking assurances about the safe passage of some of its wounded soldiers. Griffiths admitted he had no power to demand a ceasefire or prevent the Saudi coalition from pressing ahead with plans to capture the strategic Red Sea port of Hodeida, through which most humanitarian aid into the country flows. “What I won’t do is to make stopping the war a condition for us to resolve it,” he said. In the wake of the collapse of the Geneva talks, the UAE announced plans to restart the military action. In a letter to the UN security council on September, it said: “The Houthis would not have engaged with the special envoy unless there was a fear of losing access to the Red Sea along with the supply of weapons and funds that sustain them. The capture of Hodeida is critical to re-engaging the Houthis in peace talks.” Aid agencies in New York urged the Gulf states not to press ahead with plans to besiege the city or to cut off the aid supply, including to the Houthi-held capital, Sana’a. The UK, which advises Saudi Arabia on military and political strategy, says it has been calling for restraint. In a sign of the complex diplomatic cross-currents over Yemen, EU states including the UK clashed with Saudi Arabia on Friday by backing a one-year extension of the mandate for an independent group of experts set up to investigate breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen. In a report in August that was rejected by the Saudi-backed Yemeni government, the experts said they had found widespread breaches of the law and said the predominant responsibility for deaths lay with the Saudi coalition. Huge spike in Yemen violence as civilian deaths rise by in four months At a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council, the mandate to renew the experts’ work was passed by votes to eight, with abstentions. The Gulf states and China opposed the move, while the UK said the humanitarian situation and human rights in Yemen were deteriorating. The UK said: “It is important to give the group of eminent experts more time to fully examine the conflict and to ensure that their conclusions accurately reflect the conduct of all parties in future reporting. It is clear that many incidents and alleged violations committed by all parties have not yet been fully documented, particularly those committed by Houthis.” The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, met the Saudi and UAE foreign ministers on Thursday, in part to discuss the humanitarian crisis and to stress the need for a political solution.

46,"t Miksalište refugee centre in central Belgrade, young asylum seekers are queueing up to get a free haircut. The room is packed with newcomers, connecting their phones to plug extensions and wifi; elsewhere, two people are playing table tennis. Some have just arrived from the Middle East and north Africa, others have been sleeping rough in the nearby Park Luka Ćelović, known locally as Afghani Park. But unusually in Serbia – a gateway to the EU – it is Iranians who make up significant numbers of new arrivals. Last year, Serbia became the first country in mainland Europe to offer Iranians visa-free travel. Hostels and apartments are full to the roof thanks to Iranian tourists. In Knez Mihailova, Belgrade pedestrian zone, Farsi is frequently heard. However, many Iranians are not taking their return flights. Planes arrive full and leave empty. They are driven to the west partly because of economic hardship, exacerbated by Donald Trump new sanctions that have sent Iran currency, the rial, into a tailspin. Soroush Rahmani, arrived in Serbia four months ago. He was using a leave period from his refugee camp to sleep rough in the capital, gearing up for his overnight “game” – to try to enter the EU. Tonight would be his ninth attempt. Like other refugees, Rahmani has deposited with a money exchange bureau to pay for his passage. This will only be released to his smuggler once he has called to confirm he has successfully reached Italy. “Iran was like hell,” he says. “I prefer to sleep in cardboard here rather than live in Iran .” US ready to drive Iranian oil exports to zero, says US national security adviser Hungary tough border security means Rahmani will attempt to enter the EU through Croatia. Many refugees first cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the longer border gives them a better chance. Bosnian media reported recently that the number of Iranians seeking asylum in the country this year (up until September) stood at compared to Iranians in the whole of last year. “Every time a refugee plays ‘the game’ they are putting their lives at risk,” but some see no legal alternative, says Milena Timotijevic from the International Rescue Committee. “They are at the mercy of unscrupulous smugglers and human traffickers; they are frequently pushed back, violently, by border guards; they are subjected to ‘survival sex’ and other forms of sexual abuse. And yet they never stop trying.” Hasan Kameli was arrested by Hungarian police during his last game. They released him in the Serbian border town of Subotica, but only after days in jail, where he says he was beaten. “I lost my hope about the future of living in Iran. I sold my motorbike, which was all I had, to come here,” said the who has a motorcycle tattoo on his right leg. “You can’t live in Iran anymore, you can just remain alive there, there is no future in Iran.” Gordan Paunovic, the director of the NGO Info Park, said the number of Iranians arriving was growing fast. “You immediately recognise Iranians,” he said. “You see Syrians, Afghans they all look poor. Suddenly you see a group of kids with backpacks, who look like they’re on the school excursion … You look at them and you give them a smile and you get so many smiles back. “Everyone who comes [from Iran] is either LGBT, or Christian or politically oppressed, or was fighting in Syria for Assad and decided to leave because they didn’t like it.” Most Iranians arrive on one of the two flights a week that land in Serbia. At Info Park, the Guardian met an Iranian couple with a son and a daughter who had arrived by plane four days earlier and were inquiring about seeking asylum. The daughter – a bright student just a year before her crucial university exam in Tehran, was the only one speaking English. She was clearly anxious about her father decision to stay, asking how long it would take her to go to school in Serbia. Serbia tourism minister, Rasim Ljajić, who is trying to promote tourism by abolishing visa requirements, said that in the first seven months of this year, Iranians visited Serbia. More than of these have expressed a desire to seek asylum. It is not known how many of these proceed to the EU. But not everyone wants to go to the EU. The Guardian visited an asylum camp miles outside Belgrade in Bogovađa village, where Iranians were living. Amin, a gay Iranian, fled from the Iranian city of Shiraz after his father reported him to the police for having sex in the house with his partner. His friends bought him a one-way ticket from Tehran to Belgrade. “When I arrived, they kept me in the airport for six days – I had no money, no hotel reservation and no return ticket,” says Amin. “I came here with nothing. In Iran, my biggest threat was my own family, not the government. Family is the biggest problem when it comes to LGBT.” Like Amin, many refugees are detained immediately at the airport – have been deported since last year. The Guardian spoke to a group of Iranians held in a detention centre at Belgrade Nikola Tesla airport who said they were beaten up, humiliated and kept in horrible conditions for more than a week. They sent pictures of themselves with bruised arms and legs, and a toilet overflowing with faeces. The Serbian interior ministry denies that the guards used force against them and said one refugee fractured his hand after falling down. Back in the Miksalište refugee centre in Belgrade, Samsour, a Afghan, ate bread and cheese given to him by his cousins. He has not been able to shower for six days, nor has he a blanket for the cold nights. The outside walls of the refugee centre have recently been transformed by an Iranian artist called Reza. One wall features a cartoonish depiction of a journey from Africa, and a cake behind the wire fences of the EU surrounded by yellow stars. An eagle is breaking into the fence, reaching a blue area, reminiscent of the colour of the EU flag.

47,"Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that Israel had identified a “secret atomic warehouse” in Tehran, containing nuclear equipment and radioactive material. Israel prime minister called for new sanctions against Iran and accused European leaders of “appeasement” for opposing them. In a speech to the UN general assembly on Thursday, Netanyahu said he was revealing the existence of the “atomic warehouse” for the first time in public. As he has in past presentations , Netanyahu brought visual aids to illustrate his claims. He held up a satellite image which he said showed where the warehouse was located in Tehran, and a photograph of a nondescript wall and metal gate, which he said showed of the exterior of warehouse. Netanyahu described the facility as a “secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran secret nuclear weapons programme”, but gave no further details, other than to allege that government officials had spread of the radioactive material around the streets of Tehran in an attempt to dispose of it. He said a nearby rug cleaning business should check its wares for radioactivity. Tehran is party to a agreement curbing its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. As part of the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) it dismantled uranium-enriching centrifuges and a reactor and exported most of its stockpile of enriched uranium. It is not clear, even if some surplus equipment was stored in a Tehran warehouse, whether it would represent a violation of the JCPOA. Dismantled centrifuges were to be stored in specified locations under international monitoring, but there not specific stipulations on the storing of other ancillary pieces of hardware. Since the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly certified that Iran is abiding by the terms of the JCPOA. But Netanyahu urged the IAEA director general, Yukiya Amano, to investigate the warehouse Israeli intelligence had identified. “Do the right thing. Go and inspect this atomic warehouse immediately,” Netanyahu said. Donald Trump broke ranks with his European allies in May by withdrawing the US from the agreement and calling for the sanctions to be reimposed on Iran. An effort by Trump to win support for his Iran policy on Wednesday however left him isolated as other council members voiced their support for the JCPOA as long as Iran continued to abide by the agreement. Netanyahu lauded Trump and condemned European states, accusing them of appeasing Iran, and making clear he was deliberately drawing parallels with the Nazi era and the initial failure of the UK and France to stand up to Hitler Germany. “I just used a strong word: appeasement,” Netanyahu said. “I use it reluctantly but unfortunately that is exactly what we are seeing again in Europe.” “I’m a historian son,” the Israeli prime minister went on. “I have to ask: have whether these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?” Netanyahu theatrics&nbsp;help push Trump towards Iran deal withdrawal In a similarly dramatic presentation in April , Netanyahu unveiled what Israel claimed was a nuclear archive that the country intelligence services claim they had seized and smuggled out of Tehran. Documents purported to have been part of the archive appear to have previously been seen by the IAEA, as early as and made public by the agency in Asked about the possible significance of the “atomic warehouse” Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department responsible for implementing the IAEA, said: “I’m sceptical just because this would be a strange and ineffective way to release this information. But if the Iranians are found to be in violation, it would be a different story.” “For the Iranian government … Netanyahu speech is merely pageantry,” said Holly Dagres, nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council and editor of the council IranSource blog. “Unfortunately for Netanyahu, his annual general assembly speech fell flat in the United States, his primary audience after Israel , since the speech took place during the Kavanaugh hearing. Tehran will likely see this as somewhat of a blessing.”",668,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/netanyahu-claims-israel-has-found-irans-secret-atomic-warehouse
48,"Ministers are pressing to toughen the government stance towards Iran by proscribing the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah in Britain. Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based political party and militia, and since the UK has banned only Hezbollah military wing or apparatus, not its political arm. The call to ban the group has been a longstanding demand of the British Jewish community, and many Tory MPs are eager to use an outright ban to contrast the Conservative approach to antisemitism with that of the Labour party. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt , has been pushing for tougher action, but reports of an announcement by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, at the Tory conference were not confirmed. Hunt is also eager to find ways to put pressure on Iran in the wake of its refusal to release the Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe . He has accused Iran of using her as a diplomatic pawn. Critics of Hezbollah, including the Labour MP Joan Ryan, the chair of Labour Friends of Israel, claim there is not any true distinction between the military and political wings, arguing they both promote antisemitic propaganda, the export of terror and the extinction of Israel. According to Home Office assessments, Hezbollah is committed to armed resistance to the state of Israel. Hezbollah blames Sunni militants for commander death A total ban would help Javid to argue he is closing down so-called safe spaces for terrorism. Until recently the government has argued that the political wing is not proscribed because ministers, acting on security service advice, have to strike a balance and maintain contact with the Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is a member. The security minister Ben Wallace has said the police have sufficient powers to prosecute cases of racial hatred. In a statement soon after becoming foreign secretary, Hunt described Hezbollah as an “outrageous, disgusting” organisation and said he deplored the group in its entirety. The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, has argued that proscription of the political wing would not conflict with the UK duty as a government to speak to ministers in the Lebanese government. Hezbollah, which is mainly Shia supported and Iranian financed, is already considered a terror group by the US, Canada, Israel and the Arab League. The European Union banned the political wing of Hezbollah in after an attack by members of the organisation on an Israeli tour bus in Bulgaria in which resulted in the deaths of five Israelis and their Bulgarian Muslim bus driver. During a lengthy meeting at the UN general assembly in New York on Thursday, Hunt pressed his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, to intervene in the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held in jail for two years. Hunt came away believing Zarif understood the UK position. He said: “The central issue here is that the Iranian government is detaining innocent people as a tool of diplomatic leverage, and we cannot operate on that basis. Zarif understood the British position, but what happens inside the Iranian regime frankly is more complex. We are not going to let this situation rest, or ignore the problem. “I want Iran to publicly recognise that this is a situation that they need to address and that this is not a stable situation. What they are doing is holding innocent people to create diplomatic leverage.”",554,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/hezbollah-could-be-banned-in-uk-in-bid-to-toughen-iran-stance

50,"Theresa May has used a pair of speeches at the UN summit in New York to firmly contradict Donald Trump isolationist view of the world, arguing that the best way to resist extremist forces was through close cooperation between countries. The prime minister, speaking a day after Trump address to the UN general assembly explicitly rejected global cooperation in favour of a “doctrine of patriotism”, even delivered a polite if direct rebuke to the US president over his abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal . May, who was addressing a special session of the UN security council on weapons proliferation chaired by Trump, told the president that the deal remained “the best means of preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon”. Trump urges world to reject globalism in UN speech that draws mocking laughter The prime minister, in her main address to the general assembly shortly afterwards, reiterated her call for transnational cooperation, saying public disillusionment about economic and political systems risked a return to influence for far left and far right ideologies. “We have to show there is a better way to meet the concerns of our people,” she said. “That way lies in global cooperation between strong and accountable states based on open economies and inclusive societies.” While Downing Street was adamant that May choice of words was not intended to be critical of Trump, whom she was meeting one-to-one in a final engagement before leaving New York on Wednesday evening, the strong language would be seen by many as a counterpoint to Trump stark statement to the UN: “We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.” She did also say countries should address the worries of “those who feel that the global economy is not working for them”, citing reform of the World Trade Organization as one area where action was needed. In her security council speech May also warned of potential renewed military action if chemical weapons were again used in Syria . Russia and other backers of Syria government should seek to avoid repeated use of chemical weapons, she said, adding: “For there must be no doubt: we will respond swiftly and appropriately if they are.” May also condemned what she said was Russia “desperate fabrication” in response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack. On Iran, May said the long-negotiated international deal on the country nuclear programme, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), had been “an important step forward” in addressing worries about Tehran nuclear ambitions. She said: “It remains the best means of preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and we are committed to preserving the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to abide by its obligations in full.” Trump announced in May he was breaking with European allies over the Iran deal, and signed an executive order reimposing sanctions on any foreign company that continued to do business with Iran. May has repeatedly and publicly disagreed with Trump over his decision. She praised Trump for his talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un , saying this had “created a historic opportunity for complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation” on the Korean peninsula. But here, too, she played up the role of international cooperation, saying previous sanctions imposed by the UN “played no small part” in getting Kim to the negotiating table. May, in her condemnation of Russia over the novichok attack in Salisbury, said: “We have taken appropriate action, with our allies, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our collective security. Russia has only sought to obfuscate through desperate fabrication.” More widely, May praised the multilateral treaties on weapons proliferation as “one of the greatest achievements of the international community, demonstrating the value of global cooperation”. She said: “It has improved all of our security. It has brought a measure of predictability and stability. And it has paved the way to arms control agreements and disarmament.” May ended by again reminding Trump about the benefits of cross-national work: “Mr President, it was collective engagement by states across the globe that produced the counter-proliferation framework. “Even the most powerful recognised that investing in collective rules-based restraint was the only effective way of addressing national security interests and avoiding unilateral recourse to force.” Despite her criticism of Trump strategy, the prime minister later held talks with him in New York, where they discussed the issue of a US-UK trade deal following Brexit. Trump is risking more than a war of words with Iran | Simon Tisdall “They agreed that Brexit provides a wonderful opportunity to strike a big and ambitious UK-US free trade agreement,” a No statement said. They also discussed Syria , and taking action against what Downing Street called “Iran destabilising regional activity”. The White House statement on the talks cited discussions on various international situations, but made no mention of a trade deal. May, asked by reporters ahead of the talks how the British people could believe Trump would stick to his word over trade, given his habit of sometimes changing his mind about international agreements and his tendency to routinely say things that are untrue , argued he had shown trustworthiness. She cited examples including the US decision to expel Russian diplomats in the wake of the novichok nerve agent attack on Salisbury. This meant he could be trusted on a trade deal, May said, arguing the omens were positive: “It in both our interests to do that good trade deal, and I believe that when we have negotiated that deal it will indeed be put in place.”",930,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/may-chides-trump-over-decision-to-abandon-iran-nuclear-deal
51,"n November Ryszard Kapuściński telexed his editor in Warsaw to plead for permission to return home from Angola. The era of Portuguese colonialism was ending, the fight for independence that would become one of the many proxy battlefields of the cold war was intensifying and, after three months spent on dangerous roads and in a capital city growing more paranoid and hallucinatory by the day, the Polish Press Agency reporter was spent. “My money ran out and I am barely alive,” he wrote. “It is more or less clear what will happen, which is that the Angolans will win, but it is going to take a while and I am on my last legs.” Kapuściński, long acknowledged as one of the greatest journalists of the century for his literary evocations of wars and revolutions in Africa and Latin America, was right on both counts. He was haunted by what he had seen, what he had done – and what he had failed to do – while the nascent conflict he had chronicled would stagger on until The experience provided him with the raw material for Another Day of Life, his deeply personal book “about being alone and lost” in the chaos and confusion of Angola . Eleven years after Kapuściński death, the book has been adapted into an award-winning film that mixes animation and documentary to retell and update the story. The idea came to the film co-director, Raúl de la Fuente , and his producer and partner, Amaia Remírez , when they were on holiday on Menorca years ago. The Spaniards had loved Kapuściński since they were teenagers, and saw Another Day of Life as both a geopolitical parable and a portrait of a journalist enduring a dark night of the soul. One of the main challenges they faced was how to evoke the sense of confusão “a state of absolute disorientation” – that permeates the book. The answer lay in Kapuściński two-notebook habit: one for straightforward, factual reporting; one for impressionistic observations and reflections. While De la Fuente and Remírez travelled to Angola to shoot documentary footage and track down the book surviving protagonists, the Polish animator Damian Nenow took on the task of translating Kapuściński brutal poetry for the screen. “His descriptions of the world and how it changes are pure animation – they just cry out for animation,” says Nenow. The journalist thoughts, fears and recollections are rendered in surreal sequences of disintegrating cities, bodies and even a fragmenting telex machine. In one of the film most stunning scenes, Kapuściński and an Angolan journalist, Artur, come across a long stretch of road littered with the corpses of civilians, and imagine them being slaughtered by a cloud of weapons that roils a red sky. “We never debated whether it was right or wrong because it somehow felt natural in the context of Kapuściński writing,” says Nenow. “This guy wasn’t following facts per se; he was always showing the world through the prism of the emotions of the people he met. He was always adding a lot of allegorical magic and poetry to it.” Accusations of “not following the facts per se” – or of simply inventing episodes – were levelled against Kapuściński in a biography published eight years ago , which claimed he had crossed the line between reportage and fiction. Nenow acknowledges the controversy, but says Kapuściński remains an iconic figure in Poland , where, he says, people have long been aware of his approach. “Kapuściński books are obligatory in school; you have to read them when you’re a teenager. So it not a surprise for any Polish person – it not rocket science – that he was not strictly following facts.” Another Day of Life ends with the journalist speculating as to the fates of some of those he met in the confusão of Artur, the bright young guerrilla Carlotta, and the Che Guevara-like figure of Comandante Farrusco, a Portuguese special forces soldier who swapped sides to fight for liberation. It was that epilogue that gave De la Fuente his way into the film, which is released in Spain this month and is due to reach British cinemas next year. “I had the chance to go back to Angola with my camera and look for them, and say, ‘Look Ryszard, here Artur’, who feels like the biggest loser in the war because the society he wanted never materialised, ‘here Farrusco’, who still a soldier, ‘here Carlotta sister’. I felt I had to fulfil a commitment to him and I wanted to answer his questions.” Not long before he died in Kapuściński and Farrusco managed to speak by phone with the help of the Polish ambassador in Angola. The former commando, who still addresses people as “comrade”, is now and his bones have begun to ache as he tends his garden. Time, however, has done nothing to diminish his affection and admiration for the middle-aged Pole who materialised at his redoubt almost half a century ago, an unexpected emissary from a habitually indifferent world. “Kapuściński was a born writer and he someone who’ll never be forgotten in Angola,” says Farrusco. “He knew what injustice was. He wasn’t just a journalist. Journalists sometimes do in-depth reporting from war zones but Kapuściński was a man of principle. I don’t have the words to describe exactly what his presence and personality meant.”",893,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/reporters-angola-memoir-made-into-animated-film-another-day-of-life
52,"Efforts to fight the continuing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo were set to resume on Wednesday after a suspension following a attack by militia in which people were killed. At least people have died so far from the recent outbreak of the disease, and people are known to have been infected. The decision to resume the effort to vaccinate thousands of people in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri will go some way to reassure worried health officials. Ebola: medics brace for new cases as DRC outbreak spreads The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday that the outbreak could worsen rapidly because of the attacks by armed groups, as well as because of community resistance and the broad geographic spread of the disease. The outbreak has occurred in one of the most violent parts of DRC, a base for dozens of armed groups that contest government authority and exploit mineral resources in the region. The militia attack on Saturday took pace on the outskirts of the city of Beni. In a second incident, in the town of Oïcha, about miles north of Beni, armed men burned houses, killed one man and kidnapped children and one woman on Monday night, according to two local officials. Both attacks have been blamed on a group known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which has a history of targeting civilians and is considered one of the most active and violent of the armed groups operating in the region. The insecurity in the region and a mobile population has made vaccination campaigns – like the one that helped overcome an Ebola outbreak that killed people in the DRC north-west this year – less effective. Insecurity is likely to intensify as tensions rise with the approach of elections later this year, observers said. “We are now extremely concerned that several factors may be coming together over the next weeks and months to create a potential perfect storm,” Peter Salama, the World Health Organisation emergencies chief, told a news conference in Geneva. Although the weekly number of new cases has fallen from about to about in the past few weeks, and more than people have been vaccinated, significant obstacles remained, Salama said. Nyonyi Masumbuko Bwanakawa, the mayor of Beni, said vaccination of people had resumed. “All stakeholders including civil society leaders have agreed to resume the work on Wednesday because suspending it can be dangerous to those infected ... everybody understands the severity of the epidemic.” Congo enters uncharted territory as it faces gravest Ebola challenge to date The Congolese army has launched new operations against the ADF to try to ensure the campaign against Ebola can continue safely. A military spokesman said the militia attacked on Saturday at about and clashed with the army for nearly six hours. The militia long-term aim appeared to be to establish a base close to Beni. After the attack Beni declared a “ville morte”, a period of mourning, until at least Friday. On Monday of Ebola contacts (people at risk of developing the disease and so requiring monitoring) and three suspected cases in and around Beni, could not be reached for disease monitoring, officials said. The town of Oïcha, which is almost entirely surrounded by territory held by the ADF, has two confirmed cases of the virus and one probable case. Pockets of “reluctance, refusal and resistance” to accept vaccination were generating many of the new cases, Salama said. Some people were fleeing into the forest to escape Ebola follow-up treatment and checks, sometimes moving hundreds of miles. Uganda , to the east, is now facing an imminent threat, and social media posts were conflating Ebola with criticism of the DRC government and the UN and a range of conspiracy theories, a development that could put health workers at risk. The DRC, whose heavily forested interior makes it a natural home for Ebola, is at the forefront of a global campaign to combat the disease. The biggest recorded outbreak of Ebola killed an estimated people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, from to The disease was first seen near the northern Ebola river in DRC in the It has twice reached Kinshasa but, on both occasions, was contained.",703,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/drc-resumes-battle-against-ebola-after-militia-attack
53,"Emmanuel Macron will offer honours and a financial support package to the families of Algerians who aided French troops in the war of independence, as part of a wider policy of confronting his country colonial legacy in north Africa . Earlier this month, the French president took the historic step of acknowledging for the first time that France carried out systematic torture during the conflict. Macron – the first French president born after the Algerian conflict – has turned his attention to the Algerians known as “harkis”, a loaded and often pejorative term for the Algerian Muslims who helped the French in the brutal eight-year independence war and faced discrimination and poverty in France . 'My father was tortured and murdered in Algeria. At last France has admitted it' Macron is granting national honours to more than former fighters and those who have campaigned for recognition for the harkis as well as a support package designed largely to help their descendants, who still face marginalisation and poverty. After a peace accord granted Algerian independence in March about Algerian loyalists were allowed into France. There, they were often kept in camps behind barbed wire and suffered discrimination, marginalisation and poverty that has lasted across generations. Tens of thousands more were left behind in Algeria and faced reprisals. The fate of the harkis in France and their descendants, who number hundreds of thousands, remains a highly sensitive issue in Paris, acting as a reminder of its colonial history. In recent years, films and novels have tackled the issue of discrimination against harkis. In a bestselling novel last year, The Art of Losing , the writer Alice Zeniter tackled the assumptions in France around the term “harkis” and highlighted the haphazard and uncertain ways a person might pick a side in a conflict as brutal as Algeria independence war. Some harkis had previously fought for France in the second world war. Macron acknowledged that the French military instituted a “system” that facilitated torture as it sought to cling on to its rule in the country. He said the past must be faced with “courage and lucidity”. The French government is to present its package of financial support over four years for descendants of harkis. But concerns persist over whether the support will be sufficient and whether France should go further and offer a full official apology. The Algerian conflict, which has been shrouded in secrecy and denials, is still seen as unresolved in the French collective psyche. Macron is said to view it as a divisive factor that must be addressed. Macron caused controversy during the presidential campaign last year by declaring that France colonisation of Algeria was a “crime against humanity”. He later backtracked on his comments, calling for “neither denial nor repentance” over France colonial history, adding: “We cannot remain trapped in the past.”",473,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/25/macron-faces-up-to-france-algeria-colonial-past-with-40m-euros-harkis-aid
54,"A prominent opposition politician in Rwanda who was among more than prisoners freed this month has vowed to fight on until people in the small central African country can “speak up without fear”. Victoire Ingabire, was arrested in and given a sentence two years later. “I am out of prison to start a new struggle. We want Rwandans to speak up without fear. This is what we are going to focus on in future. If demanding free speech, respect of human rights for everybody in this country makes me go back to prison, then I am prepared for it,” Ingabire said. She was convicted of a terrorist conspiracy to undermine the government and downplaying Rwanda genocide but says the charges were a fabrication and politically motivated. “It good that I am out of prison,” Ingabire, who leads the FDU-Inkingi opposition party, said. “It appears that the government has finally realised it can work with us. This is good.” Kizito Mihigo, a gospel singer jailed after recording a song critical of the authorities, was also freed after serving a third of a sentence. Supporters said the real reason for Ingabire detention was the former lawyer criticism of the government before the presidential election. There was no official explanation given for President Paul Kagame decision to pardon such a high-profile figure, though he told parliamentarians last week that suggestions he had given way to “foreign pressure” were wrong. Kagame has won international praise for the stability and economic development he has brought to Rwanda since the genocide, when an estimated people were killed, but he has also been accused of running an authoritarian, one-party state. The former soldier won a landslide victory last year , securing a third term in office with of the vote. His ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front remains unchallenged, and has developed substantial economic interests. Kagame warned the released prisoners to be careful. “If you are not careful you can find yourself back in prison or back abroad on the streets. This Rwanda as it is now, we have learnt a lot from its history. If you are wise, you better be humble and work together with others in cooperation,” he said. Ingabire, who returned from Europe to contest elections in said she would fight to free other prisoners, particularly Diane Rwigara , an activist who tried to stand in the elections. Rwigara, was disqualified from running on technical grounds and then arrested on accusations of forgery and inciting insurrection. She denies the allegations but remains in detention. “Having political prisoners in jail taints the image of this country,” Ingabire said. “When all these political prisoners like Diane Rwigara are out, it a good thing in a country said to be promoting women rights,” she said. Ingabire said she was released because she was innocent. Despite some discontent over unemployment and other domestic issues, and a controversial reputation overseas, Kagame appears to be genuinely popular in Rwanda, which has had some of the fastest economic growth rates in Africa and has become known for its stability in a deeply troubled region. However opposition activists, many in exile, say he runs a “police state”, jailing journalists and assassinating dissidents, even overseas.

55,"Rafiki, an acclaimed film portraying a lesbian romance that was, until Friday, banned in its home country Kenya , showed on Sunday to a cheering full house audience in Nairobi. Nairobi residents will be able to watch Rafiki during daytime-only screenings at the Prestige Cinema in the capital for a week after a judge on Friday temporarily lifted a ban on the film, making it eligible to be entered for an Oscar. Rafiki means “friend” in Swahili. To qualify as Kenya entry in the best foreign language film category at the Academy Awards, Rafiki had to be released in the east African country. Kenya briefly lifts ban on gay film to allow for Oscar submission The court ruling delighted the film-makers but angered the Kenya Film Classification Board, which banned the movie in April on the grounds that it promotes homosexuality, which is a criminal offence under a colonial-era law. In May, Rafiki premiered at Cannes, the first Kenyan film to be selected by the prestigious festival. Critics hailed it as a “sweet” romance about two young women who live in the same Nairobi housing estate. After Friday court decision on Friday, the Kenyan censor said it still considered Rafiki morally subversive. That did not stop young Kenyans from turning out on Sunday afternoon to view the film, which the cinema showed on an additional screen after more than people arrived. Vicky, a Nairobi photographer, came with her braided hair wrapped in a rainbow coloured scarf and said she was part of the LGBT community though declined to give her surname. “This week means so much to so many people,” she said. “People can see themselves on screen and they can know that it is OK to express themselves in that way,” she said. As Rafiki played and the audience in the two packed theatres cheered and clapped, Vicky said she could relate to many of the film topics, and with the two lesbian protagonists struggling with homophobia among their friends, family, and church. Kenyan rights activists are fighting to decriminalise gay sex, a step taken in India earlier this month , raising hopes among gay rights proponents in African countries. However, Vicky said that once the screening was over and she left the cinema, she would not dare wearing her rainbow scarf. “This feels like a safe space. But the second I leave this [cinema], I don’t want anyone to see my face like that. Not because I’m scared that I am not a normal person, but because I am scared of expressing myself that way. So much judgment comes with it.”",433,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/23/cinemagoers-celebrate-at-kenyan-screening-of-banned-lesbian-drama-film-rafiki
56,"Indonesia has accused Vanuatu of challenging “friendly relations” between the two countries and supporting separatist movements, after it offered support to West Papua at the United Nations. Vanuatu has long been a supporter of the rights of West Papuans in their movement for independence from Indonesia . On Monday Indonesia used its second right of reply at the UN general assembly to mount an excoriating attack on Vanuatu over its support for West Papuan self-determination, calling it “clueless”. “Although being disguised with flowery human rights concern, Vanuatu sole intention and action are directly challenging the internationally agreed principles of friendly relations between states, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” said the Indonesian representative, Aloysius Selwas Taborat. Indonesia releases people arrested at West Papua university Taborat said Vanuatu repeatedly supported separatist movements and he questioned its behaviour as “an internationally law abiding” nation. “This inexcusable support to separatist individuals is clearly shown by the inclusion by Vanuatu of a number of persons with serious criminal records and a separatist agenda in their delegation to the UN.” Taborat said the people of Papua had “once and for all reaffirmed Papua is an irrevocable part of Indonesia” and that it was “final, irreversible and permanent”, referring to the UN resolution that noted the so-called Act of Free Choice. Many West Papuans consider the move an illegal annexation by Indonesia and a separatist insurgency has run for decades. The controversial referendum, which saw hand-picked individuals vote to remain with Indonesia, is repeatedly dismissed as not being either representative or a free vote. Vanuatu prime minister, Charlot Salwai, who has long supported West Papuan self-determination – had last week called for the Human Rights Council to investigate human rights abuses in the region – claims Indonesia denies. West Papuan activists are routinely arrested and jailed , and there are frequent allegations against Indonesian forces of violence , extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of protesters. Verified information is difficult to obtain as Indonesia does not allow the free movement of press in the region. Last week the Tuvalu prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, also gave support to West Papuans at the general assembly, calling for recognition of West Papuans and engagement “to find lasting solutions to their struggles”. Indonesian forces detain dozens at West Papua university Hilda Heine, the president of the Marshall Islands, said the recent Pacific Islands Forum had given support for the “constructive engagement” by forum countries with Indonesia on elections and human rights in West Papua. “Decolonisation and human rights are both important issues in the Pacific islands region,” she said. Indonesia vice-president, Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, did not name Vanuatu in his first response but labelled it an “act of hostility” that had “no place in the UN system” and was a violation of UN principles. “Indonesia will not let any country undermine its territorial integrity,” he said. “Like any other sovereign country, Indonesia will firmly defend its territorial integrity.” Last September a banned petition calling for a free vote , signed by West Papuans and smuggled out of the region, was delivered to the UN decolonisation committee, which monitors progress towards decolonisation and independent rule.

Indonesia tsunami: bodies discovered inside church as desperation mounts – live On Tuesday the official death toll from the disaster rose to according to disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. It is still expected to climb steeply in the coming days. Signs propped along roads in Sulawesi read “We Need Food” and “We Need Support”, while children begged for cash in the streets. Queues for fuel, which has almost run out in the area, were miles long and the national police and hundreds of troops were deployed to guard petrol stations and food shops. Around people have been displaced by the twin disaster, with many still trying to escape the devastated region. Over people flocked to Palu airport on Monday, trying to board military aircraft or one of the few commercial flights leaving the airport, which has suffered severe damage. Video footage showed crowds screaming in anger because they were not able to get on a military plane. “We have not eaten for three days,” one woman yelled. “We just want to be safe.” Sabtarina Dwi Febriyanti, a programme manager with charity World Vision on the ground in Palu, described how security was becoming an increasing concern. “There is chaos because there is not enough supplies of food and clean water and medicine and people are getting more and more frustrated,” she said. “People have begun robbing the shops just to survive and people keep hijacking the trucks bringing in the aid. I keep seeing people screaming: ‘I need to survive, I need to survive.’ So it makes the situation here uncomfortable and security is a big problem, especially because there over prisoners on the loose. Things are just getting worse; it is worrying.” Desperation exploded into anger in Donggala, the town closest to the epicentre of the massive earthquake and tsunami, with residents begging Indonesia president to help them as hungry survivors crawled into stores and grabbed boxes of food. “Pay attention to Donggala, Mr Jokowi. Pay attention to Donggala,” yelled one resident in footage broadcast on local television, referring to president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. “There are still a lot of unattended villages here.” Most of the attention so far has focused on the biggest affected city, Palu. Donggala and other outlying areas have received little assistance largely due to impassable roads and many have been forced to take food from stores. “Everyone is hungry and they want to eat after several days of not eating,” said Donggala administration head Kasman Lassa. “We have anticipated it by providing food, rice, but it was not enough. There are many people here. So, on this issue, we cannot pressure them to hold much longer.” On Monday, in Ulujadi district in western Palu, residents deprived of food and water blocked roads to intercept trucks carrying food supplies, with police officers reportedly unable to restrain the crowds. In Tawaeli district in central Palu, crowds gathered at the port to intercept government aid arriving on boats. The process began on Monday of burying the bodies, which had begun piling up in the local army hospital, in a mass grave measuring long. Photos were taken of the corpses before they were buried so they could be identified by relatives. Sutopo admitted that search teams were still struggling to reach and evacuate the worst hit areas in Sulawesi. Many in Palu complained bitterly at the failure of rescue teams, overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis, to make it to their neighborhood in time. A major problem is that the earthquake fractured and destroyed many of the roads, leaving some areas isolated and inaccessible. Heavy equipment needed for the rescue operations only began arriving on Monday. Many people are also believed to still be trapped under shattered houses in Palu Balaroa neighborhood, where the earthquake caused the ground to heave up and down violently “I and about other people in Balaroa were able to save ourselves by riding on a mound of soil which was getting higher and higher,” resident Siti Hajat told MetroTV, adding her house was destroyed. President Joko Widodo urged survivors to be patient as they wait for aid to be distributed upon arriving in Palu.

Indonesia tsunami: desperation turns to anger as food and water run out Updated at BST Before and after satellite images show the devastating impact of the earthquake and tsunami on parts of Sulawesi. Desperation exploded into anger Tuesday in Donggala, the town closest to the epicenter of the massive earthquake and tsunami, with residents begging Indonesia president to help them as hungry survivors crawled into stores and grabbed boxes of food. “Pay attention to Donggala, Mr. Jokowi. Pay attention to Donggala,” yelled one resident in footage broadcast on local television, referring to President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. “There are still a lot of unattended villages here.” Most of the attention so far has focused on the biggest affected city, Palu, home to most of the more than confirmed deaths, a number expected to rise as more areas are reached. Donggala and other outlying areas have received little assistance largely due to impassable roads. Donggala administration head Kasman Lassa said residents should take only food staples from shops. “Everyone is hungry and they want to eat after several days of not eating,” Lassa said. “We have anticipated it by providing food, rice, but it was not enough. There are many people here. So, on this issue, we cannot pressure them to hold much longer.” ‘Hero’ air traffic controller body flown out of Makassar The body of an air traffic controller, lauded as a hero for his actions during the earthquake, has been taken to a helicopter to be flown out of Makassar. Anthonius Gunawan Agung, was the only person left in the control tower when the earthquake struck, his colleagues having left when the tower began to sway and crack. Agung remained to make sure a plane, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely. Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia said the decision cost him his life, but potentially saved hundreds of others. Residents in the disaster-devastated Indonesian city of Donggala say people there are hungry and the central government must urgently get aid there. The city was among those hit in last week earthquake and tsunami, but aid has been slow to arrive due to the difficulty in reaching it. Survivors in Donggala say they worry they have been forgotten as attention has been focused on the city of Palu, which has been easier to reach. With supplies running out, local administrator Kasman Lassa says people were taking food and other essentials from shops Tuesday. Lassa told the Associated Press: “Everyone is hungry and they want to eat after several days of not eating.” He says people going into shops “should take only cake, bread, rice. Do not take chairs, or television. Again, for cake, bread, rice, they can take it. The store owner also allows them to take food.” We have produced a visual guide which shows where the earthquake occurred and some of the worst-affected areas. People have been sharing photographs and details of missing family members online. Many are still believed to be missing – trapped under the rubble of houses and buildings or under mud. Indonesian President Joko Widodo authorised the acceptance of international help, Nugroho said, adding that generators, heavy equipment and tents were among the most-needed items. The European Union and countries have offered assistance, including the United States, Australia and China, he said. “We will send food today, as much as possible with several aircraft,” Widodo told reporters in the capital, Jakarta, adding that a supply of fuel was also set to arrive. Yesterday about residents flocked to Palu airport, trying to board military aircraft or one of the few commercial flights using the facility only partially operating due to damage, reports the Associated Press. Video showed some of them screaming in anger because they were not able to get on a departing military plane. “We have not eaten for three days!” one woman yelled. “We just want to be safe!” Some heartbreaking stories are coming out from Palu, the city of more than people that was devastated by the earthquake and tsunami on Friday. Among the areas of Palu hardest hit are the Balaroa and Petobo neighbourhoods. In Petobo, the quake caused loose, wet soil to liquefy, creating a thick, heavy mud that caused massive damage. It is believed there are still hundreds of victims buried in the mud in Petobo. Edi Setiawan said he and his neighbours rescued children and adults, including a pregnant woman in Petobo. His sister and father, however, did not survive, he told the Associated Press. “My sister was found embracing her father,” he said. “My mother was able to survive after struggling against the mud and being rescued by villagers.” Many people were believed trapped under shattered houses in Palu Balaroa neighborhood, where the earthquake caused the ground to heave up and down violently, said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. “I and about other people in Balaroa were able to save ourselves by riding on a mound of soil which was getting higher and higher,” resident Siti Hajat told MetroTV, adding her house was destroyed. Residents who found loved ones alive and dead over the weekend expressed frustration that it took rescue teams until Monday to reach Petobo. Katharine Murphy Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking now in Perth and has been asked about whether Australia will be giving any aid to Indonesia in the wake of Friday earthquake. He said Australia had already provided half a million dollars in immediate support through the Red Cross and was looking at providing a “second round of support”, but would not be drawn on what that might look like. “The Australian government has already provided of support immediately through the Indonesian Red Cross, and that to support the most obvious emergency aid needs – tarpaulins, things of that nature,” he said. “Our ambassador has been working closely with the Indonesian government to look at a second round of support, and we’re currently working together with them on that and we’ll have more to say about that when some decisions have been made. “I’ll have more to say once the arrangements have been settled. I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves here. We’re still working some of those details through but once they have been confirmed I will announce them soon.” Updated at BST Sutopo Purwo Nugroho is the spokesperson for the disaster agency (BNBP) and the official face of the government response to the disaster. He was also the spokesperson for the BNBP during the Lombok earthquake in August that killed more than people. While Sutopo normal role is to share information about disasters and the relief efforts, he has tweeted this morning on a more personal note, revealing that he has stage four lung cancer. He wrote that despite the cancer, “I still try to serve the media and society well” and encouraged others with cancer not to be discouraged and to think about “how much we can help others”. He also posted cartoon showing himself hooked up to a drip, while a volcano explodes, and an earthquake and a tsunami occur in the background. What we know so far The search continues for thousands of people who are believed to be trapped under rubble after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday morning, causing a tsunami and around aftershocks. The death toll is still at but is expected to rise sharply as rescue efforts continue. Roughly people have been displaced by the earthquake. There have been reports of looting as aid and supplies struggle to reach the affected areas and Palu faces its fifth day with limited power and clean water supplies. Part of the reason for the slow delivery of supplies to Palu is due to the damage to the airport , where only one runway is operational. On Monday, the airport was forced to close temporarily as hundreds of people flocked to the airport to beg the military to evacuate them or give them food. The bodies of students were found in a church on Tuesday. The group were killed when a mudslide engulfed the church in which they were meeting. The bodies of some of the victims have been buried in a mass grave near Palu . The grave has space for more than people. There is a major shortage of fuel in the region . Queues at petrol stations around Palu reportedly stretch for kilometres. The International Committee of Red Cross says of its aid workers are on the ground in the area. More than prisoners are missing from a local jails in the area. The devastation in pictures Updated at BST Desperation is visible everywhere in areas heavily damaged by an earthquake and tsunami, four days after the disaster devastated parts of Indonesia central Sulawesi island. Signs propped along roads read “We Need Food” and “We Need Support,” while traffic was snarled by people waiting for fuel, reports the Associated Press. What is the Australian government doing to assist? A reader of the liveblog has emailed in wanting to know what the Australian government is doing to aid the Indonesian government, given the need for urgent assistance. Christopher Pyne, minister for defence, was on RN Breakfast this morning and was asked this question. He said that he and Marise Payne, minister for foreign affairs, had reached out to their counterparts in Indonesia and offered Australia assistance and were waiting to hear from the Indonesian government how they could best help in the aftermath of the disaster. He told Fran Kelly: My understanding is the Indonesians are assessing what support they may require, and we stand ready to assist them once they let us know exactly what they need. So the offer is there, they are aware of it, they haven’t rejected it, they are just making their own assessment about what they might need and then they’ll come to us and I’m sure we’ll be assisting as soon as possible. Pyne said they had vessels ready to sail to Sulawesi and aircraft that could go as well. But that “it would be wise” to wait until the Indonesians told them how they could assist. “I’m sure they will reach out to us if they want to.” Thanks to the reader for the question and a reminder that if there anything you want to the blog to address, feel free to drop me a line on kate.lyons@theguardian.com or tweet me @mskatelyons Updated at BST of Newest Oldest Indonesia Tsunamis Asia Pacific Natural disasters and extreme weather",1953,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/oct/02/indonesia-tsunami-palu-aid-food-shortages-video-death-toll-sulawesi

The bodies of some of the victims have been buried in a mass grave near Palu. The grave has space for more than people. At least people wounded in the disaster are being treated in hospital. More than have been forced from their homes. Electricity is still down in the affected region, hampering rescue efforts, and there is a major shortage of fuel. Queues at petrol stations around Palu reportedly stretch for kilometres. The International Committee of Red Cross says of its aid workers are on the ground in the area. Thousands of people have tried to flee Palu via the city airport. Only one flight a day is due to leave. More than prisoners are missing from a local jails in the area. Here video of the scenes at Palu airport as thousands of people try to get a flight out. Local television said around residents had flocked to the Palu airport trying to get out, AP reports. Footage showed some people screaming in anger because they were not able to board departing military aircraft. The airport has resumed only some commercial flights. “We have not eaten for three days!” one woman yelled. “We just want to be safe!” In his press conference disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said conditions in the Petobo neighbuorhood of Palu city were particularly bad because the quake caused a phenomenon called liquefaction , AP reports. This occurs when loose water-filled soil near the surface loses its strength and collapses. Nugroho said authorities estimate that “there are still hundreds of victims buried in mud” in the area. Villagers who pulled out loved ones alive and dead over the weekend expressed frustration that rescue teams had only reached Petobo on Monday. On Sunday Sutopo tweeted terrifying video purporting to show liquefaction taking place in the aftermath of the earthquake. Other videos claiming to the show the phenomenon have also emerged. Updated at BST Lian Gogali, one of the first aid workers to reach the devastated district of Donggala north of Palu, says the homes of hundreds of people have been destroyed. She tweeted an image of an area covered in debris that she said was home to families. Reuters said she reached the area by motorcycle. She told the agency that hundreds of people are facing a lack of food and medicine were trying to get out, but evacuation teams had yet to arrive and roads were blocked. Aid supplies that have reached the stricken areas are a “drop in the bucket” of what required, the International Federation of the Red Cross has warned. Jan Gelfand, head of the IFRC country cluster support office in Jakarta, said the agency now had aid workers on the ground. Speaking to the the BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme he said: We have field kitchens we have things coming in by sea. We have water tankers coming in, but this is a drop in the bucket to what the need is. So we are having to find very creative ways to get there. We don’t even know what some of the damage is in the areas that are more remote. Our teams took to hours to get in and so it is going to be a while before even the assessment is done before we get a true picture of the situation. We are doing what we can. Things are opening up a little bit more but the need is great. The event is very serious and this is a longterm process. Updated at BST As Hannah mentioned earlier fuel shortages are hampering rescue efforts . Queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretch for kilometres, according to Reuters. Matthew Weaver Distressing images and descriptions have emerged of victims in body bags being buried in a mass grave in Poboya in the hills above Palu.

Authorities are desperate to stave off any disease outbreak caused by decomposing bodies, some now are riddled with maggots. Three trucks arrived stacked with corpses wrapped in orange, yellow and black bags, an AFP reporter on the scene saw. One-by-one they were dragged into the grave as excavators poured soil on top. AP quoted local army commander Tiopan Aritonang as saying that bodies for the grave would be brought from one hospital alone. It added: The trench dug in Palu was meters by meters feet by feet) and can be enlarged if needed, said Willem Rampangilei, chief of Indonesia National Disaster Mitigation Agency. “This must be done as soon as possible for health and religious reasons,” he said. Indonesia is majority Muslim, and religious custom calls for burials soon after death, typically within one day. Local military spokesman Mohammad Thorir said the area adjacent to a public cemetery can hold bodies. All of the victims, coming from local hospitals, have been photographed to help families locate where their relatives were buried. Video footage showed residents walking from body bag to body bag, opening the tops to check to see if they could identify faces. What we know so far The death toll has risen to However, this still doesn’t account for some of the worst hit areas in the region, such as the city of Donggala and the Balaroa region, where an entire housing estate home to people sunk into the ground. Rescue teams have not been able to reach these areas yet to begin evacuations and body counts. Some people have been hospitalised and more than have been displaced. Electricity is still down in the affected region, hampering rescue efforts, and there is a major shortage of fuel. Teams began work burying the bodies in mass graves in the hills above Palu to prevent the spread of disease. A long grave has been dug in preparation for bodies. Palu airport will be open for a single flight a day to another area of Sulawesi. prisoners are now missing from local jails. Updated at BST The official death toll did not increase as much as some had expected, mainly because some of the worst hit areas have still yet to be accessed by rescuers. The heavy machinery needed to lift up and uncover bodies from the rubble is also only just arriving into the area.

61,"Authorities in Indonesia have begun mass burials for victims of the earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, as relatives of the missing combed through body bags for their loved ones and the search for survivors intensified. The death toll from the disaster rose only slightly on Monday, to due to difficulties in reaching the areas worst affected by the quake, while the lack of heavy machinery made it difficult to retrieve corpses from the rubble. The casualties are still expected to reach into the thousands in the coming days. At Poboya, in the hills above Palu, volunteers dug a mass grave and began filling it with hundreds of bodies in bags. Instructions were given to prepare for up to victims to be buried, in order to stave off the spread of disease. More than bodies were taken to the mass grave from one hospital alone. Willem Rampangilei, the head of the national disaster agency, said the mass burials “must be done as soon as possible for health and religious reasons”. The quake struck on Friday, sparking a tsunami that ripped apart the coastline at Palu, on the island of Sulawesi. The quake struck as evening prayers were about to begin in the Muslim-majority country. A festival was also taking place on the beach in Palu. Jan Gelfand, the head of the Red Cross office in Jakarta, said rescue teams were having to find “creative ways” to try to reach victims in remote areas. It had dispatched water tankers to the coastal area, but she said this was “a drop in the bucket to what the need is”. “Our teams took to hours to get in and so it is going to be a while before even the assessment is done before we get a true picture of the situation,” said Gelfand. The disaster agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said conditions in the Petobo neighbourhood of Palu were particularly bad because the quake caused a phenomenon called liquefaction, when loose, water-filled soil near the surface loses its strength and collapses, causing all structures built on it to collapse. “There are still hundreds of victims buried in mud,” Sutopo told reporters on Monday. Rescuers were also struggling to reach Balaroa, where the earthquake has caused a housing estate, which was home to people, to collapse and sink five metres into the ground. In the absence of rescue teams, locals were having to pull the dead bodies from the mud and a village civic leader, Rahmatsyah, said that people have been confirmed dead, based on citizen reports”. He told MetroTV: “It is estimated that there are still many more victims. Hundreds and even thousands of people are buried in debris which we cannot lift.” Among those trapped in the ruins of the housing estate was Nurul Istikharah. Most of her body had been trapped in deep mud and concrete for hours, with only her head visible. The body of her mother, Risni, who died in the collapse, was trapped next to her. Yusuf, Nurul father, has sat by her side since he found her alive. He told Tirto news website: “Everything went fast. The land collapsed instantly. I found my daughter was buried under the ruins and puddle.” On Sunday night, the Central Sulawesi administration declared a state of emergency. Sutopo said this would enable “both the regional and national government to mobilise personnel, logistics, equipment as well as money to fulfil the needs of the affected area and people.” 'Bodies everywhere': Indonesia rescue efforts focus on Palu Sutopo confirmed there would be no electricity in Palu and the nearby town of Donggala for at least another three days, while drinking water and fuel were running out. There was limited access to heavy equipment, so the search for people trapped in the rubble was mostly being carried out by hand. Desperate survivors, now facing a third night sleeping outdoors, queued for fuel and food. There was some looting of shops. Thousands gathered at Palu airport in a desperate attempt to get a flight out. “We have not eaten for three days,” one woman yelled. “We just want to be safe.” Sri Puguh Budi Utami, Indonesia prisons chief, said that inmates have escaped from jails which were damaged in the quake, including those from the Donggala detention centre which was set on fire and all inmates are now on the run. Indonesia president, Joko Widodo, promised more supplies. “We will send as much food as possible with Hercules aircraft, there are several aircraft carrying food from Jakarta,” he said on Monday. “We also expect fuel supplies to enter Palu.”",768,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/01/indonesia-tsunami-mass-burials-begin-amid-desperate-search-for-survivors
62,"An annual debate in the Netherlands about the Christmas season practice of white people blackening their faces, colouring their lips red and donning wigs to play Zwarte Piet, a sidekick to Saint Nicholas, has this year descended into street brawls, vandalism and a conviction for inciting racial hatred. The characterisation of Zwarte Piet – or Black Pete – has divided Dutch society in recent years. In the UN stepped in to declare it was a “vestige of slavery”. Some major cities, including Amsterdam and The Hague, have refashioned Zwarte Piet image, or done away with him altogether, to avoid accusations of racism. Others, however, continue to believe the character portrayal to be a harmless tradition. In a survey of of the Dutch municipalities, said they would be sticking with the traditional image in The blackened face is often explained away in those cases as a consequence of Zwarte Piet climbing sooty chimneys while helping Saint Nicholas deliver presents at a feast on the evening of December. Opponents say that Zwarte Piet is instead a reference to slavery. The difference of opinion has turned particularly ugly this year, however, with the involvement of the extreme right apparently helping to push local disputes into violence and vigilantism. Last weekend, buses filled with those opposed to the traditional portrayal of Zwarte Piet were blocked on the motorway on their way to protest at an official “Sinterklaas arrival”, the point at which Saint Nicholas arrives in town with his sidekick to mark the start of the festive season. Around people, many thought to be members of extreme-right nationalist organisations, halted the convoy of demonstrators on the motorway as they were about to make a legal protest in Dokkum, in the north of the country. Black Pete is just a bit of fun for the Netherlands, right? Wrong | Samira bin Sharifu The Dutch home affairs minister, Raymond Knops, responded by calling for pro-Zwarte Piet protesters to abide by the law. “I understand the emotions on this subject, but I cannot approve of people stopping everything on a highway,” he said. “Everyone must abide by the law, including these people.” In a separate incident, this week members of an “action group for the preservation of Zwarte Piet” invaded a primary school just before the end of the school day, dressed in the contentious garb, and handed out flyers and stickers.

The hajj , a journey every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must perform once in a lifetime, can be a profound experience. It is also big business for Saudi Arabia . The hajj and the year-round lesser pilgrimage, umrah, generate billions of dollars in revenues from worshippers’ lodging, transport, gifts, food and fees. The new rail link was built by a Spanish-led consortium and financed by the kingdom sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. It halves travel time between Mecca, the spiritual heart of Islam, and Medina, its second most sacred site. Project manager Mohammed Fallatah said the train would offer fast and reliable transportation to pilgrims as well as Saudis and foreign residents. “The traveller will be comfortable. He can read books or magazines or enjoy watching the screens in business class, have a coffee or a light meal,” he said before Tuesday ceremony. The authorities hope the train will also stimulate growth of King Abdullah Economic City, a massive business zone that was initiated under the previous ruler but remains relatively empty.

72,"Peru president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has pardoned the jailed former autocrat Alberto Fujimori in a Christmas Eve announcement that has sparked protests across the country. The president, who last week survived a vote to force him out of office, said in a statement on Sunday night that he had “decided to concede a humanitarian pardon to Mr Alberto Fujimori”. “A medical panel has determined Mr Fujimori has a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease and the jail conditions present a grave risk to his life and health,” it read. The move comes a day after Fujimori, who is serving a sentence for corruption and human rights crimes, was rushed to hospital on Saturday after suffering a severe drop in blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm. His doctor said he could die. Peru president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski survives bid to impeach him Alberto Fujimori, who governed Peru from to is the figurehead of the party which dominates Peru Congress and a deeply divisive figure in the country. He was jailed in for authorising death squads, overseeing rampant corruption and vote-rigging. The writing was on the wall when Kuczysnki was saved from impeachment late on Thursday night by Fujimori son Kenji, a congressman who led a rebel faction of the majority Fuerza Popular opposition party – led by his older sister Keiko – in voting against ousting him from office for lying about links to the Brazilian firm Odebrecht, which is at the centre of Latin America biggest corruption scandal . Kenji Fujimori thanked Kuczynski in a tweet for his “noble and magnanimous gesture” on behalf of the Fujimori family, adding “we are eternally grateful to you”. “It a night of joy and happiness,” said Keiko Fujimori, speaking outside the hospital where he father was being treated. “It been more than years of waiting with my father without liberty. Finally justice has done.” Not so for Gisela Ortiz, the sister of one of the victims of a death squad massacre for which Fujimori was convicted, who said Kuczynski had robbed them of “tranquility and right to justice when handing out this undeserved pardon to Fujimori”. “We haven’t had Christmas for years, just painful absences. Carry that with you today,” she tweeted. Pedro Cateriano, a former prime minister, called it an “act of treason to democracy and human rights”, adding “the pardon of the dictator is not a humanitarian act, it has been a infamous political pact”. The news provoked mixed reactions on the night when Peruvians celebrate Christmas. Angry protesters gathered in Lima Plaza San Martín, the place where marches traditionally begin, while TV images showed Fujimori supporters cheering the decision outside the hospital where he was rushed on Saturday night. Reacting to the news, Jo-Marie Burt, senior fellow with the Washington Office on Latin America , said Kuczynski, popularly known as PPK, had “bartered his political survival for the dictator freedom”. “PPK has long intimated that he would pardon Fujimori. But to do it in this way – after just barely surviving impeachment, on Christmas Eve – is an incredible show of disrespect to the victims of Fujimorismo,” she told the Guardian. “This is going to be explosive.” At least two lawmakers from PPK party have resigned in protest. Ministerial resignations are expected. The former strongman leader looms large over present-day Peru. The hard-right populist political movement he began in the continues under the leadership of his daughter Keiko Fujimori who commands an absolute majority in Peru legislature despite an apparent split with her younger brother Kenji. She has twice narrowly lost presidential elections in and the second time by the narrowest of margins to Kuczynski . Kuczynski decision is even more controversial because he owes his victory in to support from anti-Fujimori campaigners in the election runoff. Verónika Mendoza, a leftist candidate who came third in the race, called on her supporters to vote for PPK in order to stave off the possible return for the Fujimori dynasty. She did so while decrying the former Wall Street banker as a lobbyist but the lesser of two evils. But Kuczynski has been publicly mulling the idea for much of the year. The former World Bank official, who is the same age as Fujimori, insisted he cannot allow him to die in prison. “A reprieve is something humanitarian. It is not a pardon,” he has said. Peruvians remain bitterly divided over Fujimori legacy. His supporters credit him with laying the foundations of the country robust, investor-friendly economy after it was sunk by massive hyperinflation. His supporters say he pacified the country, defeating the brutal Maoist Shining Path movement. He remained popular even when he dissolved Congress in April and in spite of his government violent repression. New highways in remote Amazon risk ‘ethnocide’, say Peruvians But Peruvians eventually tired of the regime rampant corruption, and after a rigged election in Fujimori fled to Japan.

I don’t think Keiko wants her father out of prison. I think Kenji does. I think PPK has considered using the pardon to divide Fujimorismo and make a pact with Kenji,” he told the Guardian. “If Keiko has total control of the party, she is the next candidate and quite possibly the next president if things stay the way they are.

73,"n the darkest days of Peru internal conflict, Melissa Alfaro hoped to transform her country through journalism. At she got her first full-time job at the left-leaning weekly Cambio, but her dreams were cut short as the Peruvian state under the then president, Alberto Fujimori, fought terror with terror. Alfaro was returning to the magazine office after a morning covering congress on Thursday October when she stopped off to pick up the mail from the porter. Moments later her colleagues heard an explosion. Thousands march in Lima in protest over pardon for former Peru president “They found her dead. She had opened a letter bomb which had blown up in her face. It destroyed her,” recalls her mother Norma Méndez, weeping at the memory. An investigation found that the explosive gel used in the bomb was used exclusively by the Peruvian military and matched the material used in a string of attacks on leftwing figures they accused of sympathising with rebels. But Méndez holds one man responsible for her daughter murder: Fujimori. Like many others in Peru, she was forced to relive her trauma when the country current president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, granted a humanitarian pardon for the former strongman. The Christmas Eve announcement has prompted a wave of outrage: tens of thousands marched in Lima against the pardon under which Fujimori, was released less than halfway through a sentence for corruption and authorising death squads. Many Peruvians believe Fujimori should never have been pardoned, not just because of the gravity of the crimes for which he was convicted but because of the many more alleged human rights violations for which he never faced trial – and probably never will. “There are many cases linked to Fujimori anti-subversive policy which have not been considered – and for which Fujimori would have responsibility as an indirect perpetrator,” said human rights lawyer Gloria Cano. Fujimori fled to Japan in amid growing evidence of rigged elections and rampant graft, but he was arrested during a trip to Chile in and extradited two years later to face trial. Finally, Méndez believed she would get justice for her daughter murder. But Fujimori could only be tried for the cases linked to his extradition, including the two most notorious death squad killings : the Barrios Altos massacre in which people including an eight-year-old child were shot, and the kidnap and murder of nine university students and their professor. Fujimori pardon – seen by many as a backroom deal struck to protect Kuczynski from impeachment on corruption charges – consisted of a humanitarian pardon on health grounds and a presidential pardon which, in theory, lifts all possibilities for future prosecution. But Fujimori could face a further human rights case due to a technicality, said Cano, who represents the families of six farmers who were tortured and killed in Pativilca, a rural village, in The Pativilca case was opened in February after Chile supreme court added the case to its extradition file. It must stay open for months, raising the possibility that a judge could require Fujimori to attend a hearing – and thus revoke the presidential pardon. Fujimori pardon has no precedent for the international court of human rights, said Diego García-Sayán, a former justice minister. “It is the first time someone convicted of grave human rights violations has been granted a humanitarian pardon in the more than years of the court existence,” he said. For Méndez, Kuczynski pardon was an “act of treason”. The only person charged over her daughter murder was an army captain who admitted in to preparing the letter bombs, but was later released when the case did not come to trial. So although Fujimori was never tried for her daughter murder, his sentencing in brought her “some comfort”, she said. “Now this New Year feels like all over again,” she said. “We lived those years [of Fujimori government] in terror. If you were against the government you were a terrorist,” says Méndez. After her daughter murder, troops would park outside her family home and ask neighbours where they lived, she said. To make matters worse, as more evidence of death squad killings under his command emerged, Fujimori pushed through an amnesty law in which exempted military personnel from imprisonment or prosecution over human rights crimes during the preceding years. Now Méndez cradles a placard which she carried at last week the protest, bearing a black and white photo of her daughter. “Before she left the house that day she told me: ‘ Mamá , I will always be with you.’”",758,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/03/peru-alberto-fujimori-pardon-victims-state-terror-protests

The public opprobrium was directed at Peru president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who granted the pardon on health grounds on Christmas Eve to lift the sentence, Fujimori, had been serving for corruption and authorising death squad killings. Public indignation threatens to push Kuczynski beleaguered government into a political crisis as he reshuffles his cabinet and seeks to forge a new alliance with the majority opposition party led by Fujimori daughter Keiko. “The president has lost all legitimacy,” said Maria Isabel Cedano, a feminist campaigner who supported Kuczynski, known as PPK, in Peru presidential runoff to prevent a victory for Keiko Fujimori. “He has betrayed us. He should resign and convene new elections.” Amid the face-painted drummers, workers’ unions, students and feminist collectives wearing traditional Andean embroidered skirts, Kuczynski image was a new addition to the rubber-faced puppet caricatures worn by actors waving bundles of banknotes in the burlesque parade usually reserved for Fujimori and other former leaders tainted with corruption. Marchers wore headbands reading “The pardon is an insult” and carried placards saying “Justice cannot be negotiated” as they chanted “Out, out PPK.” Alberto Fujimori, whose authoritarian leadership in the left an indelible mark on the country, continues to cast a long shadow over modern Peru . His supporters credit him with stamping out the Maoist Shining Path movement and responsibility for Peru economic success while others consider him a corrupt and iron-fisted dictator. Speaking from a hospital bed on Tuesday, Fujimori asked for forgiveness from the Peruvians he said he had “let down”. He thanked Kuczynski for the pardon and pledged to back the president call for national reconciliation. “It was a taunt,” said Rosa Rojas Borda, who lost her eight-year-old son Javier and husband Manuel, in the Barrios Altos massacre , one of two carried out by a military death squad Fujimori was convicted of having created. “He should ask for forgiveness from the relatives of those he had killed. They have a first and last name,” she told the Guardian as she strode at the front of the march with other family members carrying placards bearing black and white photos of their loved ones who were killed in the early “PPK has never invited us – the families of the victims – to visit him, as he has Keiko and Kenji. We’ve asked him three times,” said Carmen Oyague, whose daughter, Dora Oyague Fierro, was one of nine students and a university professor who were abducted and killed in Her niece, Carolina Oyague, said: “You can’t reconcile the country by decree,” referring to a message on Tuesday in which the leader asked young people to leave aside “negative emotions” and “turn the page”. Human rights lawyers in Peru say there are legal grounds to challenge the pardon because it was a political and not a humanitarian decision. Carlos Rivera, a lawyer at the Legal Defence Institute, said Kuczynski issued the pardon as a part of a deal to avoid impeachment on corruption allegations last week. The president has denied wrongdoing. Human rights experts at the UN called the pardon an appalling “slap in the face” to the victims of human rights abuses, adding it was granted on “politically motivated grounds” and was a “major setback for the rule of law in Peru”. Fujimori “guilt is not in question” and he did “not meet the legal requirements for a pardon”, they concluded. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed “deep concern” over the pardon. “The pardon is a major reversal in the consolidation of Peru democracy,” says Paulo Drinot, a senior lecturer in Latin American History at University College London. “PPK has undermined the rule of law for his own political survival.

It was unclear if the opposition-controlled Congress would accept his resignation or proceed with a vote on Thursday to force him from office. Brazil corruption scandal spreads across South America In a televised message to the nation, Kuczynski said he would offer his resignation to avoid being an “obstacle” to the country but continued to deny any wrongdoing. Just months into his five-year mandate, Kuczynski is the first sitting president in Latin America to be forced out due to links to the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which has been at the centre of continent biggest corruption scandal . Kuczynski resigned as lawmakers prepared to vote for the second time in three months whether to oust the leader from office for “permanent moral unfitness” in a plenary session of Congress. He is accused of repeatedly lying about decade-old business ties to the Brazilian firm. But the release on Tuesday night of secretly recorded videos allegedly showing the president supporters attempting to buy political support ended any possibility that Kuczysnki could survive the attempt to force him out. The videos released by Peru biggest opposition party Fuerza Popular allegedly show key allies of the president offering lawmakers a share of public work projects in return for help in defeating a second impeachment vote against Kuczynski. He narrowly survived a previous impeachment motion in December The video clips shown in a news conference feature a government official explaining to a lawmaker how to make easy money from government projects for his region, while congressman Kenji Fujimori, assures him of government protection. In his address on Wednesday, Kuczynski blamed “selectively tendentious” edited recording for giving the impression of vote buying and said “political confrontation had created a climate of ungovernability” which did enormous damage to the country. Government ministers have denied contracts were awarded in exchange for political support and announced they would fire the official. Kenji Fujimori also denied wrongdoing, saying the recordings were a reflection of typical negotiations to get infrastructure projects off the ground. Although Kuczynski, known as PPK, was not directly implicated in the alleged vote buying, his increasingly battered credibility could not survive a further scandal. The Oxford- and Princeton-educated former banker who promised to modernise Peru is the first victim of a unfolding corruption scandal which has implicated most of the country main political players. “The parliamentary majority worked against PPK from day one,” said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at Lima Catholic University. “But he too must take responsibility for his downfall. His business interests, his lack of transparency, his lack of political maneuvering to distance himself from the Odebrecht scandal. “In many ways, he dug his own grave.”",480,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/peru-president-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-resigns-amid-corruption-scandal
76,"Two more opposition MPs have been suspended from the Nauru parliament amid claims the government is trying to avoid scrutiny of a budget that contains Australian funding for asylum seekers. The government of president Baron Waqa is expected to hand down its budget on Thursday. Three opposition MPs were banned from parliament in May amid chaotic scenes that included a police stand-off. Another two – former president Sprent Dabwido and Squire Jeremiah – were suspended on Thursday for behaving in an ""unruly manner"". The pair had opposed the earlier suspensions of Roland Kun, former foreign minister Kieren Keke and Mathew Batsiua. That trio had been booted from parliament for talking to foreign journalists and criticising the government decision to expel the country chief justice, Australian Geoffrey Eames, and the dismissal of its only magistrate, Peter Law, another Australian. Only three non-government MPs are left in the parliament, facing from the government. ""The whole thing has gone pear-shaped,"" Kun said from New Zealand. ""We're pleading for the speaker to save the legislature because the government has already killed the judiciary."" The opposition is unable to seek a supreme court ruling because no chief justice has been appointed to replace Eames. Kun believes the second lot of suspensions is connected to the budget timing. ""There are numerous holes in the budget but we can't put a finger on them until they actually present the paperwork,"" he said. Australia provides a considerable part of the government budget, which it uses to run an immigration detention centre and resettlement program. So far Nauru has resettled refugees on a temporary basis until a third country, expected to be Cambodia, agrees to a deal with Australia. The detention centre accommodates more than asylum seekers. Opposition MPs are concerned that funding for healthcare, education, transport and utilities is going backwards. Kun believes money has been diverted to a fund used to pay cash bonuses to ""selected individuals"". If the budget passed on Thursday, parliament might not sit again until he said.

77,"Nauru has enacted sweeping contempt-of-court laws that make almost any criticism of a case – including in media reporting – a crime, but create exemptions for members of the government. The legislation came into force last month. Anyone accused of the crime would be refused a presumption of bail, alongside those accused of murder or treason, under separate laws that came into force on the same day. Members of the so-called “Nauru , who are facing jail for protesting against government crackdowns on opposition MPs, have expressed concern about the laws. Separately, a Lowy Institute report has warned of Nauru “lurch towards authoritarianism”. Under the Administration of Justice Act, it is now a crime to criticise any party to a case, which could include the government, as it is party to any criminal prosecution. Also outlawed are: criticisms of any witnesses, judicial officers or legal representatives in a pending court matter publishing a judgment of the court “scandalising” a judge or judicial officer “scandalising” or undermining the authority of the courts or justice system “in any manner whatsoever” An online offence applies if it is viewable in Nauru, regardless of where it was published. Penalties are up to two years in jail and fines for individuals, and up to in fines for corporations. It has a statute of limitations. Defences include comments made “in good faith”, or as part of fair and accurate court reporting, or in a legitimate complaint. The government is exempt if it believes it in the public interest or for national security, and MPs are protected by parliamentary privilege. “No servant or agent of the republic shall be convicted of contempt of court for the execution of his or her duties in good faith,” it also said. There are concerns the new laws are targeted at the “Nauru who along with their legal representatives, have frequently criticised the case against them and the actions of the court. Mathew Batsiua, a former justice minister and member of the signalled their legal team would challenge the constitutionality of the laws in pre-trial motions. “They are a chilling and extraordinary attack on the rule of law and democratic freedom, and undermine our right to a fair trial, ” Batsiua said. “Yet again we see this irresponsible government responding to developments in the case by passing new laws and undermining our legal system.” In the long-running case, three of the defendants are currently appealing their increased jail sentences for a protest. Nineteen people – including a former president – were charged over the protest against the government suspension of opposition MPs who criticised the expulsion of high-ranking members of the judiciary from the country. Nauru former president accuses Australia of being complicit in 'political prosecution' John Jeremiah, Job Cecil and Josh Kepae had appealed increases of up to to their sentences when the Nauruan government quietly severed a treaty with Australia that enshrined the status of Australia high court as its highest appeals court. The creation of a local appellate court has been legislated, but it unclear whether it is operational. A Lowy Institute report on the state of governance in the Pacific Islands region found Nauru had “lurched towards authoritarianism” in its recent moves towards political stability. “After years of frequent changes of government and states of emergency, Nauru politics is characterised by an authoritarian approach to parliamentary oppositions, public demonstrations and freedom of speech”, said the report, which was published on Monday. This year the Nauruan government also introduced laws that criminalise disrespect of the national flag, anthem or emblem. Under the laws, a person could face up to five years in jail for not stopping their car when driving through a public area when the national anthem is playing. The Lowy Institute called for the Australian government to “do more to indicate its disapproval” of Nauru crackdown on opposition, media and the judiciary. “As host of the Australian detention centre, the Nauru government has entrenched executive power in the knowledge that criticism from Canberra will be low-key at most,” the report said.

78,"Macedonia is facing a political crisis following an unexpectedly low turnout by voters in a historic referendum to rename the Balkan state. Citizens were asked whether they endorsed a landmark deal struck with Greece, rechristening the state North Macedonia as a stepping stone to European Union and Nato membership. But minutes before polling stations closed it appeared that calls to boycott the vote had had an effect, with only or people, casting a ballot. Prime minister Zoran Zaev said he would recognise the democratic decision of those who had voted emphasising that the plebiscite was critical for the country western orientation, despite failing to secure the turnout required to make the vote valid. “No better agreement with Greece has been made or could be made and there is no other alternative than our country joining the EU. The referendum is decided by those who wanted to decide,” he told a raucous news conference. The social democrat leader, who now has to confront the task of pushing the controversial accord through parliament, rejected the notion that the referendum had been unsuccessful because the outcome fell short of the threshold. With of the vote counted, an overwhelming voted in favour of the deal. “I am determined to take Macedonia into the EU and Nato,” he said. “It is time to support European Macedonia .” The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, had been in touch and saluted the result, Zaev revealed, although it was later described by officials in Athens as “contradictory”. A spokeswoman for the US state department welcomed the outcome and said it could bring Macedonia economically and militarily closer to the west. Zaev has staked his political future on placing the country in the western sphere. “Now the will of the people … must be transposed into political activity in the parliament,” he told reporters, insisting that if the deal wasn’t ratified by MPs he would resort to “that other democratic tool” and call early parliamentary elections. Protesters gathered in front of Skopje communist-era parliament, where a podium had been erected draped in a banner declaring “the people boycotted a genocide. Never North, always Macedonia.” “This is a bad day for Zaev and a wonderful day for Macedonians,” said Martin Dukovski, standing outside the building holding a large red and yellow Macedonian flag. “I am a proud Macedonian. The government has to take back this deal. It has to say ‘no’ to Greece .” No poll has been as historic – or imbued with such sentiment – since the nation declared independence in The referendum was held against a backdrop of polarisation, potentially explosive emotion and Russia reportedly stepping up clandestine efforts to dash Macedonia embrace by the west. Working in unison with hardcore nationalists bent on boycotting the vote, Moscow has openly voiced distaste for the deal with Greece. Until the accord announcement in June, Athens had vowed to block its neighbour accession to both the EU and Nato protesting that – without a geographical qualifier – the name amounted to appropriation of its own cultural heritage and territorial ambitions. Eager to end the row, the result was met with disappointment by officials in Athens. Within the borders of landlocked Macedonia few issues have been as divisive. Many argue that with their country name also conveying a profound sense of identity, being asked to change it is tantamount to existential annihilation. “My first name is Makedonska,” said a raven-haired hotel employee as she made her way to a polling station in a local school in central Skopje. “What are they [the Greeks] going to to do? Ask me to change that?” Addressing the UN last week, the republic president, Gjorge Ivanov, described the referendum and the dilemma it posed as “historical suicide”. The former university professor had openly asked his fellow citizens to boycott the vote. Although Zaev government had described the plebiscite as “consultative”, it had been accepted that a low turnout would make it almost impossible to push the name-change deal through the parliament where support from at least MPs is required if constitutional changes are to be ratified. The nationalist main opposition VMRO-DPMNE party, which has denounced the deal – and is vehemently opposed to rewording the republic constitution – will now find it that much easier to resist ratification. “The fact is that the name agreement did not get a green light, but a stop sign from the people,” said the party leader, Hristijan Mickoski. Earlier he had appealed to Macedonians to “listen to their hearts” when they woke up on Sunday. The prospect of securing a majority turnout had been hampered by an electoral list dramatically trimmed by young people emigrating in search of work. Of the million on the list, an estimated are believed to have moved abroad. Hopes had been pinned on a “yes” vote being clinched with the help of Macedonia large ethnic Albanian community which, at around is its biggest minority. “We don’t have the emotional baggage of Slav Macedonians over the name issue,” said Petrit Sanagini, an ethnic Albanian, as he went to cast his ballot with his wife and baby daughter. “This is a compromise we feel we have to make to move our country forward towards a future of prosperity and security. It a historic day, a very special day. Our hope is that everyone will vote.” More than foreign observers monitored the plebiscite. In addition to EU and western officials the referendum had been watched closely in neighbouring Kosovo, where fierce opposition to the prospect of territorial adjustments with Serbia spurred thousands to take to the streets on Saturday. To the consternation of the multi-ethnic territory Albanian majority, Moscow has backed the idea of land swaps. “We very much want Macedonians to accept this deal and join Nato,” said Albin Kurti, the opposition politician whose self-determination movement, Vetëvendosje, organised the protests. “It will deter Russian ambitions and interference in the region,” he told the Guardian in his Pristina office. “And that could not come at a better time.”",1002,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/macedonia-to-vote-on-name-change-and-ending-greek-dispute
79,"North. It just a single five-letter word, but in Macedonia in recent weeks it has prompted many column inches of debate, hours of coffee-shop discussions and pages of online abuse. A referendum at the end of the month will ask citizens whether they are willing to add the word to the country official name, making it the Republic of North Macedonia. The change is the main part of an agreement between Macedonia and Greece signed by their respective prime ministers in June. Greece has long blocked Macedonian accession to Nato and the European Union, claiming its northern neighbour name is an unfair appropriation from the northern Greek region of Macedonia. For many inside Macedonia, changing the name is a delicate issue. “It not just about one word. Think about Northern Ireland and Ireland. Words have meaning,” said Sasho Klekovski, a pollster and analyst who opposes the deal. Nikola Dimitrov, Macedonia foreign minister, who spent months in negotiations with his Greek counterpart hammering out details of the deal, said it would offer a new path forward for the small nation of around million people, which has struggled since it became independent after the collapse of Yugoslavia. “We have lost a generation. I am I was when Macedonia became independent. In a way this is the second chance for our generation to make it,” he said in an interview at his office in central Skopje, Macedonia capital. On September the population will be asked: “Are you in favour of Nato and EU membership, and accepting the name agreement between the republic of Macedonia and Greece ?” Government critics say the wording is manipulative, but the defence minister, Radmila Šekerinska, said it was quite proper to phrase the question in two parts. “If there was a chance to get into the EU and Nato without the agreement with Greece, everyone would be thrilled,” she said. “To deny the connection between the EU and Nato and the agreement is to be irrational.” Few Macedonians are positive about the name change, but many speak of it with the grudging acceptance that might be accorded an unpleasant but necessary medical procedure. “We are an isolated, small and poor country, so let do it. It not fair, but it not about what is fair but about what is good for everyone. If there a chance for people to live better, let take it,” said Sanja Arsovska, an actor at the Skopje drama theatre. The deal has been stridently opposed by nationalists on both sides of the border – on Saturday Greeks protesters clashed with riot police – but polls suggest a slim majority are in favour of the deal, boosted by overwhelming support among Macedonia sizeable ethnic Albanian minority. The longstanding dispute between Skopje and Athens has been complicated in recent years by a “antiquisation” project carried out by the nationalist government of the previous prime minister Nikola Gruevski, in which dozens of statues, fountains and grand buildings adorned with faux-marble columns were erected in Skopje. The centrepiece is a fountain complex in the main square, topped with a statue of Alexander the Great on horseback. The monuments incensed Greece, who accused Skopje of appropriating Hellenic cultural and historical heritage. Gruevski was ousted from office in after a wire-tapping scandal and is now on trial for an array of offences. The new government reached the deal with Greece but will need the support of parts of Gruevski VMRO-DPMNE party to see it through, as the referendum is only consultative. Western diplomats are suggesting that a yes vote, even with a turnout below the threshold required for it to stand, would be a mandate for change. The ruling coalition would need to persuade around MPs from VMRO to vote with them in order to attain the two-thirds majority required for constitutional change. VMRO officials are furious that Macedonia will have to change its name not only in international communications but internally as well, with passports, ministry names and all other references to Macedonia to be replaced by North Macedonia. “They would have had a better agreement if they had let the Greeks write it themselves, because probably the Greeks would have been a bit embarrassed to give themselves absolutely everything,” said Aleksandar Nikoloski, the deputy head of VMRO, in an interview at the party headquarters, an imposing building filled with lurid artworks that reflect Gruevski grandiose visions. VMRO are under intense international pressure not to scupper the agreement and have yet to announce whether or not they will call for a boycott of the referendum. Nikoloski has denied government claims that the party offered to support the deal in exchange for an amnesty for Gruevski and others. As well as trying to get the opposition onside, Macedonian officials are keeping an eye on Moscow during the campaign. Russia has openly said it opposes Macedonia Nato accession and has been accused of working behind the scenes to try to scupper the deal. Greece recently expelled Russian diplomats, accusing them of offering bribes to opponents of the deal. In Macedonia, the main pro-Russia force is Janko Bachev, a fringe politician whose United Macedonia party has sprung up in recent months. Bachev, speaking from the party offices where a Russian flag flies from the balcony, claimed the polls showing a majority of Macedonians in favour of Nato membership were “funded by the CIA” and insisted most Macedonians opposed the deal. Macedonia and Greece fail to resolve bitter naming dispute “All the main parties here support liberal values such as homosexuality, gay marriage, changing Macedonia name and erasing everything that is Macedonian,” he said, adding that the Kremlin instead supported “traditional values” that aligned with the views of most Macedonians. He denied receiving funding from Russia but said he wanted Macedonia to enter into a strategic alliance with the Kremlin. Bachev, who is calling for a boycott of the vote, is not seen as a serious political force by most observers, but western diplomats are nevertheless following Moscow moves warily. “For years, Russia never said anything about Macedonia; suddenly they are coming out with all kinds of statements,” said one. “I don’t think they are going to launch a Montenegro-style coup here, but could they put a few guys into a crowd and create a disturbance? I wouldn’t rule that out.” Western countries are pushing strongly for the deal to be a success, with Germany Angela Merkel visiting Skopje this weekend. If the deal is pushed through, Skopje and Athens have agreed to disagree on who or what constitutes a Macedonian: a sub-clause of the agreement says “the parties acknowledge that their respective understanding of the terms ‘Macedonia’ and ‘Macedonian’ refers to a different historical context and cultural heritage”. When it comes to the Skopje monuments of Alexander the Great and other classical heroes, the government has agreed that within six months it will take “corrective action” by renaming monuments that “refer in any way to ancient Hellenic history and civilisation”. Dimitrov said: “In the past we sacrificed our reality for mythology. Now we are sacrificing mythology for reality, and reality is what really matters.”",1183,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/10/its-not-about-what-is-fair-macedonians-prepare-to-vote-on-name-change
80,"The European Union needs to be more visible in the western Balkans to counter Russian attempts to destabilise the region, a leading MEP has said, as EU leaders gather for a summit in Brussels on Thursday. “Geopolitics has returned to the Balkans,” said David McAllister, a German MEP and chair of the European parliament foreign affairs committee. “We are seeing the growing Russian influence, we are seeing growing Turkish influence, the United States is a player, the European Union is a player, so there are different interests at stake,” he said. But it was Russia role that he described as negative, citing the Kremlin suspected involvement in a failed coup in Montenegro and Moscow support for hardline nationalist leaders in the region. Rumbling Balkans threaten foreign policy headache for Trump Russia was also exerting influence on political debate by organising anti-western, and anti-EU propaganda, McAllister said, especially in Serbian-language media outlets that promoted the Kremlin world view, as well as “conspiracy theories and Serbian ultranationalism”. EU leaders will discuss the growing tension in the Balkans at the Brussels summit. According to a draft memo seen by the Guardian, the leaders will renew their promise that the door of membership remains open while stressing the importance of reforms and “good neighbourly relations”. Member states are divided over whether the summit communique should identify the “outside forces” carving out a bigger role in the region. Russia is a particular concern, but officials are also wary of Turkey growing role. “There is third country interference,” one EU diplomat said. EU diplomats are also worried about Balkan citizens heading to Iraq and Syria to fight for Islamic extremist groups. A disproportionately high number of Kosovans, Albanians and Bosnians have been fighting in Middle Eastern war zones, according to the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network. Balkan countries were given the green light to begin the long road to EU membership in but progress has been mixed. Croatia joined the EU in , and Montenegro and Serbia have embarked on formal membership talks. Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia are further behind in the process. The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, visited the region last week, in an attempt to revive momentum towards EU integration. Speaking after her visit, she laid out her “profound concerns” but also optimism that all countries could eventually join the EU. “The Balkans can easily become one of the chessboards where the big power game can be played,” Mogherini said. Her trip was also aimed at reassuring the region it had not been forgotten. While the EU has been rocked by one existential crisis after another, from Brexit to Greek debt to coping with migrants and refugees, nationalist and inter-ethnic tensions have been bubbling away in the western Balkans. In January, a Serbian train bearing signs reading “Kosovo is Serbian” was sent towards Kosovo, plunging relations between the countries into a crisis . Meanwhile, Macedonia is entrenched in an increasingly bitter political crisis that has pitted neighbours against each other, and Montenegro was shaken by the assassination attempt against its pro-western prime minister last October. The failed coup has been linked to Russian authorities, although Moscow has denied any involvement. Tensions have also flared in Bosnia, where the Bosnian-Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, is accused of flouting the peace agreement that ended a four-year civil war. The Guardian view on the EU and migration: let stop the Balkans being part of the problem | Editorial McAllister disputed the view, held by some regional leaders, that the Balkans have been forgotten by Brussels but said it was time for the EU to increase its visibility. A recent poll showed Serbians were more likely to assume Russia was the country biggest aid donor, rather than the EU, although the estimated received from Brussels since far exceeds sums from Moscow. Citing this poll , McAllister said the EU needed to increase its efforts “to make the European Union and its good work more visible in all the six western Balkan countries”. The MEP was elected to lead the foreign affairs committee in January. In early April, MEPs are to vote on a resolution drafted by McAllister calling on Serbia to align its foreign policy to Europe .

81,"Four Russian diplomats will be banned from Greece after evidence revealed Russia was trying to foment opposition to a historic deal between Greece and Macedonia that is likely to pave the way for Macedonia Nato membership and so weaken Russian influence in the western Balkans. Greece said it would expel two Russian diplomats and ban two others. Zoran Zaev, the Macedonian prime minister, speaking at the Nato summit in Brussels, indicated he knew Russia was behind some of the protests outside his own parliament, but he said his country was not going to seek conflict. “We are a small country. We want to build a friendship with everybody. There is no alternative but Nato membership,” he said. He said countries, such as Bulgaria, managed to triple foreign direct investment after joining Nato , and he hoped it would deliver the same boost to his country. Russia, involved in a wider struggle for influence with the EU across the region, has already been accused of backing a failed coup in Montenegro in Russia said it would respond to the Greek expulsions by taking similar steps against Greek diplomats in Moscow. Macedonia agrees to new name after dispute with Greece The expulsion of the diplomats, revealed in the Greek media on Wednesday but relayed by the Greek government to Russia on July, follows evidence they were encouraging rallies to oppose the Macedonian name deal, including offering bribes to opponents of the deal. The historic naming deal, agreed on June, will see the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia bow to Greek objections and change its name to Northern Macedonia. Greece had claimed the title Macedonia implied a territorial claim on the Greek province of the same name. The Greek newspaper Kathimerini named the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society, an organisation which promotes Russian ties to Christians in the Middle East, as being among the groups trying to fan Russian influence in Greece, including in the Greek Orthodox monastic community of Mount Athos. A representative of the society denied it was involved in any alleged attempts to bribe senior Greek Orthodox clergymen, the Russian state Interfax news agency reported. In Nato agreed to invite Macedonia to join the military alliance once its name dispute was settled, and Wednesday Nato summit meeting in Brussels will conclude with a formal invitation to join Nato. The name has been disputed between the two countries ever since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. Balkan states 'must embrace reform before EU ascension' “We had issued warnings to Russian authorities for some time over [the actions of] these specific four diplomats and civilians, and on Friday it was officially raised, giving them a reasonable period of a few days to leave the country,” said a Greek government source. The deal faces opposition in both Greece and in Macedonia, where a heated referendum is planned this autumn. The Macedonian opposition is trying to block the establishment of an electoral commission required to prepare for the referendum. It is also accusing leading politicians in the Macedonian government of treason for agreeing to the deal. Rejection of the deal inside Greece is, amongst others, coming from the seven MPs inside Independent Greeks (ANEL), the small rightwing nationalistic party in a governing coalition with the left wing Syriza, headed by Greece prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. The name issue has led to splits inside ANEL, and Russian media has been promoting the idea of a new populist party led by Dimitris Kammenos, dedicated to blocking the name change.

82,"Russia has hit out at allegations that it was involved in an attempted coup during Montenegro election last year, ridiculing them as “absurd” and unsubstantiated. On Sunday, a Montenegrin prosecutor said “Russian state bodies” had played a role in an attempted putsch with the aim of stopping the Balkan country from joining Nato. Montenegrin police arrested a group of Serbian nationals on the eve of the October vote and two Russian suspects are wanted over the alleged plot to seize parliament and assassinate former president and prime minister Milo Đukanović. Montenegrin authorities had previously said the conspiracy was orchestrated by “Russian nationalists” but special prosecutor Milivoje Katnić went a step further on Sunday evening, suggesting that Russian authorities were involved. “So far we have had evidence that Russian nationalist structures were behind [the plot], but now also that Russian state bodies were involved at a certain level,” Katnić told local media. “The organs of the Russian state must investigate which bodies are involved and open a criminal trial over these acts.” A spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir, Putin, dismissed the allegations. “These (are) absurd accusations … We do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, including Montenegro ,” Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Serbia deports Russians suspected of plotting Montenegro coup According to Katnić, a key witness, Aleksandar Sinđelić, a nationalist Serb, was invited to Moscow by Eduard Sismakov, a member of “Russian military structures”, to be cleared for the mission. Sismakov, using the alias Shirakov, “asked him to work first to prevent Montenegro from entering Nato. That is the sole motivation of these structures,” Katnić said. Montenegrin prosecutors suspect people, mostly Serbs, of links to the alleged coup, and are searching for two Russians, including Sismakov, who is believed to be the main organiser. The organs of the Russian state must investigate which bodies are involved and open a criminal trial Special prosecutor Milivoje Katnić Three Serbian nationals were jailed for five months each last week after admitting to “creating a criminal organisation” to launch the coup. The suspects include two leading pro-Russian lawmakers from the opposition Democratic Front (DF), Andrija Mandić and Milan Knežević, whose parliamentary immunity was lifted last week so that they could face charges and be arrested. In a surprise decision immediately after the parliamentary vote, Montenegro top prosecutor issued a binding order that they remain at liberty. The DF is strongly opposing Montenegro bid to join Nato but denies any involvement in a coup plot, claiming the affair was fabricated by the government.

83,"Macedonia prime minister, Zoran Zaev, has upped the ante in the battle over his country name, telling opposition MPs they either back him or he will call early elections. “The process will not be frozen, we have to move forward,” the social democrat leader said on Monday. “We will know in a few days whether we can reach an agreement with the opposition to adopt the constitutional changes. The alternative is elections.” In a referendum on Sunday, voters overwhelmingly backed an agreement to change the country name to North Macedonia , but turnout was unexpectedly low after opponents of the deal were urged to stay away. Result of Macedonia referendum is another victory for Russia | Simon Tisdall With all results in on Monday, the state electoral commission announced that voter participation stood at far short of the needed to make the result valid, although of ballots cast were in favour of the accord. Emboldened by the results, Zaev issued the ultimatum as he attempted to muster support for the deal with Greece that has EU and Nato membership as its ultimate reward. The nationalist opposition, with financial backing reputedly from Russia, had campaigned heavily for the plebiscite to be boycotted, arguing that the deal appeased Athens. Since seceding from Yugoslavia in Greece has argued that its neighbour name usurps its history and includes thinly veiled territorial claims over its own province of Macedonia. Marko Trosanovski, of the Institute for Democracy thinktank, said: “No one expected such a low turnout. The success of the boycott was a surprise. While there might not have been tangible evidence of Russian intervention, the result goes along with Russian interests in the region.” Moscow has long opposed Macedonia embrace by the west, with its prospective membership of Nato military alliance viewed as hostile encroachment of its own territory in Europe former communist east. Visiting Skopje before the referendum, the US defence secretary, James Mattis, accused Russia of engaging in “a malicious cyber activity” to wreck the ballot. Despite denials, much of the disinformation campaign is believed to have been run from behind the iron-fenced windows and walls of the two-storey Russian embassy in the heart of Skopje. In a terse statement on Monday, the Kremlin said it was carefully watching events in Macedonia. “We are observing closely and of course think that all processes should remain within the framework of the law,” said its spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. Opponents of the agreement say the mass abstention has robbed the Zaev government of the grounds to rewrite the constitution to reflect the new name. By law the two-party coalition needs a two-thirds majority in the parliament to ratify the agreement. The US state department, echoing similar statements from Nato and the EU after the referendum, urged MPs to “rise above partisan politics”. Branko Gerovski, a prominent political commentator, said: “The big issue now is how Zaev will get to that magic number, There are some MPs in the opposition who might be motivated to back the deal. In the Balkans, crossing palms with silver has always helped stability, and here in Macedonia we know all about instability. It is vital that we join Nato for the security of this country.” Polls have repeatedly shown high levels of support among Macedonians for accession to both the EU and Nato. “It is the one issue which has the highest consensus in the country,” said Trosanovski. Backing for membership of the military alliance is especially strong among Albanians in Macedonia, as well as in Kosovo and Albania. “We are surprised, worried and disappointed that the low turnout even extended to [ethnic] Albanians in Macedonia,” said Berat Buzhala, editor-in-chief of Kosovo leading newspaper, Gazeta Express. “It is critical that as our immediate neighbour Macedonia joins Nato. If it fails it will only help Putin make trouble in Europe backyard.” Macedonia main opposition party, VMRO, insisted the result was a clear rejection of the deal with Greece. “The people have clearly sent a message to Zaev that he has no legitimacy to push this deal,” it said. “Instead of manipulating, he should face the reality and reject this agreement, which is at the expense of the Republic of Macedonia.” But insiders said at least three or four VRMO MPs with a business background were likely to back the deal. “Despite their personal grievances over the name issue, there are some who understand that if left out of the process the party will be completely marginalised,” said Gerovski. “People in business want to see the country in the EU because they know that way lies prosperity.” With ethnic Albanians already in his coalition, Zaev is expected to also try to persuade MPs who represent the multi-ethnic republic Turkish, Roma, Serbian and Bosniak minorities to support the deal. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who is up against his own cohort of nationalist opponents, including the party headed by his defence minister, Panos Kammenos, faces a general election next year. “On both sides there is a sense now of time being the enemy,” said Gerovski. “If it goes down to the wire and elections are called, for sure the political crisis will deepen.”",860,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/01/macedonian-pm-issues-ultimatum-in-name-change-battle
84,"he road link between Greece and Macedonia has never looked better. Newly tunnelled, cemented, widened and signposted, it winds through rolling hills, past vineyards and villages and wood-covered slopes all the way to Skopje, the former Yugoslav republic capital. The European Union takes great pride in this. At a time of impoverished connections between the two bickering Balkan neighbours, the newly paved route is concrete proof of what progress and prosperity can achieve. Every few miles a billboard proclaims it is the EU that co-funded the road “rehabilitation”. When Macedonians vote on Sunday in a referendum that could result in changing their country name – and resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece – Brussels hopes it is projects like this that will sway their ballots. A yes vote would not only see the tiny state being renamed North Macedonia but would clear the path to membership of Nato and the EU. As the military alliance member, the landlocked republic, which came close to inter-ethnic conflict in would secure the stability and security it has long craved in a region prone to shifting borders and bloody strife. For Petre Shilegov, the mayor of Skopje, the choice is a no-brainer. “It very simple. Either we become North Macedonia or North Korea,” he says with strident emphasis in his airy single-storey office. “Our opponents have no plan B. They can only offer isolation.” With Macedonians facing record unemployment, economic stagnation and few prospects, the referendum offers a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to move forward. “The EU spends approximately per day supporting Macedonia,” Shilegov explained. “If we have a yes, that sum will increase and everything in our country will get better – in our schools, in our hospitals, on our streets.” The high-stakes vote follows a landmark accord struck with Greece in June , almost years after the republic seceded from Yugoslavia and declared independence. Under the deal, signed on the banks of Lake Prespa by Skopje social democrat prime minister, Zoran Zaev, and Athens’ leftist leader, Alexis Tsipras, Greece pledged to lift objections that have thwarted the nation EU and Nato integration on condition that the state agreed to amend its name by adding a geographical qualifier and dropped any claim to cherished Greek cultural figures including Alexander the Great. Athens has argued with vigour that unless distinguished from the adjacent Greek province of Macedonia, the republic nomenclature would forever imply thinly disguised territorial ambitions towards a region that includes the strategic warm-water port of Thessaloniki. Greeks, in return, have had to accept their neighbours as internationally recognised Macedonians who speak the Macedonian language even if, as Slavs, they bear no relation to the ancient Macedonian warrior king. On Sunday, Macedonians will be asked if they endorse the agreement once and for all. “We are very lucky to have had Zaev and Tsipras on both sides,” enthused Sasho Ordanovski, Skopje preeminent political commentator. “Macedonia has been a rare success story of peaceful coexistence in the Balkans,” he said of the ability of the country Slavic Orthodox majority and Muslim Albanian minority to live together harmoniously. “But membership of the EU and Nato will enable us to finally secure the liberal consensus to guarantee this model of multi-ethnic, cultural, multi-religious democracy.” At the heart of the Balkan peninsular, Macedonia has long been viewed as a potential powder keg with the strength to ignite a major regional conflagration, which is why the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the US defence secretary, James Mattis, have all descended on Skopje in recent weeks to back the name deal and cheer Macedonians on. “Suddenly it is as if our country is at the centre of the world,” Shilegov smiled, listing the high-profile visitors one by one. “This vote is too important to fail.” Government officials and western diplomats animatedly predict that the plebiscite will pass. But, as in Greece, the compromise it entails has elicited ferocious nationalist opposition. Until campaigning officially ended at midnight on Thursday, protesters such as Goran, in a baseball cap and floppy jacket, were handing out leaflets in Skopje central square exhorting pedestrians to boycott the referendum. In an atmosphere described as both febrile and calm, anti-agreement propaganda has proliferated. By the eve of the vote the republic myriad “fake news” farms – infamous for the role they played in disseminating disinformation before the US elections – had reportedly gone into overdrive, with opponents making widespread use of social media in an effort to suppress voter participation. Decrying the deal, President Gjorge Ivanov has urged Macedonians to boycott the referendum. Some million citizens are eligible to cast ballots but a massive exodus of young people in search of work means confusion abounds as to how many are still in the country. “At least of the voter list are not physically present but they still contribute to the threshold of said Marko Trostanovski, who heads the Institute for Democracy thinktank in Skopje. “In reality we have to hit a threshold of and achieving that is mission impossible.” A low turnout could unleash a scenario where the Zaev government is unable to persuade Skopje parliament to endorse the constitutional changes to push the name deal through. Shilegov, a senior figure in the ruling social democrat party, is leaving nothing to chance. In recent weeks he has been going door-to-door to convince citizens of the need to cast ballots. “People have to have an opinion about this. They just can’t stay at home and go along with the boycott.” But there are worrying signs. In recent months Moscow has intensified its campaign to spoil the vote, with the fiercely pro-Russia United Macedonia party leading the boycott drive. With its augmented staff, Skopje Russian embassy has been described as a hothouse of intelligence activity. Visiting the capital, Mattis warned of the perils that lay ahead, accusing the Kremlin of employing underhand means and “malicious cyber activity” to scupper the vote. While Moscow has denied the charges, it has been open in its disgruntlement over Nato encroachment into the western Balkans, an area long regarded as a traditional sphere of influence. “Skopje right now is a bit like Casablanca before the war,” said Trostanovski. “It is a city full of spies and operatives all watching how the vote will go.”",1046,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/macedonian-vote-either-we-become-north-macedonia-or-north-korea
85,"Mounting tensions between Athens and Moscow have exacerbated growing friction on Nato south-eastern flank, with the two traditional allies locked in an increasingly hostile war of words. As evidence accumulates of the extraordinary lengths the Kremlin is willing to go to in order to thwart Nato expansion in the Balkans, the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, used two interviews at the weekend to publicly rebuke Russia . “Russia must realise that it cannot disrespect the national interests of another state because it feels it is stronger,” Kotzias told the Syntakton newspaper. Asked whether he was concerned about the abrupt souring in relations between the two countries following Athens announcement in July that it would expel two Russian diplomats for attempting to undermine the landmark accord settling the name row between Greece and Macedonia, Kotzias insisted on Sunday that national interests came first. “Greece has decided to send a message to the east and the west, towards all its friends and others, that regardless of who is violating the principles of national sovereignty and respect toward us, measures will be taken,” he told the state-run Athens news agency. “The time when turning a blind eye was considered diplomacy has passed.” The rebuke came days after prime minister Alexis Tsipras leftist-led coalition announced it would expel the Russian envoys – and bar two others from re-entering the country – for activities it said violated Greek law. Early last week, Athens declared that it considered the matter closed. Greek fury had focused on Russian efforts to sabotage the historic agreement signed between Athens and Skopje on the banks of Lake Prespa in June. Within days of the deal being reached, the former Yugoslav republic was invited to join Nato , an offer zealously accepted by the prime minister, Zoran Zaev, on the grounds that membership would bring security and economic growth to the tiny, multi-ethnic state. But Russia, which has long regarded the region as falling into its own orbit of influence, was angered. “Moscow is determined to stop the further expansion of Nato in south-east Europe,” said James Ker-Lindsay, a Balkan specialist and visiting fellow at the London School of Economics. “However, most observers thought it would concentrate its efforts on Macedonia , rather than Greece.” On both sides of the border, reports have mounted up of the increasingly audacious methods Moscow is prepared to use to prevent Balkan nations being embraced by the west. The west must not just abandon the Balkans to Russia embrace | Ivor Roberts Last week, Zaev accused Greek-Russian businessmen of funding resistance to the accord by whipping up nationalist and anti-Nato fury among hardliners staging violent demonstrations. Macedonian officials, he said, had discovered local pro-Russian businessmen being paid up to to foment acts of violence in the runup to a referendum his social democrat government is expected to hold on the name deal in the autumn. The allegations followed an explosive report by the investigative journalism body the Organised Crime and Corruption project that detailed the “strong subversive propaganda and intelligence activity” Macedonia has been subjected to by a Kremlin that also sees the strategic state as crucial to its European gas pipelines. And in Greece , Russian agents bent on penetrating the country intelligence and armed forces have also been accused of bribery. In an indication of the escalating tensions, Moscow announced that it would be suspending a planned visit to the Greek capital by Russia foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in September. Although Moscow has yet to retaliate, Athens has been warned that countermeasures will be taken, with the Russian foreign ministry accusing Greece of participating in “dirty provocations” orchestrated by third parties. In contrast to other EU member states, Greece refused to withdraw any of its diplomatic personnel from Moscow in protest over the poisoning in the UK of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. Athens has long argued for a softening of EU sanctions against Moscow. But Russia thinly veiled suggestion that Washington is behind the expulsions has also been robustly rejected. “Our foreign policy is multi-dimensional and our relations with Russia are very established and not going to go away,” said Costas Douzinas, an MP-cum-London University law professor who heads the Greek parliament defence and foreign affairs committee. “But we don’t want anyone interfering in our democratic and political processes. We won’t be played around, or pushed around.” Ker-Lindsay said: “It seems Russia did not recognise just how important this agreement was to the Greek government.” “By taking such a public step,” he added, referring to the expulsions, “Athens was sending a very clear message about how angry it was that Moscow was trying to undermine the single most important foreign policy victory of its term in office. It was also a very personal victory for Kotzias, who has long sought to improve Greece relations with its neighbours.”",809,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/23/greece-warns-russia-of-further-measures-after-diplomatic-explusion
86,"As someone who recently participated in a two-year EU-funded criminal justice project in North Macedonia, I would endorse the sentiments expressed by the signatories of the letter saying that the historic deal on shared Macedonian identity must be honoured July), and praise the courage of both Greeks and Macedonians in seeking a resolution to their protracted dispute. This could never have happened under the previous corrupt regime of Gruevski and his VROM party. Share your best photographs of the week with us The new government of North Macedonia must not forget the importance of the Ohrid framework agreement (implemented in to help stabilise the country after the ethnic riots of the previous years). Albanian Muslims make up nearly of the total population, and the framework stated that the multi-ethnic character of Macedonia population had to be reflected in its public life. The agreement was the stimulus for the founding of an Albanian-speaking university (South-Eastern European University, based in Tetovo and with a campus in Skopje), funded by US aid and other donors. It will be important, as the Greek-North Macedonia negotiations take place over the coming months, that both parties acknowledge and accept the terms of the framework, and that the Albanian Muslim population continues to be accorded the respect and the educational and other social opportunities enshrined in the framework. Andy Stelman Bishops Castle, Shropshire I would like to make few important points: Greece never had a territory called Macedonia prior to In Macedonia was politically divided under the Bucharest treaty, hence Greece obtaining Aegean Macedonia, over of the original territory. After the occupation in Greece named this part of Macedonia as Northern Greece and appointed a minister of Northern Greece. Most world media fail to report that there is also a part of Bulgaria called Pirin Macedonia. It is unjust not only to the Macedonian community but to those around the world who want to know the truth not to be properly informed about these facts about Macedonia and the problems it currently faces.

87,"fter almost three decades, one of the most intractable Balkan disputes has ended on the banks of a lake as Greece and Macedonia signed an accord formally heralding a new era of peace. On a historic day for a region long soaked in the politics of animosity, the prime ministers of the neighbouring states declared that the bitter dispute over Macedonia name was finally over – despite scattered protests on both sides of the frontier. Once ratified, the pact will see the small Balkan nation being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia. “This is our own rendezvous with history,” the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, told officials gathered under a giant marquee pitched at the edge of Lake Prespa, where the borders of Greece , Macedonia and Albania meet. “We are here to heal the wounds of time,” he insisted, adding that for too long the Balkans had suffered from “the poison of chauvinism and the divisions of nationalist hatred”. Macedonia and Greece fail to resolve bitter naming dispute The Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev arrived at the ceremony by speedboat. He called on critics of the agreement, which was announced five days ago, “to step out of the past and look to the future”. “Our peoples want peace … We will be partners and allies,” said Zaev, who must have the pact passed by parliament and endorsed by a referendum before it is accepted by Greece. “We are proud of today agreement … May we stay as forever united as we are on this day.” There was rapturous applause as the countries’ respective foreign ministers signed the accord. To get to this point has not been easy – and challenges posed by nationalist hardliners could yet scupper the deal. But the significance of a day, as heavy in symbolism as historic import, was lost on neither. From the moment its neighbour proclaimed independence as the Republic of Macedonia following the collapse of Yugoslavia in Greece has believed its chosen name and symbols conveyed ill-disguised territorial claims against its own province of Macedonia. Maps depicting the landlocked state borders extending to the strategic port city of Thessaloniki, Greek Macedonia capital, have helped stoke fears. So, too, has the appropriation of ancient Greek figures. The erection of a gargantuan statue of the warrior king Alexander the Great in Skopje central square fuelled further claims of cultural theft. In as the confrontational rhetoric deepened, Athens imposed a trade embargo against its neighbour, saying the Slavic state policies posed “a real and present danger to Greece”. But on Sunday all of that appeared to have been relegated to the past. Taking the podium after adding his own signature to the accord, Matthew Nimetz, the UN special envoy who has mediated negotiations since the early spoke of the “political courage” required to arrive at this point. The EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and EU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn, who were present for the signing, spoke glowingly of the signing as a rare moment of success for Europe . The pact opens the way to Macedonia joining Nato and beginning EU accession talks. Previous such moves have been blocked by Athens and triggered growing western security concerns in a region that has become increasingly susceptible to Russian influence . By agreeing to rename itself the Republic of North Macedonia the country will replace an interim accord under which it joined the UN years ago as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The agreement means Skopje will need to make more than changes to its constitution before Greece brings the pact before its own parliament for ratification – a task replete with challenges for Zaev, who like Tsipras has taken a progressive view on the issue, and faces considerable opposition from nationalists. Macedonia president, Gjorge Ivanov, has refused to support the deal, presaging a stormy few months ahead. Changing hearts and minds on an issue that is as much about identity – ethnic, cultural and linguistic – as it is about pride, will be paramount in the runup to a referendum that Zaev has called for the autumn at the latest. But the social democrat, who has been likened to John F Kennedy, is also described as a natural peacemaker by supporters desperate to see their impoverished country join the rest of the world. Ivanov can veto the accord but ultimately will have to accept it if parliament endorses the pact a second time round. Tsipras, who survived a vote of no-confidence on Saturday brought against his leftwing government by the conservative opposition over the deal, faces similar challenges. Mustering enough votes in parliament to ratify the pact without the support of the nationalist Anel party, his junior partner, won’t be easy. A poll released at the weekend showed of Greeks rejecting the agreement. But while the path ahead is strewn with potholes, both sides have said there is no going back. Affiliate parties in Europe have already begun jockeying to convince politicians in Athens and Skopje that the row has to end. The Lake Prespa accord erases the last trace of the old Yugoslavia. With the adoption of its new name, Macedonia will not only assume a new title, it will ultimately change the map of Europe. This article was amended on June to correct the spellings of the Anel party and Gjorge Ivanov.",890,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/macedonia-greece-dispute-name-accord-prespa

Disruption to supplies coming through the embattled Red Sea port of Hodeida could “cause starvation on an unprecedented scale”, the British-based NGO said in a new report. Save the Children said an extra one million children now risk falling into famine as prices of food and transportation rise, bringing the total to million. Yemen: 'dramatic deterioration' after talks collapse and port city bombarded Any type of closure at the port “would put the lives of hundreds of thousands of children in immediate danger while pushing millions more into famine”, it added. Impoverished Yemen has been mired in deadly conflict between Shia Houthi rebels and troops loyal to President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi since A Saudi-led alliance intervened in in a bid to bolster the president, accusing Iran of backing the Houthis, but nearly people have since been killed. Deadly clashes resumed around the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida following the collapse of talks in Geneva this month.

89,"This is the victim impact statement submitted in writing by Andrea Constand, the former Temple University employee whom Bill Cosby was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting in and released by prosecutors at Cosby sentencing Tuesday in Norristown, Pennsylvania: To truly understand the impact that sexual assault has had on my life, you have to understand the person that I was before it happened. At the time of the assault, I was years old, and a fit, confident athlete. I was strong and skilled, with great reflexes, agility and speed. When I graduated from high school in Toronto, I was one of the top three female high school basketball players in Canada. Dozens of American colleges lined up to offer me basketball scholarships, and I chose the University of Arizona. For four years, I was a shooting guard on the women basketball team, scoring up to points a game. It was an amazing time in my life, and I learned a lot, developed a circle of really good friends, many of them teammates, and travelled around the US to compete. The only downside was that I missed my family and developed severe homesickness. When it started to affect my studies and my training, my Dad came up with the idea to move his own father and mother to Tucson. My grandparents were in their late when they gamely agreed to move more than miles to help me adjust to life away from home. They were retired after selling their Toronto restaurant business, and figured the warm, dry climate would suit them anyway. I had always enjoyed a special relationship with my grandparents. Not only had I grown up in their home, but I spoke Greek before I spoke English. They got an apartment close to mine, and I was there most days, talking and laughing over my favourite home-cooked meals. The homesickness quickly evaporated. After I graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in communications, I signed a two-year contract to play professional basketball for Italy. Going pro took my athletic training to a whole new level. Once again, I thrived in the team atmosphere, and enjoyed travelling Europe although we rarely saw more than the basketball venues and the hotel rooms where we slept. Bill Cosby sentenced to three to years in prison for sexual assault When my contract ended, my former coach from the University of Arizona encouraged me to apply for a job as director of operations for the women basketball team at Temple University in Philadelphia. It was a busy, challenging position that required me to manage a lot of logistical details so that others could focus on training the team for competition. I also made all the travel arrangements and went to tournaments with the team and support staff. It was a great job but after a few years, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the healing arts, my other passion. I also wanted to work closer to home, where I would be reunited with my large, extended family, and many friends. I knew who I was and I liked who I was. I was at the top of my game, certain that the groundwork provided by my education and athletic training would stand me in good stead whatever challenges lay ahead. How wrong I was. In fact, nothing could have prepared me for an evening of January when life as I knew it came to an abrupt halt. I had just given my two-month notice at Temple when the man I had come to know as a mentor and friend drugged and sexually assaulted me. Instead of being able to run, jump and pretty much do anything I wanted physically, during the assault I was paralyzed and completely helpless. I could not move my arms or legs. I couldn’t speak or even remain conscious. I was completely vulnerable, and powerless to protect myself. After the assault, I wasn’t sure what had actually happened but the pain spoke volumes. The shame was overwhelming. Self-doubt and confusion kept me from turning to my family or friends as I normally did. I felt completely alone, unable to trust anyone, including myself. I made it through the next few weeks by focusing on work. The women basketball team was in the middle of the Atlantic tournament and was travelling a lot. It was an extremely busy time for me, and the distraction helped take my mind off what had happened. When the team wasn’t on the road, however, I was in the basketball office at Temple, and was required to interact with Mr Cosby, who was on the board of trustees. The sound of his voice over the phone felt like a knife going through my guts. The sight of the man who drugged and sexually assaulted me coming into the basketball office filled me with dread. I did everything my job required of me but kept my head down, counting the days until I could return to Canada. I trusted that once I left, things would get back to normal. Instead, the pain and anguish came with me. At my parent house, where I was staying until I got settled, I couldn’t talk, eat, sleep or socialize. Instead of feeling less alone because I was back home with my family, I felt more isolated than ever. Instead of my legendary big appetite and “hollow leg” – a running joke in my family – I picked at my food, looking more like a scarecrow with each passing week. I was always a sound sleeper but now I couldn’t sleep for more than two or three hours. I felt exhausted all the time. I used the demands of my new courses to opt out of family gatherings and events, and to avoid going out with friends. As far as anyone could tell, I was pre-occupied with my studies. But the terrible truth about what had happened to me – at the hands of a man my family and friends admired and respected – was swirling around inside me. Then the nightmares started. I dreamed that another woman was being assaulted right in front of me and it was all my fault. In the dream, I was consumed with guilt, and pretty soon, that agonizing feeling spilled over into my waking hours too. I became more and more anxious that what had happened to me was going to happen to someone else. I grew terrified that it might already be too late, that the sexual assaults were continuing because I didn’t speak out. Then one morning I called my mother on the telephone to tell her what had happened to me. She had heard me cry out in my sleep. She wouldn’t let me put her off, and insisted that I tell her what was wrong. She wouldn’t settle for anything less than a complete and truthful explanation. Reporting the assault to the Durham regional police in Toronto only intensified the fear and pain, making me feel more vulnerable and ashamed than ever. When the Montgomery county district attorney outside Philadelphia decided not to prosecute for lack of evidence, we were left with no sense of validation or justice. After we launched civil claims, the response from Mr Cosby legal team was swift and furious. It was meant to frighten and intimidate and it worked. The psychological, emotional and financial bullying included a slander campaign in the media that left my entire family reeling in shock and disbelief. Instead of being praised as a straight-shooter, I was called a gold digger, a con artist, and a pathological liar. My hard-working middle class parents were accused of trying to get money from a rich and famous man. At the deposition during the civil trial, I had to relive every moment of the sexual assault in horrifying detail in front of Mr Cosby and his lawyers. I felt traumatized all over again and was often in tears. I had to watch Cosby make jokes and attempt to degrade and diminish me, while his lawyers belittled and sneered at me. It deepened my sense of shame and helplessness, and at the end of each day, I left emotionally drained and exhausted. Fallen stars: the dark history of Hollywood Walk of Fame When the case closed with a settlement, sealed testimony and a nondisclosure agreement, I thought that finally – finally – I could get on with my life, that this awful chapter in my life was over at last. These exact same feelings followed me throughout both criminal trials. The attacks on my character continued, spilling over outside the courtroom steps attempting to discredit me, and cast me in false light. These character assassinations have caused me to suffer insurmountable stress and anxiety, which I still experience today. I still didn’t know that my sexual assault was just the tip of the iceberg. Now, more than other women have self-identified as sexual assault victims of Bill Cosby. We may never know the full extent of his double life as a sexual predator but his decades-long reign of terror as a serial rapist is over. I have often asked myself why the burden of being the sole witness in two criminal trials had to fall to me. The pressure was enormous. I knew that how my testimony was perceived – that how I was perceived – would have an impact on every member of the jury and on the future mental and emotional well-being of every sexual assault victim who came before me. But I had to testify. It was the right thing to do, and I wanted to do the right thing, even if it was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. When the first trial ended in a mistrial, I didn’t hesitate to step up again. I know now that I am one of the lucky ones. But still, when the sexual assault happened, I was a young woman brimming with confidence and looking forward to a future bright with possibilities. Now, almost years later, I’m a middle-aged woman who been stuck in a holding pattern for most of her adult life, unable to heal fully or to move forward. Bill Cosby took my beautiful, healthy young spirit and crushed it. He robbed me of my health and vitality, my open nature, and my trust in myself and others. I’ve never married and I have no partner. I live alone. My dogs are my constant companions, and the members of my immediate family are my closest friends. My life revolves around my work as a therapeutic massage practitioner. Many of my clients need help reducing the effects of accumulated stress. But I’ve also trained in medical massage at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and often help cancer patients manage the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. I help many others too – people with Parkinson, arthritis, diabetes and so on. Some of my clients are in their I help them cope with the ravages of old age, reducing stiffness, aches and pains. I like my work. I like knowing that I can help relieve pain and suffering in others. I know that it helps heal me too. I no longer play basketball but I try to stay fit. Mostly, I practice yoga and meditation, and when the weather is warm, I like to pedal my bike up long, steep hills. It all feels like a step in the right direction: away from a very dark and lonely place, toward the person I was before all this happened. Instead of looking back, I am looking forward to looking forward. I want to get to the place where the person I was meant to be gets a second chance. I know that I still have room to grow. I would like to acknowledge some of the people who have helped me get here today. I will always be grateful for their counsel, friendship and support. First of all, my lawyers Dolores Troiani and Bebe Kivitz. These two smart, courageous women have been there for me since the beginning. Without them, I would never have been able to navigate this legal and emotional minefield. I will also be eternally grateful to Kevin Steele, the district attorney of Montgomery county, who had the guts to believe in me, in the truth, and for trusting that the justice system could get things right- even if the process had to be repeated. I also want to thank Mr Steele incredible team of professionals. including assistant district attorneys Kristen Feden and Stewart Ryan, Detectives Richard Schaffer, Mike Shade, Harry Hall, Jim Reape, Erin Slight, Kiersten McDonald, victims services and many others, for their passion for justice, their skill and their hard work and perseverance despite the odds. Thank you to the jurors for their civic duty and great sacrifices. Thank you to all of the friends, old and new, who have stood by me. You know who you are, and each and every one of you has made a huge difference. Please know that. Last but not least, I want to thank my incredible family: my mother, Gianna, and my father, Andrew, my sister Diana, her husband Stuart and their beautiful daughters – my nieces Andrea and Melanie.

90,"India top court has ruled that adultery is no longer a crime, declaring that the colonial-era law is unconstitutional and discriminatory against women. A five-judge bench of the supreme court unanimously ruled that the criminal offence of having a sexual relationship with a woman without her husband consent was archaic and deprived women of agency. The case, brought by an Indian businessman living in Italy, sought to have section of the Indian penal code and another similar provision made gender neutral. But the court said the offence, which carried a prison sentence of up to five years, was arbitrary and needed to go. “It is time to say husband is not the master,” said the chief justice, Dipak Misra. He quoted John Stuart Mill: “Legal subordination of one sex over another is wrong in itself.” Indu Malhotra, one of two women among the judges on the court, said: “The time when wives were invisible to the law, and lived in the shadows of their husbands, has long since gone by.” There is no official data on how frequently men were prosecuted under the law, but it was often raised in divorce proceedings, lawyers say. The decision is one of several socially progressive rulings by the court this session. This month the justices ruled to decriminalise homosexuality , and on Friday they will decide on a case about whether women in their menstruating years can be restricted from entering Kerala state Sabarimala temple. Indian court upholds legality of world largest biometric database Like the decision to legalise homosexual acts, some advocates against the adultery law characterised Thursday decision as an act of decolonising the country Raj-era criminal code. “I welcome this judgment by the supreme court,” said Rekha Sharma, the head of India National Commission for Women. “It was an outdated law, which should have been removed long back. This is a law from British era. Although the British had done away with it long back, we were still stuck with it.” The court has been more willing to affirm British-era legislation when it comes to restricting speech, in recent years endorsing imperial laws against criminal defamation and creating (but later dropping) a rule that Indians must stand while the national anthem is played in movie theatres. “I wouldn’t yet call it a progressive era in the court,” said Gautam Bhatia, a Delhi-based lawyer and legal scholar. He said in cases such as the adultery or homosexuality rulings, the court was dispensing with laws that had clearly fallen behind social mores. “These are the low-hanging fruit,” he said. Thursday decision was decried by some prominent feminists including Swati Maliwal, Delhi commissioner for women. She said the adultery law should have become gender neutral because it could be a deterrent against men abandoning their families, in a society where women wield little power, especially in poorer or deeply patriarchal areas of the country. “Thousands of women approach the commission, many from disadvantaged backgrounds, saying their husbands are acting in an adulterous manner and have left them without support to look after the children,” Maliwal said. “At least with this law a woman can get a sense of justice, and the men have a kind of fear that when they enter a relationship, it has some sanctity that they have to live with. “In an ideal society I would totally agree with this judgment, but we are not talking about an ideal society,” she said. Lawyers for the central government had opposed scrapping the adultery law, arguing that diluting sanctions against infidelity would “result in laxity of the marital bonds”. The law had survived three previous legal challenges, the most recent in The succession of high-profile cases provides a notable send-off for Misra, an at times controversial chief justice who has been the subject of public complaints from his fellow judges over his handling of politically sensitive cases. The Delhi high court is currently examining another law that makes an exception for sexual assault if the perpetrator and victim are married. The government as well as several men rights groups have filed petitions against scrapping the marriage exception. Karuna Nundy, a supreme court lawyer leading the case to overturn the marital rape law, said Thursday judgment bolstered her argument. “Both laws based on the doctrine of a man owning his wife, the wife being property,” she said. Nundy said the court had shown in recent judgments that it now believed “sexually autonomy is not forfeited at the marital door”.",746,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/adultery-is-not-a-crime-india-top-court-rules
91,"The Philippines is to deploy hundreds of riot police to the holiday island Boracay to keep out tourists and head off potential protests ahead of its six-month closure to visitors . Rodrigo Duterte has described the tiny central island and its white-sand beach as a “cesspool”. The Philippine president ordered visitors to be kept away from April to enable facilities to treat raw sewage to be set up and illegal structures to be torn down. On Tuesday, authorities unveiled a lockdown plan to keep out all foreign and Filipino tourists using more than police officers, including a “crowd dispersal unit”. Speaking at a public forum aired on national television, Ch Supt Cesar Binag, the regional police director, said: “In any transition, especially for a drastic action such as this, there is always confusion, uncertainties and low morale. “What we did was to identify the sources of confusion, sources of uncertainty and sources of low morale that might result to agitation and eventually into a security issue.” Boracay residents will be obliged to carry new identification cards and will be banned from boating and night swimming, he said. Entry to the island, located miles south of Manila, will be limited to one small seaport. Island residents’ identity cards are expected to be distributed three days before the shutdown, and security forces will conduct a “capability demonstration” next week, Binag said. Businesses in the area, which previously lobbied for a phased rehabilitation, have warned that an abrupt shutdown could lead to bankruptcies and job losses for many of the island hotel, restaurant and other tourism workers, plus construction workers. The island attracted million visitors last year, earning the country more than in tourism revenue, according to official data. The abrupt decision to close Boracay forced hundreds of hotels, restaurants, tour operators and other businesses to cancel bookings. The threat of closure first emerged in February, when Duterte accused Boracay businesses of dumping sewage directly into the island turquoise waters. “I will close Boracay. Boracay is a cesspool,” he said in a speech in his home city of Davao. The government maintains that it is legal to deploy police and bar tourists from the island.",362,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/philippines-sends-riot-police-to-lock-down-cesspool-boracay
92,"The Philippines has announced its best-known holiday island Boracay will be closed to tourists for six months over concerns that the once idyllic white-sand resort has become a “cesspool” tainted by dumped sewage. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the shutdown to start on April, his spokesman Harry Roque said on Twitter, without providing further detail. Beach from Leonardo DiCaprio film to temporarily close due to tourist damage The decision raises questions about the livelihoods of thousands employed as part of a bustling tourist trade that serves two million guests on the island each year. Boracay has tourism-related businesses, which had a combined revenue of pesos last year. But in February Duterte blasted the island hotels, restaurants and other businesses, accusing them of dumping sewage directly into the sea and turning it into a “cesspool”. Officials warned the island drainage system is being used to send the untreated sewage into its surrounding turquoise waters. The environment ministry says businesses, along with more than residential customers, are not connected to sewer lines. In February the government said a total of businesses faced “evaluation” for sanitary or other offences on the island, of which had already been handed warnings for violating environmental regulations. Environment undersecretary Jonas Leones said last month a closure would involve having airlines and ferries suspend Boracay services, making the beaches off-limits and stationing police there “if necessary”. “An iron fist is needed to bring it back to its previous condition. It will be a temporary thing,” Leones said. A business association on the island asked the government to shut down only those violating laws. “It unfair for compliant establishments to be affected by the closure,” Boracay Foundation Pia Miraflores said. Miraflores said even before the ban was announced, its shadow had hit some businesses hard in Boracay. “The tour guides have already complained that they have no more guests. There already a huge effect,” she said, adding the quays and jetties were “less crowded” than before.

93,"A British diver has captured shocking images of himself swimming through a sea of plastic rubbish off the coast of the Indonesian tourist resort of Bali. A short video posted by diver Rich Horner on his social media account and on YouTube shows the water densely strewn with plastic waste and yellowing food wrappers, the occasional tropical fish darting through the deluge. Bali hopes to regain paradise island status with mass cleanup The footage was shot at a dive site called Manta Point, a cleaning station for the large rays on the island of Nusa Penida, about from the popular Indonesian holiday island of Bali. In a Facebook post on March Horner writes how the ocean currents had carried in a “lovely gift” of jellyfish and plankton, and also mounds and mounds of plastic. “Plastic bags, plastic bottles, plastic cups, plastic sheets, plastic buckets, plastic sachets, plastic straws, plastic baskets, plastic bags, more plastic bags, plastic, plastic,” he says, “So much plastic!” The video shows Horner swimming through the mess for several minutes and also how the waste coagulated on the surface, mixing in with some organic matter to form a slick of floating rubbish. Manta Point is regularly frequented by numerous manta rays that visit the site to get cleaned of parasites by smaller fish, but the video shows just one lone manta in the background. “Surprise, surprise, there weren’t many mantas there at the cleaning station today...” notes Horner, “They mostly decided not to bother.” Rubbish has been inundating Bali for several months now, washing over mainly from the neighbouring island of Java during the annual rainy, or “trash” season. The plastic deluge also ends up in unsightly mounds on Bali beaches, horrifying tourists and environmentalists alike. Indonesia produces about tons of plastic and solid waste every day, with about half of that reaching landfill sites, according to the Bali-based, Rivers, Oceans, Lakes and Ecology (ROLE) Foundation. The rest is either illegally burned or dumped in Indonesia rivers and oceans. With poor government planning and low levels of awareness about waste and recycling, Indonesia is now the second-largest plastic polluter in the world after China. Several weeks ago thousands across Bali took part in a mass clean up , in attempt to rid the island beaches, rivers and jungles of waste, and raise awareness about the harmful impacts of trash. Rich Horner said that while divers regularly see “a few clouds of plastic” in the rainy season, the slick he identified is the worst yet. Divers returned to the site the next day, he reports, by which time the slick had already moved on, “continuing on its journey, off into the Indian Ocean”.",445,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/plastic-british-diver-films-sea-rubbish-bali-indonesia

The decision follows a demonstration in Chiang Mai last week in which more than people protested against the construction of a luxury development earmarked to house judges in the foothills of the Doi Suthep mountains. The demonstration was one of the largest since Thailand junta took power in a coup. It was also one of a growing number of anti-government protests, including in Bangkok, that are putting pressure on the government before a general election planned for early Green ribbons symbolising the environmental movement have appeared in public places in Chiang Mai, including on lamp posts and on cars, over the past week. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha sent Suwaphan Tanyuvardhana, one of his senior officials, to Chiang Mai on Sunday to talk to protest leaders. “We have concluded that no one will be living in this housing estate,” Suwaphan said after a meeting with the activists. The area will eventually be restored to the forest, he added. The government would form a committee with activists and representatives from the local community to determine the future use of the land currently under development, which includes houses, he said. A decision will be taken later this week, but construction of the homes already under way would have to continue for the government to honour its agreement with the construction firm involved. Activists hailed the decision as a victory. “What we have now is a promise that Doi Suthep forest will be restored,” said Teerasak Roopsuwan, one of the movement leaders. “I think this could be a model for other parts of the country that public projects must not only be legal, but they must also consider local people opinions.”",310,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/06/thai-activists-claim-victory-over-luxury-housing-on-forest-land

The gathering on Sunday was one of the largest since Thailand junta took power following a coup.

He said the organisers made a proper request for the gathering beforehand and so the protest was allowed to proceed. Protesters, many wearing green ribbons, demanded the government demolish the new buildings that encroach into Doi Suthep mountain, saying the government must comply in seven days or face more protests. Public officials have defended the project, pointing out construction was legal and on state-owned land that does not encroach into the national park covering the mountain. Officials also said protesters could face legal action if the housing was demolished and that the homes should be used for years before the public could reassess any environmental impact.

96,"t is rare, under Thailand oppressive military regime, for political feathers to be publicly ruffled. Campaigning is banned and dissidents and activists are regularly thrown in jail. But Thai newspapers were abuzz last week with talk of democracy and political accountability thanks mainly to one man, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Charismatic and wealthy, Thanathorn is the co-founder of Future Forward, which was formed in March after the electoral commission allowed new parties to register for the first time in five years, with a view to a possible election in Others parties also sprang up in March but few have had the immediate impact of Future Forward, with its progressive agenda and billionaire auto tycoon at the helm. In fact, the party captured so much public attention that the ruling military junta quickly pressed the electoral commission to void its registration. Thanathorn, who has drawn comparison to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the decision to step aside from the business world and commit himself full-time to politics in such an oppressive climate was one he had not taken lightly. “I know that by starting this party, it seriously means I might go to jail tomorrow,” he said. “But there no other way we can make a positive change in this country until there is a new political party of the people.” Thailand has been run by the army since Prayuth Chan-ocha, a general, seized power in bloodless coup in . Prayuth junta enjoyed considerable public support when it took power, but criticism of its often repressive policies and lack of transparency has grown. Prayuth has promised elections next year, though he has made similar promises several times previously and then delayed the balloting. Political parties may have been tentatively allowed but campaigning is still banned, and Thanathorn was cautious about discussing his intentions. “I have to be careful about my words because the situation here is …” he began, before trailing off. After a pause, he added: “I’ll try to be as honest as possible.” His hesitancy was not unfounded: people have been arrested in the past month for peacefully demonstrating in favour of elections. Thanathorn said he had received multiple death threats. Until recently, politics was only a sideline for Thanathorn, who made his fortune as executive vice-president and director of the Thai Summit group, which makes car parts. But in December he met up with Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, a popular legal scholar and one of Thailand most outspoken pro-democracy voices, to discuss forming the political party they had felt for years had been absent from Thai politics. By January, it was decided. “I never, ever thought I would be a politician,” said Thanathorn. “I am happy with my life, I’ve got a good balance work-life and spiritually I am quite happy. The problem is that there are millions of people in Thailand being oppressed, and I realised I just cannot live with that.” Duncan McCargo, an expert on Thai politics, expressed doubt that Future Forward could have any substantial impact. But he said: “The excitement, which might be bogus excitement, around the Future Forward party is partly because people haven’t had anything to get their teeth into for so long. “There definitely a change of mood on the ground, and where Future Forward could succeed is with young voters who have felt alienated from politics.” Thanathorn idealism may have made him an appealing political prospect to an increasingly restless young, educated, urban electorate, but many Thais are sceptical. There are grave doubts that he could win over voters in the rural north, and his lack of experience would be no match for the military or Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister deposed in another military coup in who appears to be plotting a return in In order to make any impact in Thai politics, placating the military has always been seen as essential – there have been military coups or coup attempts in Thailand since – but Thanathorn has no intention of welding his party to its influence. “Never again,” he said bluntly. “We want to champion the reduction of the military power in Thai politics …You don’t have to control conflict with violence – you don’t have to take control from the electorate to solve conflict.” Among other things, Future Forward wants to rewrite the constitution, tackle police corruption and embark on a massive decentralisation campaign – a wildly ambitious plan for a country where democracy is absent on a national level, let alone a local one. Thanathorn is under no illusions about the system his party is operating in, and he has very little confidence that the election will even happen – election plans have already been pushed back multiple times. Future Forward ambitions were focused far beyond that, he said. “Will the next election bring about democracy in Thailand? My answer there is firmly no. “The laws, the constitution, are incompatible with democracy, the justice system is not compatible with democracy. So that why when we talk about bringing democracy back into this society, we are talking about something more long term, maybe five years, years, maybe even years. It is a long-term war and the next election will just be the first battle.”",866,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/01/thanathorn-juangroongruangkit-thai-tycoon-trying-to-take-on-the-junta

Jason Parnell, from Sileby in Leicestershire, who was also killed, was celebrating his first wedding anniversary with his wife Puja.

The dark side of wildlife tourism: thousands of Asian elephants held in cruel conditions The accident took place on Monday morning in the northern city of Chiang Mai, just after the owner, Somsak Riengngen, unchained the five-tonne elephant, called Ekasit. With a mahout, or handler, on his back, Ekasit took a few steps before reversing course and attacking Somsak, who was on the ground. “The elephant suddenly turned back and used his trunk to grab the victim. Then the elephant used his trunk to crush him,” Wuthichai Muangman, acting director of Chiang Mai zoo, told AFP.

0,"Theresa May has made a bold pledge to bring a decade of austerity to a close, as she appealed to the public over the heads of her squabbling party to back her to deliver a Brexit deal. Speaking in Birmingham on Wednesday at the end of the Conservatives’ annual conference, which was marred by repeated clashes over Europe, May cast aside the chancellor concerns about the health of the country finances and signalled Brexit would mark an end to public spending cuts. Despite widespread speculation about her future, May also made several domestic policy announcements in an attempt to show she has not been blown off course by Brexit or noisy critics led by Boris Johnson . It Theresa May v Boris Johnson at the Tories’ Groundhog conference They include: Lifting the cap on local authorities borrowing to build new council homes. Setting new targets for early cancer detection as part of a new “cancer strategy”. Freezing fuel duty for the ninth consecutive year. But her most eye-catching pledge was the promise to bring to an end the decade-long programme of spending cuts imposed after the banking bailouts. “When we’ve secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the spending review next year we will set out our approach for the future,” she said. “A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off. “There must be no return to the uncontrolled borrowing of the past. No undoing all the progress of the last eight years. No taking Britain back to square one. But the British people need to know that the end is in sight. And our message to them must be this: we get it.” Dancing Queen: Theresa May steps out again Experts were sceptical about the idea of drawing a line under austerity in Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “The public and most politicians are tired of austerity, but we’re a long way off from actually ending it.” Current government plans involve continuing to reduce the deficit until the second half of the with significant cuts to many departments’ budgets pencilled in. May speech marks a significant change in rhetoric but actually ending the current era of public spending restraint will involve not words but significant tax rises and higher borrowing. The prime minister remarks were an effort to convince the public that “our future is full of promise”; but they also appeared to signal Conservative anxieties that Jeremy Corbyn anti-austerity narrative has become “the new political mainstream”, as the Labour leader claimed in his own well-received conference speech last week. In a self-deprecating move aides later insisted was unplanned, May appeared on stage dancing to Abba Dancing Queen – and made a series of pointed calls for her party to unite. “It is no surprise that we have had a range of different views expressed this week. But my job as prime minister is to do what I believe to be in the national interest,” she said. The Treasury has been keen to stress that future public spending plans will depend on the exact nature of the Brexit deal Britain secures, with the chancellor and the business secretary suggesting a Canada-style approach would lead to slower economic growth. Hammond is also closely watching the financial markets, amid fears that the next few weeks could see sharp movements in sterling and share prices as the government battles to secure a deal. But No sources said after the speech that May promise to end austerity in next year spending review, due next spring, was unconditional. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell said: “Theresa May claim that austerity is over is a con. If the prime minister wants to back up her words with action, Philip Hammond should announce immediately that the cuts scheduled for the next four years will be cancelled. “If he cannot, or will not, then Theresa May announcement today was not just empty – it was clearly a deceitful attempt to trick the public.” A day after Boris Johnson told a rapt audience in Birmingham that her Brexit plans represented a “betrayal”, May told her colleagues that if they failed to back her, Brexit could unravel altogether. “If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all,” she said. She hit back at Johnson without mentioning the former foreign secretary by name, saying: “Leadership is doing what you believe to be right, and having the courage and determination to see it through, and that what I’ve been doing on Brexit.” Speaking about Brexit voters, she said: “We put our faith in their judgment. They have put their faith in us to deliver. I will not let them down.” May did not mention her Chequers plan, which rebel Tories have been urging her to “chuck” , speaking instead about “a free-trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods”, which would “protect our precious union”. Throughout the hour-long speech, May repeatedly returned to attacking the opposition. She sought to exploit divisions in the Labour party, claiming she could see “the heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Denis Healey and John Smith”, in today Labour party but not on the frontbench. “Instead, their faces stare blankly out from the rows behind, while another party occupies prime position: the Jeremy Corbyn party,” she said, claiming the Labour frontbench “rejects the common values that once bridged our political divide”. Corbyn has been criticised repeatedly from the platform by cabinet ministers this week, underlining the fact that senior Conservatives regard Labour as a serious electoral threat . May said that in contrast to Labour, the Conservatives should appeal to voters as “a party that is decent, moderate, and patriotic. One that puts the national interest first. Delivers on the issues they care about. And is comfortable with modern Britain in all its diversity.” May also bemoaned the toxic nature of public debate, citing the murdered MP Jo Cox argument that political opponents have “more in common than divides us”. “Rigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies,” she said. “You don’t have to believe in a word Diane Abbott says to believe in her right to say it, free of abuse.”",1064,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/theresa-may-conference-speech-ambasts-labour-as-she-calls-for-tory-unity
1,"Party unity No mention was made of Boris Johnson in Theresa May address but her call for unity in the speech Brexit section was clearly aimed at him and his supporters on the right of the Tory party. “There another reason why we need to come to together. We are entering the toughest phase of the negotiations,” May said, implying that any leadership or other political challenge at this moment would weaken the country position. “If we stick together and hold our nerve I know we can get a deal that delivers for Britain.” There was a further thinly veiled reference to criticism made by Johnson and others of her Chequers negotiating approach. “The people we serve are not interested in debates about the theory of Brexit – their livelihoods depend on making a success of it in practice,” she said in a section of the speech drafted by her chief of staff Gavin Barwell. But while she effectively restated the Chequers position in remarks, she did not use the descriptive term, and instead, borrowing from the language of the hard Brexiters, said she was proposing “a free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods”. It was “no surprise that we have had a range of different views expressed this week” May added, referring to the often packed hard Brexit fringe events. “But my job as prime minister is to do what I believe to be in the national interest.” Labour The prime minister devoted substantial portions of her speech to attacking Jeremy Corbyn Labour party, a sign arguably that the Conservatives are worried by the threat they pose following a relatively successful opposition conference at Liverpool. Theresa May scraps borrowing cap for councils to build new homes – Politics live She tried to magnify divisions within Labour , saying “the heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Denis Healey and John Smith” were not on the frontbench. “Their faces stare blankly from the rows behind while another party occupies prime position: the Jeremy Corbyn party.” Name-checking a series of past Labour leaders, she provocatively asked “would Clement Attlee, Churchill trusted deputy during the second world war, have told the British Jews they didn’t know the meaning of antisemitism?” in an attempt to her paint her party as occupying “a decent, moderate and patriotic” centre-ground. On two occasions in the speech, May also stole from Corbyn “for the many, not the few” slogan – suggesting that she recognises its power. In her formulation, the Conservatives needed “to be a party not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules” – words used in her anti-Labour passage early in the speech and virtually repeated near the end. Theresa May conference speech: what the verdict? | Matthew d’Ancona and others End of austerity It is all very well for Theresa May to declare an end to the Conservative party austerity policies – but according to her government current plans it still full steam ahead. Barring a U-turn in the budget later this month, the government will continue to freeze household benefits until at least while welfare cap restrictions on certain types of support will remain until at least Universal credit will be introduced in more parts of the country in the coming months to noisy opposition, while there is still a benefit cap on the total amount of support households can receive. Though it has yet to factor in the impact of the increase in NHS spending, the last time the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast the proportion of government spending as a percentage of GDP, state expenditure was expected to fall in every year until May promise makes life difficult for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has said he will continue to pursue a “balanced approach” to state spending and tax receipts – with the aim of continuing to cut the deficit. The public finances have improved in recent years, handing the chancellor the potential headroom to lift spending. Hammond is within the deficit to GDP government target, and would have to spend by if he maintains the deficit at this level until However, Brexit could make him reluctant to spend just now, given the dire warnings for the economy and the public finances from a no-deal scenario. The Tories have also pledged a budget surplus by the which would make him reluctant to raise spending. The OBR forecasts that, even if spending was allowed to rise to take account of the extra health costs of an ageing population, the deficit would remain roughly flat over the four years to – so something has to give.

The aim is to increase the proportion of people diagnosed early with the disease from to by That would mean that by more people would be alive five years after being diagnosed compared with today. This will be achieved by reducing the age at which bowel cancer screening starts in England from to the NHS buying the latest scanners and building more rapid diagnostic centres or “one-stop shops” where patients can have a scan quickly. The plan will be set out more fully in a new cancer strategy, which will be a key element of the NHS forthcoming plan setting out how it will spend its extra budget by These are ambitious plans to tackle one of the enduring weaknesses of healthcare in Britain – that cancer diagnosis rates, and thus patients’ chances of survival, are among the worst among OECD countries. However, much of what May announced could be undermined by the growing difficulty NHS cancer services are having recruiting and retaining enough doctors and nurses. Housing Theresa May knows well that whichever party comes up with the best solution to the housing crisis could hold the keys to the next election. But the government has struggled so far to fix the broken housing market. Last year, her chancellor, Philip Hammond, increased the cap on how much councils could borrow against their housing revenue account to Town halls welcomed the move but said it didn’t go far enough. Local authorities have long called for the cap to be scrapped in its entirety, arguing that it would free them up to build tens of thousands affordable homes, helping the government meet its target of new homes a year. However, until now the Treasury held out against several local government secretaries, Sajid Javid notable among them, arguing the debt would have to go on the national balance sheet and would make deficit reduction targets harder to reach. But now, according to No the fiscal prudence has paid off – even with the uncertainties of Brexit looming large – creating more room for manoeuvre public spending without impacting too heavily on the nation books. “Solving the housing crisis is the biggest domestic policy challenge of our generation,” May told Tory delegates. “It doesn’t make sense to stop councils from playing their part in solving it.”",1184,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/the-five-key-themes-of-theresa-may-conference-speech
2,"Accommodating Muslims and Hindus “robs Britain of its community” and risks turning the country into a “crime-riddled cesspool” as a result, the Conservative candidate for London mayor declared in a thinktank pamphlet he wrote a decade ago. Shaun Bailey voiced concerns about the marking of Muslim and Hindu festivals, claimed children were being taught more about Diwali than Christmas, and argued Britain “removing the religion that British people generally take to” had allowed immigrants to bring their countries’ cultural problems with them. In his “no man land” pamphlet (pdf) for the Centre for Policy Studies about the problems faced by young people in inner-city areas, Bailey also appeared to confuse Hindi speakers with the Hindu religion. “You bring your children to school and they learn far more about Diwali than Christmas. I speak to the people who are from Brent and they’ve been having Muslim and Hindi days off. What it does is rob Britain of its community. Without our community, we slip into a crime-riddled cesspool,” he wrote in “There are a lot of really good things about Britain as a place and British people as a body. But by removing the religion that British people generally take to, by removing the ethics that generally go with it, we’ve allowed people to come to Britain and bring their culture, their country and any problems they might have, with them.” A few paragraphs later, Bailey argued it was easier for the black community to integrate into British society because there were shared Christian values. “Within the black community, it is not such a bad thing, because we’ve shared a religion and in many cases a language. It far easier for black people to integrate,” he said. A section of Bailey pamphlet headed “multiculturalism” set out his arguments about religion in the UK, and suggested that without the sense of community that comes from shared Christian celebrations, Britain had produced a nation of people who would not fight for the country. Despite the revelations, Theresa May endorsed Bailey in her keynote speech at the Conservative party conference. A few hours after the Guardian article about his pamphlet was first published, May, arguing her party represented equality of opportunity, cited the example of Bailey. She said a man whose “grandparents came to our shores as part of the Windrush generation … could be the next mayor of London”. Bailey was selected as the Tory candidate for London mayor at the end of last week, comfortably winning a three-way contest after two rounds of voting. He was a youth worker who became an adviser to David Cameron on young people and crime before being elected to the London assembly, having previously failed to win a seat at Westminster. Labour seized on Bailey remarks. Andy Slaughter, a London Labour MP who defeated him in the general election, said: “It is increasingly clear that he holds views that are at best divisive and at worst Islamophobic. London went through this once before with Zac Goldsmith hideous campaign for mayor and, quite frankly, we deserve much better than this from the Conservative party.” Goldsmith losing campaign against Sadiq Khan in was first criticised for attempting to divide voters when leaflets targeting Hindu voters emerged, in which it was suggested Khan would tax their jewellery if he became London mayor. The next mayoral election is due in spring A spokesperson for Bailey said: “As a descendant of the Windrush generation, and someone who has worked with diverse communities for over years, Shaun knows full well the challenges faced by BAME communities. “Shaun has made it his life work to help those from migrant and disadvantaged communities, and to suggest otherwise is ludicrous. “As someone who has received racist abuse from the Labour party, who, let not forget, branded the community worker a ‘token ghetto boy’ , this is a little rich.” A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain said: “For a mayoral candidate to have used such grotesque language about Muslims and Hindus is totally unacceptable. Bailey needs to apologise and distance himself from this divisive bigotry.” The organisation said it would write to the Tories to see if they were aware of Bailey remarks prior to his selection.",703,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/tories-london-mayor-pick-shaun-bailey-multiculturalism-robs-britain-of-its-community
3,"hen David Cameron held his referendum to “settle the issue of Europe for a generation”, I wonder if he envisaged a Conservative party conference like this one taking place more than two years after the fact. It is the third conference since the EU referendum, and the second since article was triggered. The Tories are still fighting their forever war; we all just have to live in it. MPs who should, years ago, have been relegated to the status of taxidermal curiosities, still stalk these lands. “I see some people are here who were part of the original Maastricht referendum campaign,” bellowed Bill Cash at some deranged fringe event. “Give them a clap!” Give them the clap, more like. “Last week was the anniversary of Margaret Thatcher Bruges speech,” ran another rallying cry. Somewhere at this gathering in Birmingham, it was always o’clock. It as if there some tear in the Tory-bastardry continuum. Who going to fix it? Theresa May, who mostly resembles a Quentin Blake drawing of an unravelling postmistress? Boris Johnson , the Cabbage Patch Draco Malfoy, who turned up for about an hour and bottled his big fight? Or perhaps you prefer some of the other prospects. Jeremy Hunt? Sajid Javid? Liz Truss?! Still, take up your tiki torches and join me at the Tory survivors’ tribal council, which felt as though it lasted at least days. The conference slogan – “OPPORTUNITY” – was not so much phoned in as faxed in. That is it in its entirety. “OPPORTUNITY”. As in, we had an opportunity to choose something that didn’t sound as if it was thought up by a small-portfolio buy-to-let landlord whose wife was calling up the stairs: “Can you hurry, Les – Kwikprint shuts at six?” The slogan called to mind that line in The Thick of It when the night editor says: “Just tell me what the fucking news is and I’ll stick it on the front page. It not like we’re the Independent, I can’t just stick a headline saying ‘CRUELTY’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it.” As it turned out, “OPPORTUNITY” was a slogan that mainly had some floundering secretary of state stuck underneath it. The story of this conference was one of a government unable to remotely fill the main hall for its cabinet speakers, while activists queued round the block for fringe events protesting against its central policy. Javid, highly fancied for the Tory leadership, couldn’t even come close to packing the hall at his own party conference. Three individuals, and what they represented, dominated these four days: May herself, Johnson absent) and Jacob Rees-Mogg. We shall come to these dramatis personae shortly. As for the big policy announcements, there is a pop art comic strip where a sobbing woman is saying : “I can’t believe it. I forgot to have children.” This, but for policies. The Tories had forgotten to have any policies. If your answer to “What is going to win us back Canterbury?” is “Action on middle-class cocaine users,” you must actually be on cocaine. May ludicrous “festival of national renewal” idea was immediately dubbed the festival of Brexit Britain. You’ve heard of straight-to-DVD; May policy agenda is now straight-to-meme . The only retail offer here was literal retail. As always, there were a wide range of shopping opportunities for activists. I saw several men being measured for a suit, as you do at a party conference. I saw a huge amount of felted goods and ceramic jewellery. I saw lots of Conservative baby bibs. (Interesting to market your logo as something that specifically is going to get thrown up on.) But on with the main event. It was difficult not to conclude that the Tory party has been gamified in a way that rewards aggressive imbecility. The signal that you wish to be taken seriously as leadership material is to say something incredibly stupid. For Jeremy Hunt, that meant declaring, pointedly: “The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.” Yes. Last year the EU was Hitler; this year it is Stalin. Like almost every minister who has insulted the other side in this negotiation since article was triggered, Hunt predicated his trash talk on the idea that the EU doesn’t have the internet, and that this sort of WTF-ery is somehow firewalled by the white cliffs of Dover. It isn’t, as furious condemnation from the people we want a deal off has since confirmed. Furthermore, if you ever wonder what has happened to our political discourse in recent times, consider that years ago this level of analysis was the preserve of imaginatively limited internet commenters. “EUSSR” took its place below the line, alongside such exquisitely crafted points as “Tony Bliar” or “ZANU Liarbore”. EUSSR is now the sort of thing the actual foreign secretary says on an actual conference stage. The best thing you could say about Hunt speech was that it wasn’t being made by Philip Hammond, who still delivers lines with all the rhetorical flourish of a reversing Securicor vehicle. If you wanted to hide pictures of Johnson blowing rails with Donald Trump, inside a Hammond speech would be the perfect place. Indeed, the chancellor did stash some fairly outre material in his dirge, such as the statement “the Conservative party is sceptical of ideologues”. Even less appealing was Gavin Williamson, who continues to look as though he took the rejection letter from Starfleet Academy pretty hard. Still, the defence secretary is going to start his own force of “cyber cadets”. Alas, to watch him make repeated pauses for laughter that never came was to watch a man finding out in real time that he isn’t going to captain this particular starship. Other lowlights? That old reverse Midas, Chris Grayling, being late for his own speech, which turned out to be the replacement bus service of oratory. And then there was Dominic Raab. Soap operas that have seriously lost their way often deploy an “ evil twin ” device. I can only assume that this is what has happened to the Tory telenovela. Raab is playing both roles simultaneously. He devoted much of his speech to lambasting Cassandra-like warnings about a no-deal Brexit. “This time [they’ll] claim that no deal means patients won’t get their medicines, mobile phone roaming charges will go through the roof and –” Dominic? DOMINIC??? Sorry to cut you off, but those were the impact assessments put out by your own department, of which you are the secretary of state. “Honestly,” Raab continued ironicidally, “it would be pathetic if it wasn’t so dangerous.” And with that, we can avoid him no longer. Johnson had almost full-spectrum dominance of this conference. Talked about feverishly by attendees, his moves endlessly speculated upon – the effect is to make the entire event seem like a lavish party missing only its host. Think of Boris as the Great Twatsby. The effect of much of his manoeuvring this week was to remind us that he is someone so far away from having a clue that he constantly suggests building a bridge to it. Does Johnson even have a psychoanalyst? Like several of the worst men of the age, he appears to deem high office the place to explore issues that really should be worked out via his dream journal. Still, here comes the Unaboris with his manifesto, ready to commit another act of political terrorism. His fringe speech on Tuesday chastised a government for which he was collectively responsible for two whole years; his Sunday Telegraph manifesto was a document in which not a whole lot of detail was manifest. The former foreign secretary reputation as a rousing prose stylist remains baffling. Johnson writes like someone who has failed to enable the find-my-point function on his phone. Even so, the word-dump ensured the prime minister couldn’t even get pre-title billing for her own conference. Three full days into this psychodrama, May was asked on the Today programme what she would say to Johnson. Chat shit get banged , surely? Unfortunately, she went with : “What I would say is, ‘I’m concentrating on what is important, which is getting a good deal for the UK.’” Thus it was left to others to do the banging of the shit-chatter. There was a strong sense among MPs here that they are so very, very tired of Johnson that they can’t even be bothered being artful about it. “As far as I’m concerned,” Henley MP John Howell reflected , “Boris can just fuck off.” The Scottish Tories have launched a campaign to stop him becoming party leader, under the name Operation Arse . As one put it: “We called it that so we’d be clear who we were talking about.” Asked what the big challenge for the Tories was, the former minister Lord O’Neill judged: “I guess key people in this party have to stop being dickheads, really.” So quite a lot was hinging on Johnson speech. Unfortunately, Johnson has a psychological tell, where he likes to see Britain as the sort of country that is so sexually potent it could impregnate the rest of the world just by looking at it. In last year election, I saw him rage that sending Trident to sea with no missiles on board would mean “the whole country literally firing blanks”. In Tuesday Birmingham speech, he announced that he had come to “put some lead in the collective pencil”. Again, one for the psychoanalyst from the Tories’ vote-for-your-id candidate. As he knows, Johnson hasn’t anywhere near the numbers among MPs to get his name on the members’ ballot in any leadership contest. So Tuesday speech, however rapturously received till that point, concluded thus: “I urge our friends in government to deliver what the people voted for, to back Theresa May in the best way possible, by softly, quietly and sensibly backing her original plan.” Thank you, Cuck Norris. Until Johnson finally turned up in Birmingham, his place in the activists’ affections was occupied by that appalling bacillus Rees-Mogg. Hey – if you can’t have the lead singer, you’ll settle for the roadie. I enjoyed him most on how the Tories can win the youth vote. Rees-Mogg, who spent his youth being seems to think that all the youths he speaks to want to take back control of their laws, their money and their borders. It is to be assumed the data sample was the members of Durham University Conservative Students he met when he blew into town to debate some motion like: “This House Would Nationalise Gemma Collins”. Never ones to be rushed, the Tories seem to have finally realised that people want houses, and were consequently free to move on to arguing their way to deadlock on what sort of houses they should build. Rees-Mogg is against the plan to build the sort of houses that people don’t want, and instead wants “Georgian pastiche houses”. Also he wants a bridge (who doesn’t?). He said he wanted the Bath bypass to be “a Georgian pastiche bridge with little pavilions at both ends”. The problem with Rees-Mogg saying “pastiche” every seconds is that it reminds you he is one. Still, they absolutely lap it up here. He pointed out to one pantwettingly amused audience that he wore his conference security pass on a buttonhole chain. “It the one thing I learned from Michael Heseltine.” This particular event had required Rees-Mogg to enter via a staircase, and he is almost at the stage of dancing down it at that sideways angle of the light-entertainment host. A barrage of cameras attends his every affectation. “Oh, poor Jacob,” cooed a woman in front of me. “He just trying to sit quietly in the front row until he called to speak.” Madam, I regret to inform you that this is a defective take. You are as entitled to your fantasy of a knee-trembler in the scullery as the next forelock-tugger, but the camera at which Rees-Mogg does not wish to affect lengthy surprise has yet to be found. Meanwhile, he never fails to give them what they want. “As you would expect,” began a typical piece of self-reference, “I’m going to give you a historic analogy.” Explaining that he was happy with a “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Canada” Brexit model, Rees-Mogg noted: “That is a word developed by a nanny and nannies are jolly good things.” Time and again this week, the likes of Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Andrea Jenkyns suggested that no deal was much the preferred outcome, as then we wouldn’t have to pay the EU of your money”. “Why aren’t we doing that anyway?”, they kept saying, to loud applause. But please don’t imagine they haven’t thought it all through in remorseless analytical detail. “Brexit will be a success,” explained Rees-Mogg, “because it is a Conservative thing to be doing.” As for the prime minister, her own speech was entitled “Campaign a prospect radically more depressing than even “Qatar Thanks to last year calamity, any speech in which she doesn’t cough up a lung is a positive. But her wide-ranging, Abba-dancing turn as the unity candidate was strongly applauded in the conference hall, seemingly as something other than self-satire. So here is where we are at the end of this conference. Theresa May is still prime minister. Boris Johnson still wants to be prime minister. And somewhere in a shepherd hut, David Cameron is sleeping easily, tweeting his pedicures and continually popping his memoirs back a few months in the hope that his mess will have been cleaned up by publication date. Yet if Labour are comforted by this shitshow, they must consider its implications as far as their own performance markers go. Imagine not having a poll lead over this lot. “Don’t know” still outpolls both May and Jeremy Corbyn as to who would make the best prime minister. This is Groundhog Year. For all their big talk, and their dick-waving, and their self-started fights with minority communities , both parties are exactly where they were a year ago in the poll tracker , even as various doomsday clocks have ticked closer to midnight. Whether or not they can admit it to themselves, both parties (though Labour more so, being the opposition) are effectively waiting for a crisis to shift the numbers in their favour. No deal, a recession, a welfare system failure – the best hope for moving the polls is one disaster or another befalling the people whom their different forms of ineptitude have already shamefully failed. That is the most likely gamechanger – and a reminder that however atrocious the current state of politics feels, it is still not the darkest timeline. There are much darker ones, and we could easily cross into several of them.",2469,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/theresa-may-tory-conference-boris-johnson-marina-hyde

5,"As she ended her speech in Birmingham, May fired the starting gun on a fortnight of intense and potentially historic negotiations between the EU and the UK which could rupture or repair deteriorated relations. While the expectation of a breakthrough on Brexit have been lowered, all sides, particularly Brussels and Dublin, have been waiting for the Tory party conference to end before the real work of hammering out a deal begins behind closed doors. All parties are braced for a frantic fortnight, with senior sources on the Brussels side saying: “We are ready for this. The British are ready. Everyone is ready. All sides are up for a deal, but we need this to happen behind closed doors with an end to the leaks.” There are days to go before the crunch EU summit on October, the original deadline for the Brexit deal. Thursday October The EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is due to meet the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar. The EU new version of the backstop, which will be “substantially different” to the proposal in March to keep Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union, will be the focus. This is widely expected to include regulatory and customs checks away from the border. Friday October Michelle O’Neill, the leader of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland, will meet Barnier along with leaders of the region other parties: the Alliance party, the Social Democratic and Labour party and the Greens. Friday October or Monday October The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, will go to Brussels on Friday or Monday, depending on the progress of continuing talks between British and EU officials. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May de facto deputy has promised publication of the UK Irish border proposal “very soon”, possibly as early as Thursday. This has the potential to be the first flashpoint in the fortnight ahead, but sources say it may not be published until the final deal is done. If not there will be plenty of potential for leaks and bad tempers. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has told Theresa May she wants sight of the text before any deal is struck, after the DUP House of Commons leader, Nigel Dodds, told the prime minister his party would vote against any deal that involved any new regulatory or customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU is also expected to deliver its new version of the backstop. Wednesday October A critical day in the final countdown. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has pencilled in next Wednesday for the great unveiling of the EU political declaration on the future relationship with the UK. But it is “to be confirmed”. If there has not been any progress on the Irish border issue, its publication is likely to be delayed. This will be the first sign of how well, or badly, talks are going. As it stands, sources suggest that the paper is just “four to five pages” long and, apart from some extra aspirational language about deepening the trade relationship in time, the basic structure will be very similar to the Canada-style trade deal offered by the European council president, Donald Tusk , last March. The British government is expected to double down on its position that there should be a temporary customs arrangement (TCA) under which the whole of the UK would in effect stay in the customs union, while having the ability to strike free trade deals with countries around the world. The UK will also suggest that Northern Ireland could stay under EU single market regulations if the Stormont and Northern Ireland executive agree it. Wednesday October Tusk is expected to invite EU leaders, excluding May, to discuss Brexit at a working dinner on October in Brussels. It is not the only issue on their plates: the leaders, including May, are set to discuss migration, foreign policy and security at the formal summit the following day. The EU summit has been cut to one day because of a long-planned meeting on October between EU and Asian leaders. Bringing together heads of state and government from countries, the meeting could add a piquant note to Brexit talks, as the British government prepares to strike out alone in pursuit of a “global Britain”. Thursday October This has been billed as the “moment of truth” in the Brexit talks. The prime minister has already expressed her doubts that agreement on the Irish border issue can be found by the time of this summit. The UK wants the political declaration to offer a more expansive vision of the future trade deal in order to give assurances that the backstop , however it is finally formulated, is never necessary. Juncker has said he expects the meeting, which is supposed to last two days, but may be expanded to three, to be “interesting”. That appears to be diplomatic language for there being an almighty row. Theresa May lambasts Labour as she calls for Tory unity over Brexit The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has insisted that a subsequent summit in mid-November should be seen as a prize for resolution of the Irish issue. Can a solution be found within the corridors of the Europa building that satisfies both the EU and the UK? Sources on both sides admit to some bewilderment as to what this magic formula could be. November summit This meeting was first mooted by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who liked the idea of a formal goodbye to the UK, in which solemn promises of a tight friendship after Brexit could be made. With progress on the Irish issue so troublesome, and deadlines slipping, the weekend summit is likely to be much more hard work than originally envisioned. Less music and speeches, more frantic scribbling in gloomy rooms. It is not by any means certain that an agreement will be possible here. December summit Some see the talks dragging into December. It is the UK parliamentary timetable that is the problem. A certain number of weeks have been set down for votes on the withdrawal agreement. January This is also a tricky milestone. If there is no deal by this date, the British government must make a statement within five days on what the UK plans to do, according to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of",1055,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/brexit-countdown-after-tory-conference-what-happens-next
6,"Brexit – edging towards a deal? There were two Brexit narratives on display in Birmingham. From the podium, ministers struck a defiant pose, with the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, accusing the of taking a “theological” approach to negotiations. The patriotic zeal of reformed remainer Jeremy Hunt even extended to warning the EU not to fall into the trap of treating Britain as the former Soviet Union treated its satellite states. “What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream? The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving. The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish, it will grow, and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to escape,” he said, in a passage that went down predictably badly across the Channel. At a string of packed-out fringe meetings meanwhile, Jacob Rees-Mogg smartly dressed rebel army set out the reasons why the prime minister negotiating strategy would doom Britain to vassalage – and fail to win the backing of parliament. Yet away from the conference hall, ministers are increasingly hopeful that with a bit of good old British fudge, a deal can be done. And, just as importantly, they believe they have a fair hope of getting it through parliament. Ministers believe that if May returns triumphant from Brussels in November with a snatched-from-the-jaws-of-defeat deal, the whole political backdrop will change. At that point, they hope to win over a handful of Labour MPs who don’t want to be seen to block Brexit, and “burn off” some of Rees-Mogg less committed followers with the spectre of a general election, or worse (in their eyes), a second referendum. As May put it in her speech: “If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.” Oh ... Jeremy Corbyn The smart, blue-suited Tory activists filing through the national conference centre in Birmingham seemed a world away from the diverse crowd at Labour conference a week earlier, with their slogan T-shirts and stickers. But sometimes it felt as though Jeremy Corbyn name was as much on people lips here, as in Liverpool – and not just as a cartoonish throwback to the winter of discontent, but as a genuine political threat. Labour analysis of what wrong in Britain – stagnant real wages, towns left behind by globalisation, a political system out of touch with the public – in many ways framed the discussions in Birmingham. “Too many people feel that they have lost control; that they are working for the system, but the system isn’t working for them … As they look around them, they feel a growing concern that they are falling behind … And that when they voice those concerns, the political system doesn’t seem to hear them.” Those aren’t the words of John McDonnell – but of Philip Hammond, the man who when asked what adjective he would use to describe himself, once said simply, “fiscal”. “While Labour answers will solve nothing, their questions deserve a response,” he told the party faithful, underlining for the umpteenth time in Birmingham the fact that senior Conservatives now regard Labour as a serious electoral threat. Succession planning Boris Johnson yearning for the top job is well known, but a crowded field of other potential candidates put themselves through their paces in Birmingham this week. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, widely regarded as one of the strongest contenders to take on Johnson, gave a heartwarming rendition of his humble backstory, while announcing a tough new migration regime – which would almost certainly have prevented his own bus driver father from entering Britain. And a selection of other pretenders were on display too. Damian Hinds, the likable, low-key education secretary, deployed David Cameron tactic of striding around the stage without notes, as he delivered his speech, promising “a world-class education for everyone”. Responding to Corbyn at the Conservative conference – Politics Weekly podcast Matt Hancock, keeper of the Osbornite flame, who celebrated his birthday on Tuesday, offered a tour through the Tories’ reforming history that strayed considerably beyond his NHS brief. “We can’t just be comfortable with modern Britain. We’ve got to be the champions of modern Britain,” he told his party. Freedom or opportunity? With few activists expecting Theresa May still to be leading her party by the time they reconvene at next year conference, a battle of ideas, as well as of leadership contenders, was raging on the fringes at Birmingham. Many MPs see Brexit day next March as a reset moment for the Tory party, but there is no agreed answer to the question of what should come next. Former No adviser George Freeman, convenor of the Big Tent ideas festival, is one of those arguing the party needs to reform capitalism, so that it has more to offer working-class voters, even if that means state intervention. May line that “we cannot make the case for capitalism if ordinary working people have no chance of owning capital” is straight from his playbook. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, meanwhile, is the champion of a different strand of Tory thinking, focusing on freedom. She told Conservative members that young voters wanted “smart and efficient government, which has a role but doesn’t get in the way”. Young voters At last year general election, the crossover age at which the public were more likely to back the Tories than Labour was and how to appeal to younger voters has become almost an obsession for Theresa May party. There was a Youth Zone in Birmingham, in which suited politicians, at least some whom were young, chatted earnestly about how best to appeal to the – with some admitting they were embarrassed to admit their party allegiance to their friends. But the party attitude to younger voters was perhaps best summed up by the chairman of the backbench Committee, Graham Brady, who said young people “should be very good Conservatives” so long as “they haven’t inhaled something damaging and become Marxists”.",1030,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/opportunity-knocks-what-we-learned-from-the-tory-conference
7,"ook on the bright side. No one gave the prime minister a Her voice just about held out. And the video screen backdrop with the word “opportunity” on it didn’t develop a glitch and switch to “porn” instead. After avoiding all that, anything else would be near enough an unqualified success. Not that there weren’t a few awkward moments in the buildup. As members of the cabinet trooped in to the hall, it became clear there weren’t enough seats for David Lidington, Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Philip Hammond. Either they are not wanted on voyage or someone in the government can’t count. Four ordinary punters were unceremoniously hoiked out of the auditorium. Theresa May v the 'Great Twatsby' at the Tories’ Groundhog conference Then the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, chose to use his introduction as a pantomime audition. Blackadder channels Brian Blessed. The audience went wild and if the Tory party conference had ended at that point everyone would have gone home delirious. If there is a next year, Theresa May will be more careful in her choice of warm-up act. No one wants to be upstaged on their big day out. Still, at least the prime minister nailed her entrance . As Abba Dancing Queen was played through the PA system, Theresa hoofed her way on stage doing a reprise of her cringe-inducing South African Peter Crouch dance . Whatever else she has achieved in her time in office, no one can say she hasn’t worked hard at refining her Maybot image . This latest iteration looked the real deal. Britain: not just world leaders in AI, but a world leader as AI. Having won over the hall with a little self deprecation, May reverted to the more familiar territory of living down to expectations. There was no way of getting away from it: though this was one of the best speeches she had made as prime minister it was still a Theresa May speech. As such, it was riddled with contradictions, largely devoid of content and went on at least a quarter of an hour too long as the algorithms buffered in a spinning circle of death. “I want a party not for the few, not even for the many but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best,” she said. An almost perfect description of herself. No one can accuse May of not working hard or trying to do her best. It just that these qualities aren’t always quite enough in a prime minister who has turned mediocrity into an art form. What she wanted was a party where she could feel at home: whether her party actually wanted her as its leader was rather more in doubt. Many of the people who were politely applauding her had been cheering and whooping for Boris Johnson the day before . Oblivious to the pathos, May ploughed on with a plea for national unity. Seemingly unaware of the irreconcilable splits in her own party, she made the case for the Tories being the party of inclusion. “If your dad arrived on a plane from Pakistan, you can become home secretary,” she said. Yes. And once the government proposed immigration plans come into force, your dad will be on the first plane back to Pakistan. In a final, desperate, plea for someone, anyone, to love her, she begged a few Labour centrists to come and join her for a night in staring at the wall and sharing awkward silences. Then she moved on to Brexit. Here she had a genuine announcement. She had listened to the party and was going to “ chuck Chequers ”. As in “chuck the name Chequers”. She was still going to press ahead with the Brexit deal that the EU, Labour and dozens of MPs in her own party had already said was unworkable. She just wasn’t going to refer to it as Chequers any more. Instead it was going to be called “Nothing at All”. Mainly because nothing at all had so far been agreed on Northern Ireland or the future trading relationship with the EU. But once nothing at all had been agreed she was absolutely clear that austerity was going to end and we would all have lots of money even if nothing at all was agreed. No wonder everyone looked a bit confused. “Our best years lie ahead,” May declared. Thereby inadvertently drawing attention to the fact that everything had been – and still was – irredeemably awful for the past years. But as a reward we would get to enjoy a Festival of Brexit Britain in To celebrate years of rationing and the fact that not all of us had died. Lucky, lucky us. Can’t wait. As the speech neared the hour mark, most people in the hall got a bit twitchy. You can have too much of an average thing. When May finally wound to a close, the audience clapped enthusiastically. Though not too enthusiastically. This was how the Tory conference ended. Not with a bang. Not even with a whimper. But with a stampede for the exits.",854,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/too-long-devoid-content-theresa-may-conference-speech-total-success
8,"On paper, bringing on the attorney general as the surprise warm-up act for the prime minister might have seemed like an odd choice. But minutes later, in a booming speech peppered with Milton and the Rolling Stones, delighted Tory delegates were cheering to the rafters. As Geoffrey Cox, the part-time barrister strode across the stage, reporters quipped he must have been expensive. The extraordinary speech, delivered in an oratory style variously compared to Brian Blessed, Tom Baker and Terry Wogan, left few in doubt about how Cox had convinced many an Old Bailey jury. Cox came to prominence after an impromptu strident defence of the prime minister Chequers plan to journalists waiting in a sweaty corridor outside the committee of backbenchers, in the hours following Boris Johnson resignation. Within hours, he had been promoted to the cabinet. In the speech on Wednesday, his first in a conference hall, he again extolled the virtues of Brexit as a route to sovereignty, leaning forward over the podium and delivering Milton with a flourish. “Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks,” he roared. “Methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam.” The delivery made such an impression, the prime minister ad-libbed a reference to her colleague in her own speech, quipping that should she lose her voice like last year, “I could just ask to borrow the voice of Geoffrey Cox.”",258,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/attorney-generals-speech-delights-tory-conference-delegates
9,"Theresa May used the beginning of her conference speech to make light of the laughter her dancing antics caused when she visited South Africa and Kenya in August. She entered the stage for her keynote speech at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham while swaying along to Abba Dancing Queen. Britain not afraid to leave EU with no deal, May tells Tory conference – Politics live The moves, which drew laughter from the audience in the hall, and more than a little mockery on social media, were combined with some opening references to the disastrous time she had delivering her conference speech last year. She apologised in advance if she coughed throughout this speech, saying she had been up all night superglueing the backdrop together – a reference to a sign that fell down behind her at conference last year. May dance moves were described on Twitter as “ classy ” by the Tory deputy chairman, James Cleverly, and as “ totally brill ” by the MP Michael Fabricant. Diane Abbott, who was mentioned in May speech as the prime minister addressed the issue of the level of abuse that MPs and their families received, was not so impressed . “Whoever thought that was a good idea should be sacked. I am looking at you Robbie Gibb,” in a reference to the Downing Street director of communications. In a week when May has received some tough messages from the EU over Brexit, her dancing at least seemed to win over one EU dignitary, as the Swedish ambassador to the UK offered her a bravo for her efforts. Observers on social media noted that May moves were a little robotic, which may not have been the intended impression. There were also concerns about the long-term effects for people listening to the Abba classic. Björn Ulvaeus: 'Abba was such a European idea' The Labour MP Angela Rayner described the dance with the hashtag #cringe. And the SNP MP Joanna Cherry said it was “an affront to my favourite song”. May referenced her dancing again later in the speech, jokingly suggesting that some of the young people she met on her visit to South Africa might have been inspired to become “professional dancers” among other things. And it is not the first time she has been associated with the Swedish group classic – Dancing Queen was one of the songs May chose when she appeared on Desert Island Discs in Still, with Boris Johnson leadership ambitions in mind, Dancing Queen was probably a better choice of song for May than some other Abba hits – she carefully avoided giving the impression that she was facing her Waterloo, or sending out an SOS.",449,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/dancing-queen-theresa-may-steps-out-again
10,"Boris Johnson was re-employed by the Daily Telegraph on a salary of a year for his weekly column, it has been revealed. The Conservative MP and potential leadership candidate had to give up his newspaper job when he became foreign secretary in forfeiting the substantial second income. However, the parliamentary register of members’ interests shows he was immediately rehired on the same rate after resigning this summer, with no attempt made by the Daily Telegraph – which has experienced years of job cuts and falling profits – to push down his salary. The former foreign secretary said he spends hours a month writing his word column, equivalent to a pay rate of – or around a word. The Daily Telegraph has announced plans to put more of its content behind a paywall, with Johnson column only accessible to paid subscribers. However, the politician has repeatedly made the full version of his column – edited by Daily Telegraph staff – available for free on his personal Facebook page. Staff at the newspaper also noted that earlier this month he wrote a highly newsworthy piece criticising Theresa May chequers deal in the rival Mail on Sunday , only to file a piece for the following day Telegraph criticising the High Speed railway (£). Despite this Johnson column has regularly provided the Telegraph with a front page news story for its Monday edition with his thoughts on Brexit.

11,"The government growing concern at the challenge posed by Labour has been highlighted by Philip Hammond as the chancellor admitted that Jeremy Corbyn was asking questions the Conservatives needed to answer. Hammond joined other cabinet colleagues in warning that Labour policies would endanger the economy but said his own party needed to show itself “worthy of the privilege of governing post-Brexit Britain”. The chancellor said: “Let me be clear about one thing – while Labour answers will solve nothing, their questions deserve a response. And we must answer their challenges with our own Conservative solutions based on realism not populism, delivery not rhetoric.” Hammond made it clear his response to Labour involved more years of austerity to reduce the national debt, and he dropped a strong hint that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit would make this month budget a cautious affair . The chancellor said that as part of the preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a deal he would be maintaining “enough fiscal firepower to support our economy if that happens”. But Hammond insisted that a deal was still possible on the terms outlined by Theresa May in her Chequers plan , which would result in a boost to growth and a “deal dividend” that would allow him to cut taxes, support public services, reduce the budget deficit and invest in the country future. The chancellor said the Treasury austerity programme would come under attack from what he called “populists and demagogues” among Corbyn supporters but said his approach would retain the backing of the public. Hammond said Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, were offering “a discredited ideology that will never solve real-world problems” and accused Labour of being a backward looking party “intellectually unequipped to tackle the complex challenges of the century and totally unfit to govern the country”. McDonnell hit back after the speech and accused the Tories of lacking any fresh ideas. “The chancellor speech confirmed the bankrupt state of the Tory party, increasingly irrelevant and cut off from the real day-to-day life most people experience,” he said. “The Tories are bereft of any fresh ideas, forced to resort to a half-hearted filching of policies from others and desperately trying to revive long-outdated slogans. As the Tories sink into a pit of bitter infighting, we mustn’t allow them to take the country down with it.” Speaking at the Tory conference in Birmingham, Hammond also said the time was approaching when the government would need to tax internet companies such as Amazon and Google, saying: “The global internet giants must contribute fairly to funding our public services.” Conservative conference: Hammond pledges digital services tax on web giants - Politics live Hammond said the best way to tax international companies was through global agreements, but added: “The time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a digital services tax of its own.” Backing Theresa May Chequers plan for a comprehensive exit deal, Hammond said Europe would remain Britain largest trading partner and there was a need for friction-free access to the EU to continue. “That why I share the prime minister determination to get the Chequers plan agreed,” he said. Hammond sought to counter the view that Britain would be able to cope easily if it left the EU without a deal and had to trade under World Trade Organization rules. Whatever the outcome of Brexit , Hammond said, Europe “will remain firmly anchored just a few miles off the coast of Kent”. He added: “Europe remains by far our biggest market and after years of membership, Britain economy has shaped itself around that fact. Complex supply chains cross and re-cross out borders.” Hammond said businesses needed to have continued friction-free access to the EU market. “That is why I share the prime minister determination to get the Chequer plan agreed – a plan which delivers on the decision of the British people, avoids a hard border in Ireland, preserves our precious union and safeguards British jobs and British businesses.”",685,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/01/philip-hammond-vows-to-stick-with-austerity-in-conference-speech-amazon-google
12,"Theresa May will declare that the Conservatives can represent the “decent, moderate and patriotic” as she seeks to reassert her authority on Wednesday, a day after Boris Johnson made an overt pitch for the leadership of the party. The prime minister will try to set out her political values after a testing day in which she conceded that Johnson crowd-pleasing pitch to a capacity audience of had made her “cross” because of his rejection of her Brexit strategy. Delegates queued for up to four hours and Brexit-backing MPs turned out in force to hear the former foreign secretary call May Chequers deal an “outrage” in a speech that raised the pressure on May to show Conservatives that she has a compelling long-term vision. The prime minister will use her keynote speech in Birmingham to attack Jeremy Corbyn by arguing that “millions of people who have never supported our party” are appalled by what he “has done to Labour”. Is this Boris Johnson last hurrah? | Gaby Hinsliff Appealing for centre ground votes, May will add: “They want to support a party that is decent, moderate and patriotic. One that puts the national interest first, delivers on the issues they care about and is comfortable with modern Britain in all its diversity.” Drawing upon Corbyn “for the many, not the few” slogan, May will conclude by saying that the Conservatives should be: “A party not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best.” The prime minister will announce that fuel duty will be frozen for the ninth year in a row in the budget later this month at an estimated cost to the Treasury of after having considered letting the levy rise with inflation. “Money in the pockets of hardworking people from a Conservative government that is on their side,” May will say. May is under intense pressure to deliver a confident address after last year disaster, where she struggled to get through her speech because of a persistent cough and letters on the backdrop gradually began to fall off. Earlier, in his only appearance at party conference, Johnson had made a leadership pitch by spelling out his own domestic policy agenda in a speech in which he called for a return to optimism and said that the government should tackle the housing crisis. Johnson said: “If I have a function here today it is to try, with all humility, to put some lead in the collective pencil, to stop what seems to me to be a ridiculous seeping away of our self-belief, and to invite you to feel realistic and justified confidence in what we can do.” The MP urged the Tories to take the fight to Labour but said they would not succeed by imitating them or “by capering insincerely on Labour turf – we won’t get anywhere by metaphorically acquiring beards and string vests and allotments, but by systematically pointing out the damage they would do.” He added: “Surely to goodness we can take this Tony Benn tribute act and wallop it for six.” The former foreign secretary said that the housing crisis was a “massive opportunity” for the Tories even though it has worsened during the party eight years in power. “If we rise to the challenge, if we get it right, it is an open goal, because this is one of those critical issues where … the facts of life do always turn out to be Conservative.” At least fifteen hard Brexit MPs watched Johnson speech, with former ministers David Davis, Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith all watching from the front row, enough to make the approval of a final Brexit deal by parliament uncertain. Father Stanley and sister Rachel were also in the audience. Johnson repeated his criticisms of May proposals for a post-Brexit Britain, warning that “Chequers is a cheat” and would “escalate the sense of mistrust” people have about politicians. “If we get it wrong – if we bottle Brexit now – believe me, the people of this country will find it hard to forgive,” he said. “This is not pragmatic, it is not a compromise. It is dangerous and unstable – politically and economically,” Johnson told the ConservativeHome event. “This is not democracy. This is not what we voted for. This is an outrage. This is not taking back control: this is forfeiting control.” May said she did not watch the speech as it was delivered and said that she was “cross” with Johnson because “he wants to tear up our guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland” because of his refusal to support her Chequers plan, which she says would uphold the soft border in Ireland. Few believe that Johnson has sufficient support in parliament to unseat May when the Commons returns next week, but the prime minister performance on Wednesday will nevertheless be closely scrutinised. Former leader Smith succumbed in October although the Brexit negotiations are at such a delicate stage that a leadership challenge would represent a significant complication. The party leadership also went to considerable effort to dilute the impact of Johnson speech by unveiling its post-Brexit migration policy, starting with May advocating the plans in morning television interviews and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, giving further details of the tiered immigration system on the conference floor an hour before Johnson spoke. It requires Conservative MPs writing to Graham Brady, the chairman of the Committee, to trigger a confidence vote in the prime minister. But Brady told a fringe meeting that people should be cautious about believing what backbench Tories tell the media about what they have done. “There are instances where I will see a Conservative colleague on the television saying they have written a letter to me when they haven’t. I will see them on the television saying they had withdrawn the letter to me, when they haven’t sent it in the first place. You have to be careful what you believe,” Brady said.",1002,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/02/conservative-conference-boris-johnson-slams-chequers-outrage-in-direct-pitch-to-tory-members
13,"Making the radical mainstream Jeremy Corbyn set the radical policies announced in Liverpool in the past few days within a long-running wider narrative: that policies of the kind he and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have long espoused have become the new normal. They argue that the grim economic legacy of the great crash and its aftermath has led to a widespread perception that the current system isn’t working. And it time to shake things up. “People in this country know that the old way of running things isn’t working any more,” he said. “And unless we offer radical solutions, others will fill the gap with the politics of blame and division. That why Labour speaks for the new majority.” Welcome to Labour conference where deep state paranoia and Momentum robots run amok | Marina Hyde Corbyn confidence is backed up by polling and focus groups that suggest ideas such as nationalisation, which until recently was anathema to most mainstream politicians, are now regarded by many voters as a pragmatic response to a system that isn’t working. He argued that the radical policies set out in the past few days in Liverpool – including a drastic extension of workers’ involvement at the top of companies – are the new centre ground. “Conference, we are winning the public debate. We have defined the new common sense, and that where our party can stand united,” he told his party. Similarly, he referred to his and McDonnell policies – once exiled on the lefty fringes of Labour – as “the new political mainstream”. HS Edging towards a position on Brexit Labour has been walking an almost impossible tightrope in Liverpool, trying to satisfy the ardent demands of many grassroots members that their party do more to try to stop Brexit, without alienating leave voters. Corbyn praised the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, for negotiating his way through the morass by agreeing a consensus position. And he gave a nod to both camps, saying “all options are on the table”, if May deal falls; but if she shifted her own position, Labour could back her. Corbyn also reprised of some of his better recent PMQs performances on Brexit, mocking the government disarray. “The main negotiations have taken place between the different factions of the Tory party and the only job this government is fighting for is the prime minister,” he said. There was also a loud pantomime “boo” in the crowd at the mention of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg. HS Drawing a line under anti semitism and Russia The Labour leader sought to move on from the controversies that have dogged him over the spring and summer – in particular the antisemitism row that at times saw him personally criticised. Corbyn conceded that the summer antisemitism crisis had been “tough” and had caused “immense hurt and anxiety in the Jewish community and great dismay in the Labour party”. Corbyn said that “the Jewish people have suffered a long and terrible history of persecution and genocide” and committed himself and the party to “work with Jewish communities to eradicate antisemitism, both from our party and wider society. And with your help I will fight for that with every breath I possess.” There was no personal apology from the party leader – as had been demanded by some in the Jewish community – for his own personal conduct, such as when he criticised a group of British Zionists for not displaying a sense of English irony . But he said he hoped his clear statement of principle would now “draw a line under the issue” and added: “Anti-racism is integral to our very being. It part of who you all are, and it part of who I am.” Corbyn took aim at the Conservatives on the issue of race, arguing that the party was guilty of double standards when it tried to criticise Labour on the issue. He also sought to deflect criticism of his initial questioning over whether the novichok poisonings in Salisbury were the work of the Russian state. The leader told conference that he now accepted they were, and praised the efforts of investigators. DS Promises for young and old – but at what cost? Jeremy Corbyn pledged to maintain the triple-lock on the state pension, the winter fuel allowance and the free pensioner bus pass as a way to say thank you to an older generation that helped build Britain. Corbyn uses conference speech to tell May he would back Brexit deal on Labour terms – Politics live The triple-lock is a costly measure that the Tories have pledged to retain until the end of the current parliament in It means the government will raise the basic state pension by average earnings, inflation or whichever is higher, in each of the next four years. How much more it will cost the exchequer in subsequent years will depend on inflation. If prices streak ahead of wages, which they have done in most years since the financial crash, it becomes a bigger cost for the Treasury without the compensation of higher tax receipts. At a cost of around each year, the state pension is the single biggest element of the welfare budget. A report last year calculated that the Treasury paid more in than if the state pension had tracked workers’ average earnings since when the triple-lock first took effect. Labour has also pledged to cover the childcare costs of all two-, three- and four-year-olds for up to hours a week. The subsidy will be available to all income groups, in contrast to the current means-tested scheme. It is an expensive plan that many experts believe will add considerably to the exchequer burden at a time when most public services are crying out for extra money. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has estimated that the extra annual running cost will be with capital costs of PI Green policies By putting renewable energy and efficiency at the heart of Labour offer, committing to ambitious emissions targets and clearly stating that climate change represents the biggest threat to humanity, Corbyn showed a possible pathway to a sustainable, low-carbon future. As always the devil will be in the detail. But the plans, which include a rollout of green technologies, including onshore and offshore wind turbines, solar panels on thousands of roofs and widescale home insulation, have been given a warm welcome by green groups. The commitment that of the UK heat and electricity will come from low-carbon or renewable sources by and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century are utterly necessary. Crucially Corbyn took these issues out of the environmental silo and put them at the heart of the party economic offer. And it may prove a smart electoral move. A big environmental push has the potential to unite two constituencies of Labour coalition that have been deeply divided over Brexit. For the towns and communities that have borne the brunt of deindustrialisation and insecure work, Corbyn green pitch offers the promise of hundreds of thousands of sustainable, high-skilled jobs. For Labour urban, liberal, middle class supporters it is a recognition that the environment is the key issue of our time. There were omissions: details on how these jobs will be created need to be fleshed out and there are structural forces wedded to the high carbon economy that will be resistant to change. But Corbyn appears to have listened to the overwhelming evidence on the environmental challenges facing the world and his speech opened up new political ground. The task now will be converting words into meaningful and urgent change. MT",1271,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/26/jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-speech-key-themes
14,"Philip Hammond is expected to warn his cabinet colleagues that a Canada-style trade deal of the kind championed by Brexiters would hit jobs, trade and growth, when he briefs ministers at Chequers on Friday. Theresa May is gathering her deeply divided cabinet at her country retreat to thrash out an agreed Brexit negotiating position – which will then be set out in a white paper next week. Senior Brexiters were already warning of the return of what they call “project fear” after Hammond revealed in the Commons that he would be giving a presentation on the economic implications of the options available. The chancellor told MPs on Tuesday: “I will be setting out for my colleagues in the privacy of our cabinet meeting on Friday the Treasury, indeed cross-Whitehall, economics group assessment of the implications of different potential routes forward.” Balancing act May must perform to create a clear Brexit plan However, one senior government Brexiter hit back: “It clear that the meeting will be a total stitch-up with No and Cabinet Office combining to try and bounce Brexit ministers with more failed predictions from project fear and rejected customs plans.” Pro-Brexit MPs in the backbench European Research Group have demanded a meeting with May chief whip, Julian Smith, on Wednesday morning, to remind him of their objections to the customs partnership. The ERG chair, Jacob Rees-Mogg, hinted earlier this week that he and his allies could vote against the government if May seeks to pursue a soft Brexit - even at risk of forcing her out of power. Hammond briefing is expected to be similar to the cross-Whitehall economic assessment leaked – and ultimately published – in March. That showed an EEA-style deal would knock to off GDP growth – while a free trade deal, such as the Canada-style agreement favoured by David Davis, would reduce it by to The chancellor is likely to be backed up by business secretary Greg Clark, one of the strongest advocates of frictionless trade. “It reassuring to know Philip Hammond has done his homework in advance of the Chequers peace summit,” said Labour shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook. “However, it will ultimately be parliament, not the cabinet, that will sign off on the final deal.” Leavers are bracing themselves for May, and her chief Brexit negotiator Ollie Robbins, to present them with plans for a significantly softer Brexit than she has previously signalled – including alignment with European Union regulations for the goods sector, to prevent friction at borders. May is also expected to revive some aspects of her “new customs partnership”, under which the government would impose EU import tariffs – and then refund the difference, if Britain chooses to cut its own duties. Brexiters regard the customs plan as too bureaucratic – and fear that it would make it unlikely tariffs would ever be cut. They have repeatedly insisted the plan is a “dead parrot”. Environment secretary Michael Gove ripped up one page of it in exasperation at a recent meeting. May is urging EU leaders to show flexibility in considering her plan when it is published. She travelled to The Hague on Tuesday, to discuss the issue with Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte. A Downing Street spokesperson said the pair had “discussed the importance of ensuring that trade between the Netherlands and the UK remained as frictionless as possible following the UK exit from the EU”. May will also meet with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, before the Chequers meeting. Meanwhile, businesses have delivered a fresh warning about the Brexiters’ favoured “max fac” customs plan, which uses technology such as numberplate recognition to minimise trade frictions. The Institute of Directors said its members believed max fac was not practical. Stephen Martin, the IoD director general, said: “As the government discusses options for post-Brexit customs this week, they should take note of the strong preference among business leaders for a solution which keeps trade friction to an absolute minimum. “Pursuing an option that relies on facilitations and simplifications doesn’t seem to cut it for our members. In short, ‘max fac’ is not the favoured route for keeping trade in full flow.” Martin added that Britain firms “want to see the prime minister leading her cabinet out at the end of this week with an agreed position, and then pushing on with negotiations with the EU”. Separately, a group of Britain leading professional and business services firms wrote to May on Tuesday with a list of requirements they say are essential to preserve the industry with its jobs and “keep the wheels of the British economy turning”. Loud and proud Philip Hammond comes clean on Brexit | John Crace The signatories from the Professional and Business Services Council (PBSC) – which represents law, accountancy, architecture, surveying and advertising firms – said they needed a number of assurances, including that they will still be able to recruit the best talent from overseas. “The UK needs to get the right deal on professional and other services given our relative strengths and current competitive position,” they wrote.

15,"Hugh Gaitskell death is a personal, political, and national tragedy. He has died young, at a time when he had at least an even chance of being the next Prime Minister, and when he looked like gaining office after hard years in opposition. In Labour ranks he leaves a gap that cannot be filled quickly - though it must be filled - for he alone of its leaders was known, trusted, and respected far beyond the party. Nationally, the tragedy is that a man of immense courage and integrity has been taken away just when he was most likely to be needed. He would have been a better Prime Minister than Leader of the Opposition, because his talents were creative. Already, as Minister of Fuel and briefly as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he had shown his ability for organisation and administration. As Leader of the Opposition, he was more concerned with seeking constructive policies - looking towards the day when Labour would again be in office - than with negatively damning the Government. He was too fair-minded not to see the truth of a situation and he knew that the freedom of any Government is circumscribed by events, by its allies, and by its physical resources. He rarely, if ever, took unfair advantage of the licence that an Opposition can exploit. Personally, too, it could be said of him that in opposition he was too kind to some of his critics within the party. He never waged the kind of personal warfare that some of his closest colleagues waged against him. In office as Prime Minister he might have changed. His construction of a Cabinet would have been uninhibited: he saw little purpose in axing “shadows,” but he was determined that when it became the Government his party should give the country the strongest leadership that it could. Of his courage, the Bevanite and bomb controversies are ample evidence. To a youthful Chancellor, rapidly promoted over the heads of experienced seniors, the Bevanite campaign against him could have been unnerving. He stood his ground, and his firmness helped him to win the leadership of the party in Suez was a test from which he emerged well; but as a national leader he did not really stand out until the election. Then, in spite of one tactical error (the income tax promise), he showed the coolness and good sense that a Prime Minister must have. The loss of that election was a disappointment, though not unexpected; it was followed by the bitterest attacks upon him from within the party, ending with the defeat of his defence policy at the Scarborough conference in He replied with the famous “fight, fight, and fight again” - for which the Left has never forgiven him - and by the long struggle to lead Labour out of the unilateralist wilderness. His commitment to the Atlantic alliance was complete, though he sought constantly to find ways of promoting harmony between East and West. Disengagement in Europe, a lesser dependence by the West on nuclear weapons, and effective political control over the generals, were for years among the first priorities in his policy. Although he was not an early convert to the non-nuclear club, he was quick to see the danger of letting nuclear weapons spread. The coming of President Kennedy as effective leader of the Western alliance was a great satisfaction to him. The two men got on well together - better, one may surmise, than Mr Kennedy and Mr Macmillan do - and each found stimulus in the other brisk intellect. Latterly, Cuba and the Common Market had clouded their respect for each other, but this was a passing phase. As Prime Minister, Hugh Gaitskell would have enjoyed the best of relations with the White House. It should be said also that he was a friendly and unaffected person. He enjoyed the kind of peaceful and private family life that fortifies a man in public office. Whoever follows him as Labour leader will have to continue along the course he has set - a non-doctrinaire approach to economic and industrial policy, a firm commitment to collective defence and multilateral disarmament and a readiness to see gradual reform of the Labour Party structure from within. Any other course will reopen old wounds and drive away sympathetic voters.

16,"Theresa May has used her closing speech at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham to announce that she is getting rid of the cap on what councils can borrow to build homes. As the Press Association reports, she said the government will scrap the cap on the amount local authorities can borrow against their housing revenue account assets. Before the introduction of the cap under Margaret Thatcher, councils built around homes a year - but that figure has subsequently dipped as low as The amount of extra investment in housing could be around a year, but this is dependent on how many councils decide to borrow. May told the Tories: Solving the housing crisis is the biggest domestic policy challenge of our generation. We cannot make the case for capitalism if ordinary working people have no chance of owning capital. The Local Government Association described the move, which involves lifting a Labour policy, as “fantastic”. (See May told Tories that splits in the party could halt Brexit. Stressing her opposition to a second referendum, she warned: If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all. She claimed that Jeremy Corbyn Labour party had rejected the “common values” that used to be shared by both main parties. She told the Tories: What has befallen Labour is a national tragedy. Would Neil Kinnock, who stood up to the hard-left, have stood by while his own MPs faced deselection, and needed police protection at their party conference? Would Jim Callaghan, who served in the Royal Navy, have asked the Russian government to confirm the findings of our own intelligence agencies? Would Clement Attlee, Churchill trusted deputy during the second world war, have told British Jews they didn’t know the meaning of antisemitism? What has it come to when Jewish families today seriously discuss where they should go if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister? When a leading Labour MP says his party is ‘institutionally racist’? When the leader of the Labour party is happy to appear on Iranian state TV, but attacks our free media here in Britain? That is what Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour party. Here is our main story on the speech. Theresa May lambasts Labour as she calls for Tory unity And here are verdicts on the speech from a Guardian panel: Matthew d’Ancona, Katy Balls, Dawn Foster and David Shariatmadari. Theresa May conference speech: what the verdict? | Matthew d’Ancona and others That all from me for the day. Thanks for the comments. Updated at BST Ian Blackford , the SNP leader at Westminster, said Theresa May was being “blind” to reality if she thought the UK best days lie ahead. In a statement he said: The prime minister danced around the key issues – the disastrous impact of Tory austerity and a Tory hard Brexit . There is a massive gulf between her rhetoric and the reality of what is now facing the UK. If Theresa May genuinely believes that the UK best days lie ahead then she is being wilfully blind to that reality. We are just months away from a potentially disastrous hard Brexit – or the utter catastrophe of a no-deal outcome. The SNP Scottish government has listened to the concerns raised by businesses, and repeatedly set out a compromise position – remaining in the single market – that will protect jobs, business, including our fishing industry, and the economy as a whole. In contrast, the prime minister has pandered to her party Brexit extremists, and treated the devolved administrations and the business community with contempt. No one seriously believes the UK best days lie ahead under this disastrous, bungling Tory government – and the sooner Mrs May realises that and commits to averting a hard Brexit the better. Lifting cap on borrowing for councils to build homes is says Local Government Association The Local Government Association says the decision to lift the borrowing cap for councils that are building houses is “fantastic”. This is from its chairman, Lord Porter . (Porter is a Conservative, but in his LGA capacity he frequently criticises the government over local authority funding.) He said: Today speech by the prime minister shows that the government has heard our argument that councils must be part of the solution to our chronic housing shortage. It is fantastic that the government has accepted our long-standing call to scrap the housing borrowing cap. We look forward to working with councils and the government to build those good quality affordable new homes and infrastructure that everyone in our communities need. Our national housing shortage is one of the most pressing issues we face and it is clear that only an increase of all types of housing – including those for affordable or social rent – will solve the housing crisis. The last time this country built homes at the scale that we need now was in the when councils built more than per cent of them. Councils were trusted to get on and build homes that their communities needed, and they delivered, and it is great that they are being given the chance to do so again. Other housing bodies that have welcomed the announcement include the Chartered Institute of Housing , which said it was “excellent news”, and the Royal Institute of British Architects , which said it was “delighted”. And here is Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, on the speech. As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby. But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her. She said the Conservatives must be a ‘party for the whole country’, yet she has overseen widening divisions in our society. Trapped by the rabid ideologues of the Conservative right-wing, Mrs May has been driven to illiberal extremes on Brexit, welfare and immigration, to name but three. We are pleased to see her finally lift the borrowing cap on councils so they can build houses, a policy I and my Liberal Democrat colleagues have pushed for in coalition. The Conservatives’ long-held resistance to this sensible, pragmatic policy has only deepened the housing crisis. Ed Conway, Sky economics editor, says the markets did not react much to Theresa May speech. But the Telegraph Christopher Hope thinks May went on a spending spree. And here is the main Labour party response to the speech. It a statement by Ian Lavery, the party chair. He said: While the country is crying out for real change, all Theresa May and her party offer are pinched ideas and tinkering around at the edges, relying on petty attacks to cover up their lack of vision. Austerity is not an economic necessity. It is a political choice made by the Conservatives to hack away at our public services and communities, leaving workers worse off while gifting huge tax cuts to big business. And as long as Britain has a Conservative prime minister, we’ll never see an end to austerity. Theresa May has shown her party offers no answers, no ideas, and no hope for communities held back for too long. Labour has put forward a radical and credible plan to transform our economy, public services and towns and cities. A plan to rebuild Britain for the many, not the few. Labour says claim austerity is over is John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that Theresa May claim that austerity is ending is “a complete con”. speech - View from Brussels Daniel Boffey A distinct lack of bombastic rhetoric on Brexit in Theresa May speech was welcomed in Brussels. But her strident rejection of the EU suggestion that Northern Ireland should in effect stay in the customs union to avoid a hard border disappointed the more optimistic diplomats in the Belgian capital. There just doesn’t seem to be any fudge open on the issue of avoiding a hard border. Some EU diplomats had perhaps naively hoped there might be a little movement on the issue. Some engagement with the notion that keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs area isn’t all that dramatic. A “rational discussion”, one called it. But the prime minister framed the issue as a constitutional one again. With just over two weeks to go until the “moment of truth” EU leaders summit, May said in her speech there were “better days ahead”. Not imminently, by all accounts. “Popcorn time”, added one cynical eurocrat. Heather Stewart With Boris Johnson rally the biggest draw on the fringe, MPs were keen to see if Theresa May would deliver a direct riposte to the former foreign secretary claim that her Chequers plan was a “betrayal”. But she did not mention him by name, simply saying: We have had disagreements in this party about Britain membership of the EU for a long time. So, it is no surprise that we have had a range of different views expressed this week. But my job as prime minister is to do what I believe to be in the national interest. She also made an oblique reference to Johnson recent “fuck business’ comment. She said: To all businesses – large and small – you may have heard that there is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you. It has a single syllable. It is of Anglo-Saxon derivation. It ends in the letter ‘K’. Back business. Here is Rupert Harrison, who was chief of staff for George Osborne when Osborne was chancellor, on the decision to lift the cap on what councils can borrow to build houses. speech - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the speech.

17,"Five Conservatives have said they have submitted letters of no confidence in the prime minister, and many more may have done so privately – but what would be needed to actually trigger a contest? It would take Conservative MPs to back a no-confidence vote in Theresa May to trigger a leadership contest, according to party rules. A contest can be triggered in two ways, the first if the leader of the party resigns. If they do not but MPs are unhappy with their leader, of Conservative MPs must write to the chairman of the Committee of backbench Tories. With the party MPs, would be needed. No one knows how many letters have been sent, apart from the chair of the Committee, Sir Graham Brady. An hour before the prime minister speech at the party conference in Birmingham on Wednesday, the Tory MP James Duddridge told Sky News he had written a letter of no confidence. “I have not met a single MP who thinks she will lead us into another election after the last disastrous snap election,” he wrote in the letter. “I write this with heavy heart; however, we now need a proper leadership election and to move on.” Duddridge is the fifth MP to publicly say he has written a letter of no confidence, along with Philip Davies, Andrea Jenkyns Andrew Bridgen and Nadine Dorries, all staunch Brexiters. Another MP, Simon Clarke, has said publicly that he sent a letter but then asked it to be withdrawn. It has been reported that between and letters have been sent privately. However, Brady hinted in a conference fringe meeting on Tuesday that the numbers might not be as high as some of May more vocal critics believed. “The distance between what some of my colleagues say they might have done and what they actually have done can be considerable,” the Tory veteran said. “There are instances where I will see a Conservative colleague on the television saying they have written a letter to me when they haven’t. I will see them on the television saying they had withdrawn the letter to me, when they haven’t sent it in the first place. You have to be careful what you believe.” Brady said he counts all the letters that had been sent since the beginning of the parliament, but should the threshold be reached he would double-check with MPs who had sent their letter some time ago in case they had changed their minds. Tory leadership rules do not permit a challenge by a rival, so Boris Johnson or another candidate could not directly challenge Theresa May. Instead, when the number of no confidence letters is reached, Brady would announce a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, and a simple majority of MPs would oust a party leader, though the leader would also be likely to resign if they received a significant number of no-confidence votes. Tory leadership races give MPs the power to whittle down the shortlist to the final two. After David Cameron resigned, five MPs stood for the leadership and were reduced to May and Andrea Leadsom. However, in Leadsom withdrew from the race after a damaging interview with the Times about the fact that May did not have children. Her withdrawal meant May was made party leader without having been elected by members.",557,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/three-tory-mps-say-they-have-sent-letters-of-no-confidence-in-theresa-may
18,"The London assembly member Shaun Bailey will be the Conservative candidate to take on Sadiq Khan for mayor of London in winning the nomination in the runoff on Friday. Bailey beat fellow assembly member Andrew Boff and businesswoman Joy Morrissey after a vote by London Tory members. Bailey, a former special adviser to David Cameron, called the nomination “a great honour” and said he would hold Khan to account. “For someone who grew up in a council house in one of the poorest parts of London, securing this nomination is proof that our city truly is the place where anything is possible,” he said. 'May totally betrayed us': Tory grassroots' Brexit tension boils over “It why I’ve spent my entire adult life trying to repay its generosity, either through my years of youth work helping to steer children away from a life of crime and towards work opportunities, or my current involvement on the London assembly, where I have done my best to hold the current mayor to account.” Bailey, said he would focus his campaign on violent crime and the transport budget, as well as housing. “After two and a half years of Sadiq Khan, it is clear we cannot afford more of the same,” he said. “I look forward to meeting with Londoners in every borough and continuing the conversation about how we can do better to make sure London works for everyone.” The Conservative party chairman, Brandon Lewis, said Bailey was “passionate about London and has the ideas London needs to continue to be the best capital city in the world”. He added: “London is being let down by Sadiq Khan, who keeps breaking the promises he made to Londoners on crime, housing and transport. I know Shaun will hold him to account and outline his positive vision for London.” Bailey was endorsed by the London Evening Standard, which is edited by the Conservative former chancellor George Osborne, and was considered a frontrunner for the nomination. He was a youth worker who became an adviser to Cameron on young people and crime before being elected to the London assembly. Bailey was selected as a candidate in the election in the safe Labour seat of Lewisham West, where he lost to Ellie Reeves. Bailey received of the vote in first round of voting, Boff received and Morrissey won Bailey defeated Boff in the runoff of second preferences, the party said. Boff was the only candidate of the three who publicly disavowed the campaign by former candidate Zac Goldsmith, which was criticised for associating Khan with alleged extremists before he became an MP. The Muslim Council of Britain wrote to all three candidates last month “to ask for your views on Mr Goldsmith strategic campaign to focus on Sadiq Khan faith and background in an effort to win the election”. The MCB said it was “deeply disappointing” that Bailey and Morrissey did not publicly distance themselves. Marsha de Cordova, the Labour MP for Battersea, said Bailey had helped implement cuts to the Metropolitan police and millions more from London youth services during his time in Downing Street.",518,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/28/shaun-bailey-is-tory-candidate-for-mayor-of-london
19,"The Tories' failure to win an overall majority was partly down to their performance in London – where a number of the party high-profile candidates did not make the breakthrough expected in target seats. Joanne Cash reacted to her shock failure to win Westminster North, where she required a swing of just after boundary changes from by launching a tirade on the media. Even the Labour incumbent Karen Buck had admitted before the count that she was expecting to lose. Cash, who is married to one of the Tory leader Eton contemporaries, Octavius Black, blamed media ""lies"" for her defeat. ""The Westminster North media played an incredibly powerful role, and we have to face the question about what their role will be going forward,"" she said. ""Are they going to tell the truth or are they going to trash people, lie about their families?"" Other high-profile Conservative candidates also failed to make the inroads that would have helped the party to make a comprehensive breakthrough on a national level. Shaun Bailey profile as a young, black youth worker saw him appear at a number of Conservative events as part of David Cameron efforts to show that the Tories had changed to a more inclusive, tolerant party. But he only made a slight dent in Labour majority in the new seat of Hammersmith as Andy Slaughter won by votes. Philippa Stroud, who was the subject of an Observer exposé last weekend showing that she ran prayer sessions to ""cure"" gay people , was another Tory rising star who failed to get elected. Stroud, who has been credited with shaping many of the party social policies as head of the Centre for Social Justice thinktank, failed to get the swing she needed to win Sutton and Cheam from the Lib Dems' Paul Burstow. There was better news for the Conservatives in Richmond Park where multimillionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith overturned Lib Dem Susan Kramer majority . The ""celebrity Tory"" had poured money and resources into the seat, and it paid off as he emerged with a majority. The Tories also won Ealing Central and Battersea, both of which Labour had won with tiny majorities in Harrow East, Hendon and Brentford and Isleworth. The Conservatives held Croydon Central, where Labour required just a swing, despite the Tory candidate at the last election, Andrew Pelling, standing as an independent . Pelling had the Conservative whip withdrawn in September after being arrested on suspicion of assaulting his wife. No charges were ever brought. Despite the Tory gains, the electoral map in London still looks a lot less blue than when the Conservatives were last in government, as Labour losses in the capital were not as bad as some had predicted. As well as Buck unexpected victory in Westminster North, Sadiq Khan held Tooting for Labour from the Conservatives and Glenda Jackson defeated the Tories in Hampstead and Kilburn by just votes, with the Lib Dems, who needed a swing of just to win the seat, pushed into third. Labour also comfortably saw off the challenge from the BNP in Barking and won back Bethnal Green and Bow from Respect. In Islington South and Finsbury, Emily Thornberry unexpectedly held her seat, where she increased her majority over the Lib Dems' Bridget Fox, whom she beat by just votes in Labour minister for London and London election campaign director, Tessa Jowell, said the party had ""exceeded expectations"". ""Just two days ago the Tories were predicting a landslide in London, winning seats like Hayes and Harlington,"" she said. ""The Tories will be bitterly disappointed not to have performed better in the capital. It is clear that Boris Johnson police cuts and hikes in bus fares were very unpopular with Londoners.'' The Lib Dems, who failed to make the gains they were predicting, could take some consolation from Sarah Teather winning Brent Central from Labour Dawn Butler, who had a notional majority of almost at the last election.",658,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/07/general-election-results-london
20,"David Cameron is under pressure to justify Zac Goldsmith London mayoral campaign, after the leader of Muslim Conservatives called it a disgusting and risible attempt to smear Labour winning candidate, Sadiq Khan. Mohammed Amin, the chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum, joined other senior Tory figures in condemning the attacks on Khan by Goldsmith. In an article for ConservativeHome , Amin objected to Goldsmith efforts to paint Khan as a “closet extremist” and said the attempts to smear him had “probably increased our risks of suffering terrorism”. Michael Fallon declines to confirm London is ‘safe’ under Sadiq Khan “Isis [Islamic State] are perpetually seeking to radicalise and recruit young British Muslims to their cause. At the margin, I believe there is a risk that young impressionable British Muslims who witnessed Khan being smeared in this manner will thereby be made more vulnerable to radicalisation”. Amin said he voted for Goldsmith by post a week before polling day because he disliked Khan transport policies, but he could not bring himself to campaign for the Tory candidate. “I was disgusted (I considered milder words, but decided to be frank) with the tone of his campaign and his repeated and risible attempts to smear Sadiq Khan ,” he wrote. “My wife, who has been a Conservative party member for about years and attends each party conference with me, was if anything even more outraged. She could not bring herself to vote for Zac at all, and exercised her democratic right to vote for Khan. She did, however, vote Conservative for the Greater London assembly.” Labour had repeatedly claimed the attacks on Khan were dog-whistle racism aimed at suggesting London was not safe in the hands of a Muslim mayor. Cameron himself joined in with Goldsmith attempts to link Khan to alleged Islamist extremists with whom he had shared a platform while working as a human rights lawyer. The politics of fear and division isn't dead quite yet in Sadiq Khan London Many Conservatives kept quiet about their concerns until after the polls closed but, as it became clear Khan was going to win by a landslide, a string of senior figures spoke out. Sayeeda Warsi, the former Tory co-chairman, said it was “appalling”, while Andrew Boff, the leader of the Conservatives in the London assembly, and Roger Evans, the deputy mayor to the outgoing Boris Johnson, raised concerns it could set back community relations in London. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, said it was now clear the campaign was a mistake. Michael Fallon, the Tory defence secretary, defended Goldsmith campaign on Saturday morning, saying it was part of the “rough and tumble” of politics. However, that is unlikely to be enough to insulate Cameron from questions about why he and Goldsmith were drawn into a campaign to paint Khan as a security risk. Speaking on the Today programme, Fallon pointedly refused to say London would be safe in the hands of Khan, simply stressing that it would be fine being run by a Conservative government alongside a Labour mayor. Sadiq Khan victory won’t end Islamophobia, but it offers hope | Homa Khaleeli Concerns about whether Goldsmith campaign was attempting to divide communities first arose over leaflets targeting Hindu voters suggesting that Khan would tax jewellery. As it progressed, Goldsmith repeatedly questioned Khan judgment in associating with alleged extremists before he became an MP. He was particularly criticised for an article in the Mail on Sunday illustrated with a picture from the July bombings and headlined: “Are we really going to hand the world greatest city to a Labour party that thinks terrorists are its friends?” The tactics appeared to backfire when the prime minister linked Khan to a Muslim man called Suliman Gani , claiming he supported Islamic State. Gani turned out to be a Conservative supporter who had shared platforms with leading Tories as well, and who has threatened to sue anyone repeating the claims outside the House of Commons. He is on record as supporting an Islamic state, not the terrorist group of that name. After Fallon repeated Cameron claims on Radio Gani tweeted on Saturday : “I am seeking legal action against the defence secretary and would like a public retraction of his comments.”",705,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/top-conservatives-condemn-zac-goldsmiths-disgusting-mayoral-campaign
21,"The Conservative candidate for London mayor, Zac Goldsmith , has been accused of a smear campaign against his Labour rival specifically targeted at minority ethnic voters warning them a vote for Sadiq Khan would put their family heirlooms at risk. Leaflets sent out in Goldsmith name appeared to warn Indian voters in the city that a vote for Khan could put their family jewellery at risk. It said Goldsmith would stand up for the British Indian community by getting police to focus on protecting family homes from burglary, whereas Khan party supported “a wealth tax on family jewellery”. The leaflet, which the Guardian has seen, also said that Khan, the Labour candidate and current MP for Tooting, posed a risk for London future because he had not attended the UK welcome rally for Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, at Wembley stadium last year. A spokesman for Goldsmith said he could not comment on campaign tactics but confirmed the leaflets had been approved. He added: “Khan experimented with Corbyn and helped elect a Labour leadership who want a new tax on family heirlooms, including jewellery – if he is allowed to experiment with London from City Hall he represents a threat to the economic security of every family in our city.” Gita Malhotra, a Londoner who lives in Newham, told the Guardian she was offended by the letter she had received from the Goldsmith campaign. “I got a letter in the post yesterday and it was clearly targeted and directly addressed to me,” she said. “I’m a British Indian but I had a visceral reaction to this. I’m a Londoner, I’m and this seemed divisive,” she said, adding: “It seemed as though he picked the brains of an adviser and has played on the anxieties of the south Asian community.” She added the campaign literature “made assumptions on what British Indians cared about”. Goldsmith has a strong relationship with Kingston Muslim Association in his constituency and has held surgeries for constituents at the local mosque. Hashim Bhatti, a Tory councillor and Conservative Muslim Forum Member, told the Guardian: “I haven’t seen the literature at all but I firmly believe Londoners will pull together and vote for a new mayor based on their policies and merit but also in their ability to continue to make London a great city.” In another case of the Goldsmith campaign targeting minority ethnic communities first reported on politics.co.uk , the Goldsmith campaign sent a letter to British Tamils living in London, also suggesting a vote for the Labour candidate could lead to a new “wealth tax on family jewellery”. “As a government minister, Sadiq Khan did not use his position to speak about Sri Lanka or the concerns of the Tamil community in parliament. His party are beginning to adopt policies that will mean higher taxes on your family and your family heirlooms and belongings,” the leaflet states. Uma Kumaran, a Labour party adviser who is Tamil, said the leaflets were “downright patronising”. The Daily Sikh , a popular Sikh website, wrote that the campaign targeted at minority ethnic voters was a “disastrous move” by Goldsmith team. The op-ed went on to say: “In what can only be described as an ill-informed and arrogant mailshot, Goldsmith team targeted the postal addresses of tens of thousands of Londoners of ‘Indian’ origin. “For some bizarre reason, Goldsmith assumed all the Sikhs were middle-class Hindus, running family businesses, concerned about burglaries and possessions whilst welcoming Modi UK visit last year.” Previously, the word “radical” had been used to describe Khan policies in Goldsmith leaflets, which Khan objected to , saying the use of such language about a Muslim candidate was playing with fire. The Muslim Council of Britain would not comment on the campaign but said: “When British Muslims take part in politics and in the democratic life of our country, they deserve to be treated fairly and not be subject to smears that they are somehow closet extremists … Sadiq Khan deserves to be scrutinised on his record and policies, not smears by insinuation.”",677,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/16/zac-goldsmith-leaflet-british-indians-heirlooms
22,"The Labour MP Emma Dent Coad has apologised for referring to a Conservative London assembly member as a “token ghetto boy” in a blogpost written before she was elected, after two Tory MPs called for the whip to be removed. Shaun Bailey , who was then Hammersmith Conservative parliamentary candidate, said the MP had written “racist, hate-filled remarks”. After the comments were unearthed by the Guido Fawkes blog , James Cleverly and Kemi Badenoch wrote an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn, calling on the Labour leader to suspend the whip from the Kensington MP and investigate the comments. In a piece on her blog from Dent Coad said Bailey had “stigmatised” the area he was born in by referring to it as a “ghetto”. “Who can say where this man will ever fit in, however hard he tries? One day he is the ‘token ghetto boy’ standing behind D Cameron, the next ‘looking interested’ beside G Osborne,” she wrote. “Ever felt used?” The MP said she had been repeating descriptions made by others, something Bailey later denied, and her comments had been taken “the wrong way”. “If he was offended by me repeating what other people have said then I do apologise,” she told BBC Radio London. “Clearly, I shouldn’t have repeated it. People have taken it the wrong way.” Bailey denied saying the words and said he would not have used language such as ghetto to describe where he grew up. He called the apology cowardly and said he had written to Corbyn asking him to take disciplinary action against the MP. “I’m extremely disappointed and further saddened by the cowardly response given by Emma Dent Coad,” he said in a statement. “Instead of facing this issue, she has attempted to blur and camouflage the views she expressed in her blog by falsely dressing them up as someone else words. “Despite her claims, she can provide no evidence that I or anyone else used the horrendous terms she advocated. I find it appalling that someone as privileged as Ms Dent Coad would dare question the legitimacy of my background. I am now urging Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party to take the strongest disciplinary action possible.” In a Twitter thread , Badenoch said she was concerned about the implications of Dent Coad comments, calling them “profoundly distressing, and a toxic reminder of the struggle black people face daily in defeating stereotypes”. “I’m a black Conservative. I don’t think every offensive comment is racism, but when I see real prejudice I have to call it out,” she wrote. Badenoch said the comments showed “an assumption that there only one way to be black, and anyone who doesn’t conform is a ‘coconut’, an ‘Uncle Tom’ or a race traitor”. The MP for Saffron Waldon said she had heard one black boy at a school accusing his classmate of “acting white” because he liked reading. “It is a poisonous belief and destroys the lives of so many children,” she tweeted. “Where do such attitudes come from? From ‘community leaders’ like Ms Dent-Coad, who want to tell us what to think and how to behave. “They haven’t given us permission to leave our ghettoes, be Conservative or make friends with posh white people. This was Shaun crime.

Shaun Bailey lost his job as a special adviser earlier this year and was moved to a part-time role in the Cabinet Office, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph . Bailey felt he was excluded by Cameron advisers because he was ""different"" and asked demanding questions about what the government was doing. After four months of being excluded by Cameron other advisers he was moved to what he saw as a ""non-job"" in the Cabinet Office. On Saturday Bailey tweeted that he did not criticise the prime minister for the way he was treated: "" Regarding the Telegraph article I want to be clear I have no problem with the PM. He has always supported me."" Bailey told his friends that the PM advisers had no interest in concerns about the cost of living or diversity and were heavily conditioned by a public school mindset. Cameron has been accused of running an old boys' network at No after he recently promoted several Old Etonians including Jo Johnson, the brother of the London mayor Boris Johnson, and Jesse Norman. The prime minister was also educated at Eton, as was Ed Llewellyn, his chief of staff, Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, and Sir George Young, the chief whip. Bailey was paid a salary of to advise the prime minister on youth, crime and race after the general election but in January he was moved to the Cabinet Office, and renamed ""youth and engagement champion"" with a one-year contract and salary.

Asked to respond to Hunt remarks, the European commission chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said: “I would say respectfully that we would all benefit – and in particular foreign affairs ministers – from opening a history book from time to time.” Two former leaders of the Foreign Office and a former president of Estonia were among those who condemned the speech, in which Hunt described the EU as a prison. Conservative conference: Hammond says Johnson will never be PM - Politics live Peter Ricketts, who ran the Foreign Office in and is a former ambassador to France, tweeted: “This rubbish is unworthy of a British foreign secretary. The EU isn’t a Soviet-style prison. Its legal order has brought peace and prosperity after a century of war. Our decision to leave was always going to leave us worse off. The only punishment is the self-inflicted variety.” Sir Simon Fraser, who led the Foreign Office in said he agreed with Lord Ricketts . “Whatever you think about Brexit, shocking failure of judgment for British foreign secretary to compare European Union with Soviet Union,” he wrote on Twitter. Back in Birmingham, senior government figures expressed concern about Hunt remarks, which were widely regarded as a pitch to grassroots Conservative members. With talks at a delicate stage, there were concerns that the foreign secretary robust tone could jeopardise Britain relationship with its negotiating partners. The European parliament Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said Hunt remarks were “offensive and outrageous”. Former Conservative prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher “those great defenders of European freedom and democracy, must be turning in their graves”, Verhofstadt wrote. The comparison would have been shocking for many EU member states that were once occupied by the Soviet Union or controlled from Moscow. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council and a former Polish prime minister, was a student supporter of Poland anti-communist Solidarity trade union. He lost his job and was evicted from his home when Poland rulers cracked down on opponents in and was later jailed for founding a periodical about liberal economics.

Radosław Sikorski, foreign minister in Tusk government, demanded an apology from Hunt, describing comparisons of the European Union to the USSR as “cheap and offensive, particularly to us who have lived in both”. On Twitter he wrote: “Did the Red Army force you to join? How many millions has Brussels exterminated? Gulag for demanding a referendum on independence? Apologise, Jeremy Hunt!” Latvia ambassador to London, Baiba Braže, tweeted : “Soviets killed, deported, exiled and imprisoned [hundreds of] thousands of Latvia inhabitants after the illegal occupation in and ruined lives of generations, while the EU has brought prosperity, equality, growth, respect.” To dispel the impression of a break in relations, Braže later added she was grateful for Hunt “warm words and memories” of his visit to Latvia and “the UK contribution to our freedom”. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, Estonia former president, criticised Hunt words in a series of withering tweets . “I used to think foreign ministers were the smartest people in democratic governments,” he wrote. However, while serving as Estonia foreign minister “I realised then that most of my colleagues from parliamentary democracies were either the head of the junior coalition partner (with little interest in foreign policy) or a crony/competitor of the PM.” Hunt told party conference delegates he had voted to remain in the EU but now supported leave because of what he called the EU “arrogance” during Brexit negotiations. He said the EU seemed to want to “punish” a member for leaving , and likened its tactics to the Soviet Union. “The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish, it will grow – and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to escape,” he said. “If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister, you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom and more opportunities than ever in history.” He recalled a recent visit to Latvia, where he laid a wreath at the Latvian Freedom Monument. “In a remarkable transformation, Latvia is a modern democracy, part of both Nato and the EU. And no European country did more to bring about that transformation than Britain,” he said. Lithuania EU commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, also condemned the foreign secretary. “I was born in Soviet gulag and been imprisoned by KGB a few times in my life,” he wrote on Twitter. Andriukaitis, a medical doctor and historian, was one of the signatories of the Lithuanian declaration of independence in having been active in the anti-Soviet movement since his teens. His parents were deported to Siberia under Josef Stalin orders in and were only allowed to return separately in “Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and Soviet Union.

25,"Name: Operation Arse. Classification: Top secret. In that case, why are you telling me about it? All right. Bottom secret. That better. What is it? What what? The secret. Oh, that the Tories have a plan to stop Boris Johnson from becoming party leader. That a secret? The fact that they have a plan is. Or was. The Daily Record now reports that a group of Scottish Tories are coordinating a campaign to persuade their MPs to vote against Johnson in any forthcoming leadership contest. They also want to convince party members that he would be an electoral disaster. I thought Theresa May was already an electoral disaster? Yes. She is very unpopular with voters, it true. But, luckily for her, Jeremy Corbyn is even more unpopular, according to the polls . However, Johnson is so staggeringly unpopular that he might run Corbyn close if he took over. Just a thought: maybe the Tories could choose someone popular to lead them? Let not try to run before we can walk. The first thing is to stop the Johnson juggernaut. Hence: Operation Arse. “We called it that so we’d all be clear who we were talking about,” said a senior Tory. Cunning . So far at the party conference, Johnson has been called, among other things, an “irrelevance” and an “offensive person” (Digby Jones), a maker of “good headlines but not necessarily good policies” (David Davis) and “very unhelpful” (George Freeman). So why would such an unpopular person be a threat? Ah. Well it all depends who you are unpopular with. Just as Corbyn is very popular among Labour party members, but disliked more widely, Johnson is very popular with Conservative party members. Ah. And members ultimately choose the leader? That right. Some Tories worry about Johnson becoming the focus of a so-called “blue Momentum” , which could see thousands of new members join the party and push it further to the right. What on earth do people see in him? Some say he has star quality. Others call him a charlatan . He certainly has a talent for using blunt, straightforward language to paint dreamy pictures of the perfect Britain that would follow a kind of Brexit that he is persistently vague and indecisive about. So he sounds as though he tells it like it is, while telling it like it isn’t? Welcome to politics. Do say: “Surely no big western democracy would ever be foolish enough to elect a wild-haired conman on the strength of his false promises and bracing sense of humour?” Don’t say: “No. The chances must be one in a million.”",435,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/oct/02/operation-arse-secret-tory-plot-keep-boris-johnson-out
26,"The Democratic Unionist party has threatened to pull the plug on Theresa May government, warning it is not bluffing when it says it will not accept a border in the Irish Sea. Nigel Dodds, the leader of the DUP in the House of Commons, said the party would vote against May if she returned from Brussels with a deal that involved new checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Britain. “We will vote against it. We will vote for our red lines,” he told the Guardian. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster , had earlier said the party confidence and supply arrangement with the Conservatives was “party to party” and not with May herself, while the European commission accused Westminster decision-makers of being “completely irresponsible” over Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson gives long-awaited Tory conference speech to packed fringe meeting - Politics live Dodds said the DUP was not afraid to take action if the prime minister betrayed the party by going back on her promise that Northern Ireland would not be left with different trading and customs arrangements from Britain. “In Northern Ireland we’ve grown up with a lot of fears and issues that we’ve faced, frankly being afraid of what Theresa May may do is not one of my biggest fears,” he said. After a presentation at a fringe event at the Tory party conference in Birmingham, he made clear the party was not intending to abandon its confidence and supply agreement but that it would not prop up a prime minister that left Northern Ireland “semi-detached” from the UK. He said the party would not be fobbed off with guarantees in a political deal between the EU and the UK that would accompany any Brexit deal. “The deal on the future relationship will have to be crystal clear and not a fudge, we won’t settle for any vague outline of a future relationship in exchange for a backstop , that is simply not going to happen,” he said. His remarks will dash hopes that delicate ongoing talks over a compromise on the Irish border could be hammered out before the next EU summit later this month. Foster had earlier openly spoken about the possibility of working with Boris Johnson, in a clear signal to May that she could not take their support for granted. “Theresa May understands very well that we are not bluffing on this issue … there is far too much at stake for us as unionists, but also economically for Northern Ireland,” she told the Guardian. Foster and Dodds are due to meet May in a side meeting in Birmingham on Tuesday afternoon and will be repeating their message to her, they said. The Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said the threat to the confidence and supply agreement was a major development for May. “I suspect this is a far more significant development today than the latest Boris Johnson circus,” she tweeted. The EU has been hoping to break the deadlock on the Irish border by arguing checks on goods could be made on ships and at ports in Britain. Earlier the commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, condemned the attitude towards Northern Ireland in Westminster. “It is central to our responsibility to do as little harm as possible in these negotiations,” Timmermans said. “And to just brush it aside in London is completely irresponsible.” The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said: “When it comes to the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, we are sticking to the point of view that we have expressed so many times: Ireland first.” The UK and the commission have agreed that there needs to be a backstop solution to avoiding a hard border. It would kick in after Brexit and the transition period ending in December should a trade deal or technological solution not be in place by that point. May has said that no British prime minister could accept the commission proposal to allow Northern Ireland to maintain key benefits of EU membership by remaining in the bloc customs union and under single market legislation. She said Whitehall would instead put forward a new proposal under which the whole of the UK would remain temporarily in a customs arrangement. Stormont would also be asked if it wanted to stay under EU single market rules. Other key figures, including Johnson have claimed that the issue has been overblown. Speaking to MEPs in Strasbourg, Timmermans said he was astonished by the failure in the UK to see the importance of EU membership to keeping the peace in Northern Ireland. The former Dutch foreign minister told MEPs: “How is it possible that people coming from the UK maintain that there is no link between union and the Good Friday agreement. The European Union is an integral part of the success of the Good Friday agreement . “It would not have been possible without the European Union . The Good Friday agreement was one of the most historical achievements … We are all responsible for maintaining that legacy and preventing the island of Ireland from going to a past that I knew as a young man.”",856,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/02/brexit-eu-hits-out-irresponsible-uk-northern-ireland
27,"Why is a backstop necessary? Both the UK and the EU are determined to avoid a hard border – physical infrastructure, officials, checks – between Northern Ireland and the republic after Brexit. The government believes the key to doing this is a comprehensive free trade and customs agreement, but the EU fears Theresa May red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and ECJ jurisdiction make such a deal unlikely. It also thinks there is no time to conclude one (it could take many, many years) before the transition period ends in December The government has proposed two customs solutions: a partnership, under which Britain would collect import duties on the EU behalf, and a high-tech “max-fac” alternative, but the EU has rejected both as unworkable. So Brussels has insisted the UK sign up to a legally binding “backstop” clause, or fallback option, to ensure there is no hard border. What did Britain sign up to? Back in December, the UK agreed that in the absence of any other solution, Northern Ireland would remain in “full alignment” with the EU single market and customs union rules in all relevant sectors. But after the DUP intervention, it also guaranteed no border in the Irish Sea – sowing the seeds of its current dilemma. The legal text that followed, drawn up by the European commission, stipulated that until a workable solution was found, Northern Ireland would be part of a “common regulatory area ... and customs territory” with the EU to ensure free movement of goods across the Irish border. May dismissed this as unacceptable because it implied creating a customs and regulatory barrier between Northern Ireland and the UK and promised to publish a counter-proposition, which the government has now done. So what is the UK backstop proposal? In essence, the UK proposal is for the whole of the UK to remain in the customs union for a limited period after the end of the transition period – so it would leave the EU in March and the single market in December but stay in the customs union for longer. The idea is “to apply a temporary customs arrangement ... between the UK and the EU” that would allow the UK to sign free trade deals with other countries (but not implement the parts of them relating to tariffs, rendering them largely pointless). The proposed UK backstop “will only be in place until the future customs arrangement can be introduced”, which the government “expects” to be the end of December at the latest. So is this the answer? Hardly. First, there is no clarity on who calls time on the backstop and when. This is a problem: pro-Brexit ministers and MPs would like the UK to be able to declare it over unilaterally, so those trade deals can kick in. But the EU (including Ireland) did not agree in December, and is unlikely to agree now, to a time limit that could end with the Irish border problem still unresolved: a temporary backstop is not a backstop. The UK document is therefore a fudge: it tries to set a time limit without actually setting one. But the EU also points out that the UK undertook to maintain full alignment for Northern Ireland with the relevant rules of both the customs union and the single market, and this paper only addresses the former. There is no agreement, either, on whether ECJ jurisdiction will apply during the backstop period. Finally, the EU is unwilling to accept the whole of the UK remaining in the customs union and single market without the obligations of membership. Why is all this important? Because under the agreed terms of the Brexit negotiations, there can be no withdrawal agreement until every part of the deal is agreed. That means that without a legally binding backstop clause there can be no transition deal, no outline accord on the future relationship – and no withdrawal agreement. And without a withdrawal agreement, Britain crashes out of the EU in what almost all experts agree would be a catastrophic no-deal Brexit in March",682,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/07/brexit-what-is-the-uks-backstop-proposal
28,"The UK will only be able to reach a collective reconciliation after the disastrous divisions of the past two years if it holds a further referendum on any final Brexit deal, the German parliament foreign affairs committee chairman Norbert Röttgen has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Röttgen, a prominent member of Angela Merkel CDU governing party, said both sides needed to make concessions to reach an agreement if a catastrophic no-deal was to be avoided. Brussels rejects Theresa May plea to break Brexit deadlock He said: “In my opinion and from the outside, the only way Britain is to reach a reconciliation and end these deep divisions through society is if it holds a referendum in which no one can say, after two years of deep discussion, they did not know the consequences of Brexit. Very few knew the full consequences of Brexit after the first referendum.” He said he supported a three-choice referendum in which voters chose between the government deal, a no-deal Brexit and remaining in the European Union . Röttgen also joined criticism of Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, for using his party conference speech on Sunday to liken the European Union to a Russian prison. “Everyone understands the requirements of a party conference, but this rhetoric was disproportionate, and outside the boundaries of reasonableness. It will be remembered after the party conference. It matters that the foreign secretary shows responsibility in his language. “We thought the Boris Johnson-type rhetoric was gone and over, so it is sad to see it replicated again. He is one of the most senior figures in government and responsibility is required.” In one of the first signs that Germany may be willing to take up at least part of Theresa May Chequers proposals, Röttgen said the EU should be prepared to give the UK access to the single market in relation to goods, but not services, in return for the UK accepting EU rules and the customs union for goods. Conference or crack den? Tories fight over what left of their stash | John Crace He said the EU could in return offer unspecified concessions on free movement. Setting up an architecture allowing the frictionless movement of UK goods – in effect inside a customs union – would effectively solve the Northern Ireland border problem, he claimed. He said: “The EU is wrong to claim there can be no division between goods and services to maintain the integrity of the internal market. It is a position on which the EU has to change to find compromise. Britain, in order to resolve the border question, has to accept a frictionless regime of free movement of goods but without having any say on how the rules apply to Britain.” He said he recognised that parts of his proposals would be rejected by Eurosceptic Conservatives and many remainers, but there may be a constituency in the middle that sees his proposals as a way to break the deadlock. There has been growing concern in UK government circles that Merkel, weakened at home, is deferring to a harder-line France in the talks, making it more difficult to persuade the German chancellor to assert her instinct for a pragmatic compromise. It is thought the CDU has concerns that both sides are becoming locked into positions from which neither can escape, and this impasse may require the clock to be stopped on the talks this winter, in effect a decision to extend the article timetable leading to the UK leaving the EU next March. He said he saw no point in seeking to punish the UK to discourage others from leaving, claiming there was no evidence any other EU country wished to exit. Brexit disputes turn hairy on the fringe of the Tory conference He argued: “It is more rational to say, ‘Yes Brexit is disastrous, but the responsible answer is one of damage limitation, rather than punishment.’ “The apparent derailing in the talks in Salzburg was not planned, but an accident. European leaders thought Theresa May approach of either Chequers or no-deal was inappropriate. Her presentation at the EU dinner and in newspaper interviews led to outrage. “On the other hand, the topic was too serious for EU leaders to become as offended as they did. The language of rebuttal was too much. It should have been appreciated Chequers was a serious effort and led to the resignation of two cabinet members.”",736,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/02/referendum-only-way-to-heal-brexit-divisions-says-top-german-politician
29,"EU diplomats have rejected Theresa May conference pitch that Brussels must move first to break the deadlock over negotiations as Jean-Claude Juncker said British people were only “finding out now” about the scale of the problems caused by Brexit . The European commission president told an audience in Germany that he regretted that the voters had not been properly informed ahead of the Brexit referendum in He claimed that UK ministers were only now discovering the costs. “What I really regret is there was no real Brexit campaign in terms of actual information,” Juncker said. “In Great Britain the people are finding out now, also British ministers and ministers on the continent, they’re finding out now how many questions it actually poses, all the things that we need to resolve.” Juncker said British tourists’ pets would face four days of quarantine, and flights could indeed be grounded despite claims to the contrary emanating from Whitehall. “So if I start to even ask myself what going to happen to the dogs and cats that leave the European continent every year,” Juncker told an audience in Freiburg. “Right now they just pass through customs, all these dogs and cats coming to mainland Europe every year. There are lots of people in Europe who just want people and animals to cross borders but I think we’re just going to have four-day quarantine and if you want to go to Brittany for eight days for vacation then maybe you need to leave the dog or the cat at home but maybe you’ll just stay home altogether.” He added: ‘“What going to happen to air traffic in Europe? If everything goes wrong British planes will not be able to land on the European continent; people don’t know that. Somebody should’ve told them that beforehand.” The comments made in at a “citizens dialogue” event came as diplomats in Brussels raised doubts over a possibility of a substantive counter-offer being made by the EU. While the British government insists the ball is in the EU court in the talks, European diplomats speak of a more complex diplomatic dance, in which both sides publish papers during an intense negotiating period leading up to a crunch summit on October. Officials also repeated warnings that the EU would not accept the economic part of May Chequers plan, fearing it would hand British business a permanent competitive advantage over EU rivals. In interviews before the conference, the prime minister said the EU had to tell the British government what “detailed concerns” it had about her Chequers compromise plan. “If they’ve got counter-proposals, let hear what those counter-proposals are,” she told the BBC Andrew Marr show. On Monday the Brexit secretary Dominic Raab told Tory delegates that the EU “theological approach” allowed no room for serious compromise. “If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious. And they need to do it now.” In an interview with the Sun, he said the EU had not offered credible alternatives to the UK government proposals. “The ball is in their court.” Rejecting this characterisation, an EU source said both sides had to move if the talks were to progress: “In a way the ball is just as much in the UK court as the EU. We are at a point in the negotiations when neither side can say ‘the ball is in your court’. If the UK doesn’t pick up the ball, we will.” A senior source said the Brexiter campaign to “chuck Chequers”, was driving May to a free-trade agreement with the EU – the Canada-style deal that the prime minister has rejected as not good enough. “I can’t see how May the week after [party conference] can say: ‘You wanted to chuck Chequers. Well, we can stay in the customs union and single market.’ I think the dynamics are driving the UK to an FTA rather than an upgraded form of Chequers.” The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is drafting a non-binding political declaration on the future relationship with the UK. A senior diplomat said “counter-proposal would be “too strong a word” to describe this document, which has been planned for a long time. Linked to that text, Barnier is drawing up “improved” proposals on the Irish backstop. The backstop is the European commission fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, but May has said no British prime minister could ever accept Barnier version, which would keep Northern Ireland subject to many EU rules. The text of both documents is being tightly guarded by the European commission, leaving EU member states in the dark. Meanwhile the EU awaits the British government own counter-offer on the Irish backstop, after May promised alternatives that “preserve the integrity of the UK”, in an angry speech after her bruising experience at last month Salzburg summit. The British government complaints that the EU has not explained its reasons for rejecting the economic and customs plan of Chequers has been given short shrift in Brussels. “[May] said the EU had never explained, which is in fact not true,” said one diplomat. According to Brussels insiders, Barnier gave Raab a detailed briefing of the EU objections to the common rulebook , the centrepiece of the Chequers’ economic plan, allowing free movement of goods between the EU and UK. Barnier briefing notes, a three-page paper of “defensive points”, explain the commission problems with the common rulebook, across different industries. “The UK proposal would lead to a diversion of trade and investment in the UK favour and to the disadvantage of member states’ business,” states the unpublished document. It outlines how the UK could gain an advantage in some industries, if it only had to follow EU product standards, rather than broader social and environmental protection rules. In the European steel industry, for example, only of the cost of regulation is linked to EU product standards, while comes from EU rules on energy and climate change, according to the document. The document also explains why the commission is ready to hand an economic advantage to Northern Ireland, by keeping it in the customs union and subject to many (but not all) single market rules. EU insiders have worried that its Northern Ireland plan is a form of “cherry-picking”, but conclude it is necessary to preserve peace, while the size of the region means there is no serious risk. “With a population of million, Northern Ireland is much less of a competitive threat than the million UK.”",1082,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/01/eu-brussels-rejects-plea-from-theresa-may-to-break-brexit-deadlock
30,"We have long had serious concerns about the lack of due impartiality and accuracy in the reporting of allegations of antisemitism against Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party. The recent report by the Media Reform Coalition examining coverage of Labour revised code of conduct on antisemitism shows that we are right to be concerned. The research examined over articles and broadcast news segments and found over examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. In relation to the IHRA definition of antisemitism that was at the heart of the dispute, the research found evidence of “ overwhelming source imbalance ” in which critics of Labour code of conduct dominated coverage, with nearly of Guardian reports, for example, failing to include any quotes from those defending the code or critiquing the IHRA definition. Moreover, key contextual facts about the IHRA definition – for example that it has only been formally adopted by eight countries (and only six of the IHRA member states) – were consistently excluded. The researchers conclude these were not occasional lapses in judgment but “systematic reporting failures” that served to weaken the Labour leadership and to bolster its opponents within and outside of the party. It is of course entirely appropriate and necessary for our major news outlets to report on the horrors of antisemitism, but wrong to present it as an issue specific to the Labour party. In covering the allegations that Labour is now “ institutionally antisemitic ”, there have been inaccuracies, clear distortions and revealing omissions across our most popular media platforms. We believe that significant parts of the UK media have failed their audiences by producing flawed reports that have contributed to an undeserved witch-hunt against the Labour leader and misdirected public attention away from antisemitism elsewhere, including on the far right, which is ascendant in much of Europe.

31,"Peter Ricketts ( Britain needs to learn the EU negotiation rulebook , October) is of course right that insulting the EU isn’t going to help bring the Brexit negotiation to a sensible conclusion. But he is a little too kind in his description of the EU approach to the negotiations. I’m sure that Peter, like me, has participated in many EU negotiations where success finally depended on bending the EU tortuous rules to accommodate political reality. Very visible recent examples have been the rows over immigration and the waving through of excessive national budget deficits (at least for big countries). What is striking has been the complete unwillingness of the EU to look for similar flexibility when it comes to the question of Brexit . Had they had the wit to offer even cosmetic concessions on freedom of movement during David Cameron renegotiation, the referendum would very likely have gone the other way. And we seem now to be approaching the reductio ad absurdum of a major member state crashing out, with immense economic costs to both sides because the EU cannot find a fudge on the – by comparison minimal – issue of the Irish border. So, OK, let not insult them. But let us also be clear that, unless they can find a way to tinker at the edges with the fake purity of their principles, we face a major car crash with, I would guess, an extended period of deep hostility thereafter. Tony Brenton Cambridge Peter Ricketts reminds us that Britain choice is between two broad options: either a very close alignment with the single market and customs union, on the Norway model, or a clean break and in due course a free-trade agreement on the Canada model, with all that means for border checks and hence the Irish border. As the result was out and in, I think that is a clear mandate for being out, and the Norway model would fit that neatly. Martin Cooper Bromley, Kent Polly Toynbee advocacy ( Here is the vital speech May should have the courage to give , October) of a Finnish solution for the UK in its relationship with the EU rests on a misunderstanding. Finland was the only associate member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) from to because of her distinctive vulnerability to the Soviet Union. For the same reason Finland did not join the Council of Europe until The European Economic Area (EEA) only came into existence in and contains no provision for associate membership. In any case, most of the Efta members of the EEA – including Finland – opted for full membership of the EU. There is little reason to suppose that the remaining Efta members of the EEA would grant the UK associate status.

Dee Emsey ‘No-one is going to notice “more money in their pockets”’ Seeing as petrol has gone up about over the past year, the fuel duty pledge , apart from sending totally the wrong message environmentally, just means that people will be spending a tiny bit less on petrol than they actually are already.

It a placeholder of a political speech. The only actual thing she mentioned of any note is fuel duty, which is a shiny bauble to distract from the otherwise vacuum of content. Billy ‘This waving of the “patriotism” flag is stupid’ While anyone can understand May being irritated by Johnson – he is, after all, a supremely irritating man – this waving of the “patriotism” flag is stupid.

We’ve had the Tories harking back to the spirit of Dunkirk; let go back another years and evoke the spirit of Nurse Edith Cavell , who said at her execution: “Patriotism is not enough, I must have no hatred or bitterness to anyone.” Doesn’t really apply to our Theresa, does it? susanjoyce ‘I find the war rhetoric downright insulting’ Joking aside, as an EU national I genuinely find these war rhetorics, this whipping up of the British electorate into a frenzy as if the UK was at war with the EU, downright insulting.

34,"The key sentence in your leader ( Vince Cable has a plan to motivate moderates, but not a clear enough purpose , September) is: “To protest against New Labour governments from a liberal-left position, only to then join forces with the Conservatives, was too violent a lurch for many of the party natural supporters.” One could rehearse again the extreme danger of every option available to the Liberal Democrats after the indecisive election, but the simple fact is that survival for the party in any coalition requires a proportional representation system at the following election, and&nbsp;Nick Clegg failed to deliver this. You also refer to Vince Cable “movement for moderates”, but this is another chimera. I have been a member of the Liberal party, then the Liberal Democrats , for over years, and never have my Liberal colleagues and I conceived of ourselves as “moderates”. No Liberal is moderate about poverty, civil liberties or a united Europe. The&nbsp;party certainly was not moderate in opposing the Iraq invasion. The political gap today is very different. It is for a confident progressive, radical&nbsp;and internationalist party that also espouses public service, devolution and pluralism – which&nbsp;is exactly where the Liberal&nbsp;Democrats&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;be. Michael Meadowcroft Liberal MP, Leeds West, The Guardian critique of Vince Cable was justified, but it might have spared him the omission of his knighthood in the five references to him as “Mr Cable”. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords It is good to see that Jo Swinson, deputy leader of the Lib Dems, has recognised her party role in enabling the penalising of the poor during the coalition government ( Lib Dems must ‘own the failures’ of coalition, says deputy leader , However, her pride in having pushed to “raise the personal allowance, and take the lowest paid out of income tax completely” seems misplaced. The Equality Trust comments that “as analysis after analysis has shown, increasing the personal tax allowance does not help families on the lowest incomes at all and helps those on higher incomes more than those in the bottom half”. It&nbsp;reported that, in the regressive personal allowance increase to would give a year to households in the bottom and more than times as much to households in the top – and nothing to those whose income fell below If the Lib Dems want to raise the incomes of the poorest, rather than giving more to the already well-off, a much more efficient measure is, as the Equality Trust suggests, to reduce the rate of withdrawal of universal credit (assuming it can be made to work efficiently) or to increase how much people can earn before benefits start to be withdrawn, both costing less and increasing incentives to work. Elizabeth York Northampton Nick Clegg demand that the Lib&nbsp;Dems should stop apologising for the coalition ( Clegg: stop saying sorry for coalition , September) may not be his response to my recent letter ( Centre-ground politics too often misdefined , August), but his continuing justification of the coalition falsehoods about the cause of the recession, the state of the economy in and the assault on the wellbeing of the poor, which started under the government of which he was a senior member, is astonishing. They did not stop the Tories introducing more divisive measures and, had they stood aside, it would have been possible to turn the Cameron government out when its bungling became serious – say, at the time of the “ omnishambles ”. Clearly, if the Lib Dems wish to restore the support they once enjoyed, they should not only apologise for the coalition, but also for Mr Clegg; he is an albatross around their necks and the quicker they realise that, the better the fortunes of the party will be. Les Summers Kidlington, Oxfordshire Nick Clegg wants the Lib Dems to stop saying sorry. The problem is that the impact of university tuition fees will last for a long while. Clegg is a bit like the Black Death – he has a legacy. Terry Ward Wickford, Essex If Nick Clegg hoped that the Lib Dems would emerge from the coalition “as some kind of stabilising agent in&nbsp;British politics” ( Liberalism has to be rebuilt. Just not by the Lib&nbsp;Dems , Journal, September), he needed to strike a much better deal with David Cameron than a referendum on an alternative voting system. This lost referendum lost us the chance of electoral reform that many voters hoped for when they elected a hung parliament in In place of reform he swallowed George Osborne false argument for austerity cuts, resulting in the destruction of local government in our most disadvantaged towns.

35,"Business groups and professional organisations have reacted with alarm after the migration advisory committee, an independent expert body that advises government, said that lower-skilled workers should not get work permits to come to the UK after Brexit and that higher-skilled workers from the EU should not get preferential treatment compared to higher-skilled workers form outside the EU. This is probably what many people who voted leave in wanted, but the prospect of having to manage under the MAC rules, without free movement, has worried employers reliant on blue-collar workers (eg, the haulage industry - see and those reliant on professionals (eg, architects - see . Big business (the CBI - see and small businesses (the FSB - see are equally unhappy. In some respects the MAC recommendations are academic because it acknowledges that the government may want to negotiate preferential access for EU workers as part of the Brexit deal. (It does not formally recommend this, but it implies it would be sensible, saying preferential access would be “something of value to offer”.) But it has also been strongly criticised by Yvette Cooper , the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, for not setting out the costs and benefits of such an offer. (See Alan Travis , the Guardian former home affairs editor, sums it up like this. The committee has quashed claims that EU migration has had a significant, negative impact on wages, services and house prices. It explores the impact of EU migration in considerable detail and overall its verdict is that the impact has been more modest than supporters or opponents claim. It acknowledges some advantages and some disadvantages, and summarises them in a chart here. Opposition to EU immigration was one of the factors that led to the UK voting leave in But Prof Alan Manning, the committee chair, said that the fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote almost certainly did more to make people poor than EU immigration did. (See Police chiefs have said a no-deal Brexit would mean the loss of an array of crime-fighting tools and that any planned replacements would be less effective. BMW plans to shut its Mini plant for a month after the UK official departure from the European Union, to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts. Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, has walked into a row over his demand that the EU compromises in the Brexit talks, as the European council president, Donald Tusk, warned that the “catastrophe” of a no-deal scenario was “still quite possible”. Tusk has confirmed that an emergency EU summit is being planned for November to finalise a Brexit deal. (See Vince Cable has urged Liberal Democrat activists to lead a “crusade” to liberate Britain from the “Brexit nightmare”, by making common cause with moderates from other parties. John McDonnell said he wanted a woman to become the next leader of the Labour party, a day after senior party figures were accused of failing to take allegations of sexual harassment seriously enough. Polling conducted in constituencies and on Eurosceptic issues of “potential strategic significance” to Ukip did not breach UK donation rules, an investigation has found. That all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at BST What MAC says about impact of EU migration on wages Here is an extract from the MAC report summarising what it says about the impact of EU migration on wages. It has lowered wages for the poorest (those in low percentiles), but increased them at the top. The overall effect, though, is slight, says the report (pdf). These extracts are from pages and The new updated results [of research conducted for the MAC] show the same pattern of effects across the UK-born wage distribution as in the original study, with negative impacts at the bottom of the distribution and positive impacts at the top. In terms of magnitude, the estimates for all immigrants are similar to those from the original paper. These suggest that for a percentage point increase in the EU-born working age population ratio there is an associated per cent decrease in UK-born wages at the and percentiles, a per cent fall at the percentile and a per cent increase at the percentile. Given the percentage point increase in the EU-born working age population ratio between and the implied total effect on UK-born wages of EU immigration is of the order of a per cent reduction to the and percentiles, a per cent reduction to the percentile and a per cent increase at the percentile. As previously stated this type exercise should be interpreted with caution as the model only estimates the short-run response to migration. Economic theory, and evidence, suggests that any short-run impact is likely to dissipate overtime. Again, it is useful to place these estimates in context. Over this whole period, hourly real wages for UK-born workers increased by per cent and per cent at the and percentile respectively, per cent at the percentile and per cent at the percentile. These estimates therefore suggest that EU immigration had a relatively small impact on overall wage growth ... Taken altogether the existing evidence and the analysis we presented here suggests that immigration is not a major determinant of the wage growth experienced by existing residents. There is some suggestion that the impact on lower skilled groups may be more negative than for higher-skilled groups, but again these estimates are imprecise and subject to uncertainty. And here is some more reaction to the MAC report from various political and professional bodies. From Luke Cooper, convenor of Another Europe Is Possible , which campaigned for a remain vote in and for progressive reform of the EU This report is a strange and contradictory. It confirms that EEA migration is good for Britain. But then proposes to scrap the system of free movement which has underpinned this success. The great advantage of free movement is that it is a system of rights and responsibilities. Moving to a system of work permits where migrants have less rights could have significant unintended consequences. Canada in particular should not be held up as a model given its temporary foreign workers’ programme has been repeatedly criticised by migrant rights campaigners and trade unions as mandating exploitative labour market practices. From the former Labour MP Gisela Stuart , chair of the pro-Brexit Change Britain The UK post-Brexit immigration policy should attract talent from across the world, therefore it absolutely right for the report to reject a preferential system for EU migrants ... The government must act on the recommendations of this report to restore democratic trust in our border policy and create the immigration system our economy needs. From Donna Kinnair, acting general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing This report puts paid to the damaging misbelief that migrant workers are a drain on health and care services. The independent experts found that the reliance of the NHS and social care on overseas professionals far outweighs the cost of their care. However, when we know that the training of healthcare staff in EU countries is very similar to our own, the call for there to be no preferential treatment for EU staff to work in the UK after Brexit represents a missed opportunity. Only last week, vacant jobs in the NHS in England hit a record high. With no long term strategy to alleviate shortages, the future UK immigration system must be equipped to recruit and keep the brightest and best professionals – patient safety depends on it. The Committee call to remove the limit on highly skilled workers from other countries is welcome. The UK has long depended on nursing professionals from around the world and any future cap on their numbers would leave health and social care services unable to recruit the nurses they need. From Louise Wren, policy manager for the health charity Wellcome The research workforce is highly mobile and connected, and the success of science depends on this. Today recommendations could have a severely detrimental impact on the research community. Even with the potential changes to the tier visa system proposed by the migration advisory committee, the system isn’t quick or agile and is costly. From Alan Vallance, chief executive of the Royal Institute of British Architects The recommendations in today report would have profound implications for architecture. One in five architects working in the UK are from the EU and after freedom of movement ends, it is crucial to create a post-Brexit immigration system that helps protect the workforce and addresses long-standing problems. It is disappointing that the committee has recommended introducing a immigration skills charge to employ EU nationals and that it has not moved on the onerous salary threshold. Both of these measures will hit smaller practices the hardest. The SNP has restated its call for the Scottish parliament to take control of immigration policy for Scotland. It has put out this statement from Stuart McDonald MP about the MAC reports. It is vital that immigration powers are now devolved to the Scottish Parliament to ensure we can build a system that meets Scotland specific needs and values. The UK government ‘Little Britain’ hostile approach to immigration is damaging Scotland economy and public services - by deterring the talent we need to attract to live, work and study here. Westminster has proven itself to be utterly incapable of standing up for Scotland needs and interests on immigration – and all the signs suggest that the Tories’ right-wing post-Brexit vision for immigration will cause even more self-inflicted harm, at the worst possible time for the country. I plan to wrap up the blog at about Comments will close at around MAC proposals concerning for small business says FSB The Federation of Small Businesses says the migration advisory committee recommendations are “deeply concerning” for the small business community. This is from its chairman, Mike Cherry. The MAC report is deeply concerning for the small business community. per cent of small businesses in the UK employ someone from the EU and yet they will be the ones hit the hardest by the huge added costs and administrative burdens of the proposals outlined in the MAC report. Our research shows that ninety-five per cent of small employers had never made use of the UK points-based immigration system to meet their business’ labour and skills needs. This is because of the costs and complexity of the system. Simply expanding the tier general route to include EEA citizens will hurt small businesses, the wider economy and productivity. The damage will be worse for those businesses that work in sectors like hospitality, retail and care that are already facing chronic skills shortages. Small businesses will be pleased to see the suggestion that focus should be given to mid-skilled workers, but disappointed not to see a concerted action plan around them. While access to high-skilled labour is vital to the UK small businesses, even more important to them are those who are mid-skilled - such as mechanics, care workers, office administrators. Talking about the informal EU summit in Salzburg starting tomorrow, Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, told the Irish parliament today: I do not anticipate there will be any change to the EU position or any change to our negotiating guidelines. Most of the comment on the Vince Cable speech from journalists that I’ve seen on Twitter has focused on his “erotic spasm” verbal slip. (See Here are some of the more general comments. From the Daily Mirror Kevin Maguire From the BBC Norman Smith From the Mirror Jason Beattie From the Times’ Patrick Kidd Here is the text of the Vince Cable speech. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart story about Sir Vince Cable’ s speech. Vince Cable calls on Lib Dems to liberate Britain from 'Brexit nightmare' And here is how it starts. Vince Cable has urged Liberal Democrat activists to lead a “crusade” to liberate Britain from the “Brexit nightmare”, by making common cause with moderates from other parties. The Lib Dem leader was giving the closing address to his party annual conference in Brighton, where he sketched out reforms aimed at tempting a wave of new supporters to sign up for what he has called a “march of the moderates”. He insisted the Lib Dems would be “leading the resistance to the forces of illiberalism. Leading a crusade to give the people the final say on our future in Europe , and looking outwards to a changing world, with confidence and determination that our values will outlast and outclass the forces ranged against them.” of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Liberal Democrats Migration Immigration and asylum Donald Tusk European Union",2124,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/18/brexit-mac-migration-eu-confirms-emergency-summit-planned-for-november-to-finalise-brexit-deal-politics-live
36,"here an art to announcing the time of one departure. Make it too late and it will look to everyone as if you’ve been pushed. Make it too immediate and it will look as if you are desperately clinging on to power. Vince Cable has seemingly achieved the impossible by doing both at the same time. Vince Cable calls on Lib Dems to liberate Britain from 'Brexit nightmare' For a while now there has been a widespread feeling among Liberal Democrat activists that Cable has to go. As a leader he been more black hole than rallying cry. An absence rather than a presence. But last week, when he sought to reassure his party that he wasn’t going to be around for too long he only made things worse by saying he would stay until Brexit was either resolved or stopped. That could be years. Years in which most Lib Dems would rather Cable took a back seat. There also an art to announcing one arrival. Cable is not immune to vanity and self delusion, but even he can see the writing on the wall. There was a time when he could have been the party poster boy – the man who could tell it like it was – but now he is yesterday man. Nick Clegg has commanded far more interest than the Lib Dem leader at this year conference, while some of the party faithful have openly lamented the loss of Tim Farron charisma. Things really are that bad. So both Cable and his audience were anticipating his closing speech with some trepidation. Something to be endured rather than enjoyed. But Cable had wanted to make an instant impression on everyone. A soundbite that would make the news headlines. To his credit, he managed it. Just not in the way he intended. He had imagined himself bouncing on to the stage, his eyes smouldering as he made intimate contact with those in the front rows and got the whole hall eating out of his hands as he made a risque gag about the Tory party being locked in an “erotic spasm” over Brexit. Come again, Vince! Ooh, yes please! He’d worked on the line, time and again the night before in his hotel room. And each time he absolutely nailed it. Hell, he was king of the Lib Dem sex scene. Only the year before he had written Open Arms, a far from best-selling thriller about a whole bunch of people who were secret Lib Dems, in which emotional and physical dams constantly burst within the main characters. Nobody did it better than Cable. Who the Daddy? Except when the words “erotic spasm” appeared on the autocue, he just couldn’t bring himself to say them. What came out was an entirely different, involuntary, emission. “Exotic spresm,” he garbled, somehow managing the almost impossible feat of sounding both more and less embarrassing than he had originally intended. The audience didn’t know whether to laugh or try to pretend that it had never happened. Lib Dems feel they're finally being heard on Brexit. Even if they're not | John Crace The exotic spresm rather did for the rest of the speech. Which was a problem as there were still minutes to go. He went through his well-scripted routine of slagging off Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, but the spark just wasn’t there. Just the odd smatterings of polite applause as he ploughed on in a dull monotone. Seldom had a call to action to stop Brexit been made to sound so depressing. Or futile. We’re here because we’re here because we’re here: the new mantra of Cable Lib Dems. What he wanted was a march of the moderates. The moderates quite fancied a march too. They just didn’t want one with Cable leading from the front. That much was clear. Almost half the conference hall had been curtained off to make it look as if it were more full than it actually was, and the few security guards present were there more to make sure nobody left than to prevent anyone getting out of hand. Chance would be a fine thing. The march of the moderates slowed to a near plod. Most leaders’ speeches aim to end on a high. Cable just petered out. With not even one final exotic spresm to send everyone home with a smile on their face.",731,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/18/vince-cables-exotic-spasm-fails-to-rouse-lib-dem-conference
37,"Vince Cable has urged Liberal Democrat activists to lead a “crusade” to liberate Britain from the “Brexit nightmare”, by making common cause with moderates from other parties.

He insisted the Lib Dems would be “leading the resistance to the forces of illiberalism. Leading a crusade to give the people the final say on our future in Europe , and looking outwards to a changing world, with confidence and determination that our values will outlast and outclass the forces ranged against them.” Liberalism needs to be rebuilt – just not by the Lib Dems | Rafael Behr In a strongly worded attack on both major parties, Cable said Labour and the Tories had been captured by the extremes – and the Lib Dems must “extend the hand of friendship” to disillusioned members from both. “Let them in. And if they are too shy to come in, let us extend the hand of friendship and co-operate with them,” he said. He added: “The two big parties have changed from broad churches into intolerant cults. And those who question the faith are unwelcome.” With the prime minister battling to secure a deal with Brussels, which she will then have to bring back to parliament for approval, Cable hopes the Lib Dems can profit from the deep divisions rocking Labour and the Conservatives. “The Labour leadership is dominated by people who believe in doctrines far removed from the sensible social democratic tradition which prevailed from the days of Clement Attlee to Gordon Brown.” “They in turn are the mirror image of the Tory zealots who have more in common with Ukip than their party one nation traditions,” he said. Cable added that Brexit “fundamentalists” were prepared to risk the economic future of the poorest people in the UK in return for leaving the EU in an “erotic spasm” – a phrase that he garbled in his delivery. “For the true believers – the fundamentalists – the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant,” he will say. “Economic pain felt, of course, not by them [but] by those least able to afford it.” He compared the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson to the US president, Donald Trump, calling the pair “the terrible twins of the rabid right”. As the negotiations in Brussels reach their endgame, and with a growing number of MPs in both parties publicly backing another Brexit referendum, Cable said: “Much now depends on the courage of mainstream MPs in the Labour and Conservative parties. They are losing control and if they can’t stop the rot, they should leave.” He also sought to capitalise on Labour internal woes, saying party members should “wave goodbye” to Jeremy Corbyn if he fails to shift his position and endorse the idea of a “people vote”. Labour will gather in Liverpool next weekend, with its members set to discuss the issue of a people vote on the conference floor, after it was forced on to the agenda by trade unions and local parties. The Lib Dems performed strongly in May local elections, gaining three councils, including in Cable backyard in south-west London. But there has been widespread speculation about Cable future in recent weeks, with aides conceding that if the parliament runs to its full five years, so that the next general election would be in the now year old would not fight it as leader. He sidestepped the question of his personal future in the speech, instead setting out a series of policies he said would equip Britain for a future beyond Brexit. In particular, party members voted on Tuesday to back radical tax reforms that would abolish inheritance tax, instead taxing the recipients of large bequests – or lifetime gifts – at their own marginal tax rate, above a lifetime allowance. Capital gains tax would also be levied at the same rate as income tax under the proposals. The Lib Dems say the package would raise about in total – one-third of which would be set aside to create a sovereign wealth fund. At last year general election, the Lib Dems failed to make gains on the scale then-leader Tim Farron had hoped for, with the party anti-Brexit message overshadowed by his personal beliefs. He stepped aside shortly afterwards, giving way to Cable, who was business secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition of Senior party figures clashed in Brighton this week over whether they should celebrate or deplore the decisions they supported while in government. Cable deputy, Jo Swinson, said the Lib Dems needed to “own the failures” of that period; while the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg insisted he remained proud of the party role. “There is this narrative hung round the Lib Dem party neck, which is just false, that we sold our soul, merrily went along with a savage, ideological approach to austerity which deliberately penalised the poor. It is simply not true,” Clegg said.",856,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/18/vince-cable-liberal-democrats-party-conference-brexit
38,"The most senior civil servant in Northern Ireland has said a no deal Brexit could make trade impossible for some firms in Northern Ireland. As the Press Association reports, David Sterling, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, told an event in Brussels that many local firms could be very badly affected in these circumstances. He said: I cannot stray into political territory. However you will not be surprised to hear that we have deep concerns about the risk that no deal is agreed and there is chaotic exit from the EU. Under such a scenario, costs for our businesses could significantly increase or create what might just [make it] impossible for many firms, particularly in our agri-food supply chains, to trade normally in this era of ‘just in time’ processing and manufacturing. In the life cycle of many goods they have to cross the land border many times. Our research has shown that two-thirds of cross-border trade involves supply chain activity. How would this work if they had to make customs and VAT declarations each time? John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has urged Philip Hammond, the chancellor, to rule out a no deal Brexit. Speaking after the publication of today IMF report on the state of the economy, McDonnell said: Today the IMF has underlined the warnings that we’ve already heard from trade unions and business organisations about the damage that a cliff edge Brexit would do to our economy. Once again I call on the chancellor to show some leadership and make it clear to his colleagues that he will not accept a no deal Brexit and the damage it risks doing to jobs, wages and living standards in this country. Bex Bailey, the Labour activist who revealed she was raped at a party event in has criticised party leaders for refusing to publish a report that accuses them of having “accommodated” sexual harassment, the Independent reports. Bailey spoke out in an interview on the BBC PM programme broadcast just now.

That all from me for today. Comments will close at Chequers: the video - A review Here are some stills from Chequers - the video. Frankly, one feels for the poor soul in the Downing Street communications team tasked with the job of turning the government Brexit white paper (the document that sets out the Chequers plan) into a snazzy Facebook video suitable for social media sharing. In the circumstances he or she has done a pretty good job - except for the fact that, at minutes and seconds, it about minutes too long. And it doesn’t have any cats. They should have got Larry involved. But perhaps he wasn’t interested. Still, here are some of the more interesting images from the production. This one accompanies a passage where Theresa May (who provides the voice over) explains that, even though Chequers marks a compromise (or a “significant shift”, as she puts it, in the UK position), some red lines remain. This one gives an indication as to the quality of the drawing involved. (On second thoughts, perhaps Larry was involved - he couldn’t have done much worse.) And this one is worth noting because it shows how “taking back control of our own laws” (supposed to be one of the main benefits of Brexit) has now become (in May words) ending some EU legislation becoming law in the UK without parliament ever considering it. That because, under Chequers, the UK would remain bound by the EU rulebook for goods and would be expected to pass its own laws mirroring any new EU legislation in this area. (Parliament could, of course, refuse, but that would have trade or financial consequences.) Updated at BST No releases Facebook video to help sell Chequers plan Downing Street has unveiled - Chequers, the video. Updated at BST Jaguar Land Rover has announced that more than staff will move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands, only hours after the carmaker was accused of “scaremongering” about the impact of Brexit by a Conservative MP, my colleague Rob Davies reports. More than Jaguar Land Rover staff will go to three-day week Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, has been in Madrid today for a meeting with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez. In a tweet he says there can be a Brexit deal provided the integrity of the single market is maintained - a condition that the EU has imposed from day one. Clegg says he be a British Macron Nick Clegg told a fringe meeting at the Lib Dem conference that he could not be a British Macron. The former Lib Dem deputy prime minister said: I’d love to think some sort of British Macron would come charging over the horizon and save us all from Brexit . But the secret to these breakthrough characters is precisely that they arrive relatively unencumbered by baggage. Clegg said his own role in the coalition meant that he could not perform this role. I can’t pretend that you can suddenly shed all that baggage and have a completely fresh start. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel. New characters will emerge to lead that political renewal. I plan to wrap up the blog at around And we plan to close the comments at some point between around and Osborne says Home Office was to plight of child refugees when May was in charge In today Evening Standard, George Osborne , the editor and former Conservative chancellor, says that when Theresa May was home secretary, the Home Office was “unsympathetic” to the plight of child refugees. Osborne makes the point in an “editor reply” column to a letter from the Labour peer Alf Dubs praising Sajid Javid, the current home secretary, for his recent decision to allow children from the Calais refugee camp now living in the UK a new right to remain. Osborne wrote: Sajid Javid has, as you say, done a “good thing” for those children who have arrived since We should not underestimate the symbolism of this step by the home secretary. I know from my own experience of raising these issues in the cabinet how unsympathetic the Home Office was when it came to asking for help. Dismantling the “hostile environment” that was created during those years is going to take time. By the standard of some of Osborne previous jibes at May (she sacked him when she became PM, of course), this is relatively mild, but it does undermine May attempts to depict herself (see PMQs last week) as a champion of of social justice. Lunchtime summary Theresa May has insisted that the only alternative to her Chequers plan is crashing out of the European Union with no deal, prompting her critics on the right of the Tory party to say she risks a “car crash” if she sticks to her policy. She was speaking in an interview with the BBC Nick Robinson for a Panorama programme being broadcast tonight. See for a full summary and analysis. Downing Street has mocked Boris Johnson for using his Telegraph column today to condemn an EU Irish backstop proposal that he endorsed when he was a member of the cabinet. Johnson has now put the full text of his column on his Facebook page. Anti-Brexit campaigners have claimed that, even if everyone who voted in the EU referendum were to vote the same way again, demographic changes mean that the UK population will have a remain majority by March when the UK leaves . Peter Kellner , the former YouGov president, has done the analysis for the People Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on the final Brexit deal. His analysis involves looking at how the people voted in and then calculating how population changes - the death of mostly older voters, based on average death rates, and the fact that people who were too young to vote two years ago are now over - will have altered the mix. It assumes people would vote as they did in and does not take into account evidence showing there has, separately, been a slight shift to remain. There is a very strong correlation between being older and voting leave, and previously Kellner calculated that the crossover point - the moment when remain would outnumber leave, assuming everyone still alive voted as they did two years ago - would come in November next year. But in the light of new polling showing that the “new voters” (people who are or now) are even more pro-remain than assumed has led him to conclude the the crossover point will come on January next year. Kellner said: YouGov latest figures tell us how those who were not yet last time would vote now. Those who say they are certain to vote divide seven-to-one for remain. This matters statistically: for it helps to explain why demographic factors alone will cause the UK this winter to switch from a leave country to a remain country. Because this cross-over point occurs before March – when the UK is due to leave the EU – it means the British public view of Brexit will have changed even without anyone who voted two years changing their mind. Young people who were not eligible to vote in and can do so now make it much harder for anyone to claim that Brexit is still the ‘will of the people’. Older voters are just as keen on leaving the EU as they were two years ago, younger voters are moving even more strongly into the remain camp – and the very youngest voters back continued membership of the EU by a remarkable margin. It is very rare for a significant demographic group to support one side so overwhelmingly on an issue that splits the nation down the middle. What is more, young voters are the ones who will still be dealing with the long-term consequences of the current Brexit drama in ten or years’ time, long after many leave voters have gone. Today young voters are making clear that they want a pro-European inheritance – and are ready to stand up and be counted, in a fresh public vote. The UK economy would rapidly start to contract in the event of a disruptive exit from the EU next spring, according to a stark International Monetary Fund report that highlights the recession risks of a no-deal Brexit. Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative Brexiter, has accused the head of Jaguar Land Rover of inventing dire consequences for his company of a no-deal Brexit, saying people no longer believed the “scaremongers” in the debate. A proposal to move the statue of the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst from near the Houses of Parliament to the private Regent University London in Regent Park has been withdrawn after widespread anger. Prospective parents should be banned from using a blood test to determine the sex of their baby in the early stages of pregnancy, Labour has said. In response to Theresa May suggestion that MPs will face a binary choice between her Chequers plan and a no deal Brexit , Ukip says they should opt for no deal. This is from the Ukip leader Gerard Batten. After a summer of dripping Project Fear into the public ears, Mrs May has put down an in or out option. Ukip has always said that no deal, which is really reverting to WTO terms, is better than a bad deal with the EU. Mrs May deal, whatever the particulars, will not be what the British people voted for on June it will be Brexit in name only. I call on all leave MPs to reject the flimsy agreement Mrs May is putting together and support a full unencumbered exit from the EU under World Trade Organisation rules.

39,"Nick Clegg has said the Liberal Democrats should stop apologising for their time in coalition with the Conservatives, in a sideswipe at the call from the future leadership favourite, Jo Swinson, for the party to “ own the failures ”. Speaking at the Lib Dems’ annual conference in Brighton, the former deputy prime minister said: “One of the golden rules of politics is don’t say stuff that reinforces your opponent. “We went into coalition eight years ago, there is something quite Lib Dem about still thinking about the things we did or didn’t feel comfortable with when we entered into government so long ago.” Clegg said he did not believe mea culpas to be election-winning strategies. “In the end, you have to give a clear message; are you basically proud of who you are, or not?” he said. Lib Dems feel they're finally being heard on Brexit. Even if they're not | John Crace “There is this narrative hung round the Lib Dem party neck, which is just false, that we sold our soul, merrily went along with a savage, ideological approach to austerity which deliberately penalised the poor. It is simply not true.” Swinson, the party deputy leader , who was a business minister in the coalition, cited the bedroom tax and hostile immigration environment as regrettable policies. “When they fought dirty, we were too nice,” she said. The main draw on the conference floor on Monday was the anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller , tipped as a potential future leader of the party if changes allowing non-MPs to stand are voted through. However, the businesswoman, who led the legal fight for a parliamentary vote on article said she would not stand for leader or join the party. “Today I speak to you as a friend and someone who feels a bond with you on many issues, but may I say straight away, particularly for the benefit of the journalists here in this hall who have been doing a great deal of speculating lately, I am not addressing you as your leader-in-waiting,” she said. “Truth be told, I am not a member of your party, or indeed any party now, but I want, all the same, to see the Liberal Democrats thrive, because in a healthy democracy we need a strong third party, every bit as much as we need a strong opposition, and, for that matter, a strong government and a strong prime minister.” Speaking to journalists afterwards, Miller expressed irritation that she is often portrayed as wanting to “stop Brexit”. She said: “I wish you would all stop saying this, you know, it really not helpful: stop saying ‘stop Brexit’.” Miller also expressed doubts about the phrase “people vote” as a slogan for those campaigning, as she is, for the public to be given a say on the final Brexit deal. “I don’t like the phrase,” she said. “It not definite enough. It doesn’t have enough detail behind it.” On the conference floor in Brighton, Lib Dems backed a move to unilaterally revoke article if the prime minister cannot secure an exit deal by March, to avoid a no-deal scenario . Party members also supported an activist amendment by which the UK could opt to stay in the EU without a second referendum or general election, though with some tacit backing from the leadership. The policy seeks to extend the article period in an attempt to secure another referendum. However, the policy states that if no deal has been reached and no referendum is in sight, the UK should “withdraw the article notification” if the EU will not allow an extension.",603,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/17/stop-apologising-for-coalition-nick-clegg-tells-lib-dems
40,"ou have to hand it to the Liberal Democrats , they know how to make their party conferences a little different. If only by giving them the feeling of a slightly autumnal, past its best, end-of-the-pier show. Take the merchandise stalls at this year event in Brighton. A hi-vis vest with a Lib Dem logo for the hound in your life? Mmm. Maybe not. An card with an orange Lib Dem motif? Just what every teenager wants. Or three different Tim Farron fridge magnets? I’m not sure there a market even for one. For several years now, the Lib Dem conference has been less a celebration of the party triumphs than a soft howl of pain . A polite raging against the dying of the light. A plea for relevance at a time when Lib Dems feel like an endangered species. Not even the truest believers ever tried to talk up winning MPs at the general election last year as a massive gain. It was a party whose sole remaining purpose was seemingly to stay one step ahead of oblivion. Even the occasional defiant messages of optimism from the conference stage had the hollow sound of despair. Stop apologising for coalition, Nick Clegg tells Lib Dems This year, though, there was a slight change of mood. Where previously the Lib Dems could only collectively hold their heads in their hands as they warned of the catastrophe Brexit would bring, they now feel as if their voices are being heard . Even if they probably aren’t. If the chances of a “people vote” have increased dramatically over the past six months, it almost certainly has everything to do with the hopelessness of the government EU negotiating strategy rather than the public finally hearing the Lib Dem message. No matter. A win is a win and, whether by accident or design, the Lib Dems feel they are just about back in the game. So the Lib Dems did what only they could. They invited Gina Miller to give the keynote speech to Monday conference. How better to make it clear to everyone in the party that none of its MPs had the charisma to hold a crowd or say anything about Europe that would be worth listening to for minutes? The snappers duly picked up their cues. Having mysteriously remained silent while Tom Brake and Wera Hobhouse spoke in the earlier debate, the cameras flashed into action when Miller took her seat minutes before she was due to speak. It had been thought that Vince Cable might have invited Miller as an overture to getting the Lib Dems to accept someone who wasn’t an MP as leader. But Miller was quick to scotch that rumour. She wasn’t a leader-in-waiting, she declared at the beginning of her speech. She wasn’t even a Lib Dem. Heaven forbid. The Lib Dems were far too niche and she planned to reach a far bigger audience. She liked the Lib Dems and agreed with many of their aims on Brexit. Though rather in the manner she might treat a pet. Perhaps the hi-vis dog jacket might have a taker after all. “I’m not political,” Miller explained, somewhat disingenuously. It would be interesting to know what her definition of political was. Miller was the woman who defeated the government in the high court and the supreme court over parliament right to have a vote in triggering article and was most recently seen posing near the edge of the white cliffs of Dover as she launched her End the Chaos website to help steer the country to a second referendum. Still, she a busy woman, so maybe these are just hobbies she indulges in during her spare time. Her speech was functional, but nothing more. Miller covered enough of the main bases – including several plugs for her website – to keep the conference hall happy, but she never really sparkled. She lacked any real passion. Maybe she was nervous, but this felt more like the Queen Christmas message. A semi-detached pep talk to her people, rather than a whole-hearted call to arms. It will take more than this to convince many Brexiters. But it was enough to earn her a standing ovation. Stardust is thin on the ground in Brighton this week and the delegates are grateful for what they can get. As she left, the hall immediately began to clear, with several people falling upstairs behind her. The chairperson announced conference would reconvene at It was now A two-and-a-half hour lunch break.

41,"The Liberal Democrats must “own the failures” of the coalition government, the party deputy leader, Jo Swinson, has said, citing the “hostile environment” , the bedroom tax and NHS changes as policies she particularly regreted. Swinson, a former business minister tipped as a future leader, said the party had inflicted too high a price on the poorest in society in an attempt to cut the deficit. “I’m proud of what we achieved, but I’m not naive or blinkered about it,” she told the Lib Dem conference in Brighton on Sunday. “If we are to claim the successes of our time in government, we need to own the failures of it too. We lost too many arguments. When they fought dirty, we were too nice.” Cable rejects Lib Dem coalition with ‘appalling’ main parties The MP, who regained her East Dunbartonshire seat in June last year after losing it in said she was particularly proud of some of the coalition achievements, adding that she had fought the Tories “in budget after budget to raise the personal allowance, and take the lowest paid out of income tax completely”. However, she said it was clear the Lib Dems should have done more to push back against some coalition policies. “Negotiating with the Conservatives meant compromise. And some of those compromises sucked,” she said. “We should have done more. More to stop Theresa May hostile environment, more to block Andrew Lansley disruptive NHS reforms, more to prevent Iain Duncan Smith punishing bedroom tax. We were right to cut the deficit, but those who were already struggling paid too high a price.” Swinson comments caused some discomfort among her colleagues. Speaking to reporters after her speech, the party home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey , a cabinet minister during the coalition, bristled at some of the criticism. “I’m not one of those who think we should deny all the amazing things we did in the coalition,” he said. “One of the reasons I’m loving the Brighton conference is those offshore wind turbines out there. I signed the contract for that. Because Liberal Democrats were in government, those offshore wind turbines have been built. “Do you think I’m gonna deny that? I’m deeply proud of that. You’ve got to remember in coalition we were fighting some of their immigration policies, we stopped a lot, we weren’t going to stop everything.” Earlier, Swinson, seen as a possible replacement for the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, who has said he will not fight a general election, said she was relaxed about the party proposed changes to allow non-MPs to stand for leader , a move that could see her edged out of any forthcoming race. “You don’t need to set up a new party because the Liberal Democrats are here, but we recognise that we have to change in order to make it easier for people that perhaps haven’t looked at us before to look again at the Lib Dems,” she told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Asked if she would consider running for the party leadership, she said: “There no vacancy at the moment … at the time that Vince does stand down, then absolutely I’ll take a view at that point.” Earlier in the day, the party conference voted on a new immigration policy paper rejecting the hostile environment. Davey said the Lib Dems would scrap the net migration target and end indefinite detention , as well as changing the border force. Lib Dem members also voted through amendments to give migrant spouses an entitlement to benefits from their first day in the UK, despite opposition from party chiefs and warnings from some activists that the Lib Dems would be “slaughtered” on the doorstep over the issue.",621,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/16/lib-dems-must-own-failures-of-coalition-says-jo-swinson
42,"ir Vince Cable has ruled out ever leading his party into a formal coalition with a Jeremy Corbyn-led government, a move he says would be just as “appalling” as working as junior partners in an administration run by Boris Johnson. The Liberal Democrat leader – who would have preferred to have joined forces with Labour under Gordon Brown rather than David Cameron Tories in had the parliamentary arithmetic allowed – used an interview with the Observer to suggest that Lib Dems could instead work together with disgruntled Labour MPs. He says the latter are planning to leave the party in droves if Corbyn becomes prime minister. Speaking on the eve of his party annual conference, which opens on Sunday in Brighton, Cable suggests he has already held discussions with disaffected Labour members about joining what he has called a new “movement for moderates” on the political centre ground. “If you talk to a lot of Labour backbenchers they just can’t, they’re not willing under any circumstances, to countenance a Corbyn government. It is quite extraordinary, that. Few of them say it publicly but most of them say it privately,” he says. Many of this group, he adds, are actively thinking about what career paths to take next. “That what a lot of them are doing. I talk to people in the charity world who tell me they’re being buried in CVs from Labour MPs. “They’re just getting out while the going is good. But if they formed a coherent group, I’ve said that whatever happens with our internal reforms, I want to work with them. There no point slitting each other throats.” With just MPs, and poll ratings struggling to move upwards (the Lib Dems are on in Sunday Opinium/ Observer poll), Cable is seeking a new mission for his party and his leadership as it draws to a close. Recently he announced that he would step down when Brexit was “resolved or stopped”, and outlined plans to allow non-MPs to enter the race to succeed him. Cable, also said the party would allow people to join as supporters without paying fees , in an attempt to reinvigorate it and place it at the heart of the centre-ground movement he seeks to build. As business secretary, Cable was a key figure in the coalition government from to Looking back, he has no regrets about teaming up with the Tories in the national interest, despite the punishing electoral consequences for his party. “I don’t think we had an alternative,” he says. “It may sound a bit deterministic but I think the very odd combination of numbers combined with the financial crisis and people out there saying the whole bloody place is going in flames. [In those circumstances] you can’t just sit there engaging in parliamentary games.” Now, however, despite Brexit and his fear that there could be another economic crash, Cable says the most he can see his party agreeing to, were there to be an election soon, is an arrangement under which Lib Dems would work with Labour or the Tories on individual issues. Coalitions look out of the question. “They’re both pretty appalling in different ways ... They’re both equally unacceptable,” he says. A year ago, before the last Lib Dem conference, Cable was on strikingly optimistic form , telling this newspaper he believed there was a decent chance he could become prime minister, so unpredictable was politics. His decision to pre-announce his own departure a few weeks ago, however, was confirmation that reality has dawned. He now seems to accept that the job of leader has proved more difficult than he expected. Above all, he says, it is hellishly hard work getting noticed as the leader of a small, moderate, third party, however hard you try. “I mean, I remember years ago when I was acting leader I had two questions a week in prime minister questions. I am now allowed one every four weeks. That is what the speaker judges we deserve. And on the back of that I had a Sunday newspaper column ... It is more difficult.” He tries not to sound frustrated. “It is not for want of trying, I assure you, and certainly I spend a lot of my time buzzing round the country. We are making headway but it is difficult.” Cable believes the chances of a second referendum on Brexit are rising but still puts the likelihood only at around Like everything else in the debate about the UK future relationship with the EU, it is impossibly difficult to predict – as is the timing of his own departure as leader, or who will succeed him. Asked if it should be a woman, Cable says: “It would fit with the spirit of the time, and there is a strong argument for doing it.” Most often mentioned is Jo Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, who made history last week by bringing her son into the Commons chamber for a debate. Cable says Swinson would be “good, very good. There are several others but she is an outstanding individual.” As for when he might go, Cable says he “deliberately avoided setting out a specific time. Politics is very uncertain. Let assume Brexit is wrapped up by March/April next year. It may be or may not be. We then get our reforms to put through, probably in a similar time frame. “There will be local elections in May. Then there is the likely chaotic outcome of Brexit producing a new prime minister wanting a new election. And I’m there to fight for us and lead us into it and lead us through the other side. What I said was, there are certain tasks to be done. I’m approaching this in a professional way. I’m doing my job. And then I will move on.”",970,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/16/vince-cable-woos-anti-corbyn-labour-for-moderate-bloc-lib-dem
43,"About two in five voters would be highly likely to vote for a new party in the political centre ground at a future election, a new poll for the Observer has revealed. Just over a third also say they felt unrepresented by the existing main parties on offer, according to the latest Opinium poll. It suggests there is appetite for a new party, with both Labour and the Tories suffering from long-running internal strife. While there is regular talk of new parties and splits, many possible supporters are put off by the difficulties of making a new project work under Britain first-past-the-post electoral system. The poll also reveals that almost half of voters do not see strong leadership from the two main parties, with believing Theresa May is not a strong leader and regarding Jeremy Corbyn as a weak leader. Tory infighting over Brexit: who won this week? The findings come with the Lib Dems attempting to pitch themselves as the right vehicle for moderates put off by the civil wars inside the Tories and Labour. The party annual conference starts this weekend, but it has failed to capitalise on the divisions inside its rivals. Speaking before his party conference in Brighton, Vince Cable said he wanted to “make an open pitch to the people of this country who are fed up with the extremes of the current Conservative and Labour parties”. 'Turn our fire outward': Corbyn calls for end to Labour infighting “Whether you see yourself as a liberal, social democrat, progressive, or centrist, there is a home for you here, particularly as we fight Brexit together,” he said. Despite the difficulties that any new party would face, talk of such a move has not gone away. Some Labour MPs have privately said they will look again at the idea once Brexit has happened in the spring. Asked to imagine that a new centre-ground party formed tomorrow, two in five voters said that they would be likely to vote for it in a future general election.

May lead over Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister has increased from last month, rising from six points to nine points.

44,"The full extent of senior Liberal Democrats’ exasperation with their former leader Tim Farron handling of questions about homosexuality and abortion will be revealed in a book about last year general election. Philip Cowley and Denis Kavanagh The British General Election of the latest in a long-running series, will be published by Palgrave Macmillan on September. It details the meltdown at Lib Dem HQ when a campaign the party had hoped would be about blocking Brexit became increasingly hijacked by the personal views of Farron, a Christian with conservative beliefs who resigned after the campaign , saying he had struggled to reconcile politics with “remaining faithful to Christ”. As the Lib Dems prepare to gather for their annual conference, extracts released to the Guardian recall Farron clashing with advisers over the issue of abortion, as they prepped him for a televised debate. “Farron was asked a question about whether abortion was morally wrong, at which point he started to equivocate. The former [Nick] Clegg adviser James McGrory was playing [ former Ukip leader ] Paul Nuttall (he had a great time and made a much more effective Paul Nuttall than the real Paul Nuttall), but at this point he broke out of character and exploded: ‘For fuck sake, you just say no – it not fucking wrong.’” On homosexuality, advisers repeatedly attempted to “come up with forms of words that he would be willing to say and which would resolve the issue”, Cowley and Kavanagh write, “only for Farron to change his mind,” usually after attending his evangelical church. “He’d travel back to [his constituency] Westmorland, where things were not going well, and he’d go to church and he’d realise how much they mattered to him, and how much it mattered to them, and he’d come back down to London on Monday and everything we thought we’d agreed would have unravelled,” one tells the authors. Farron had had high hopes that Labour decision to accept the result of the Brexit referendum, after which Jeremy Corbyn whipped his MPs to back article would allow the Lib Dems to surge ahead in the polls – and perhaps even to “do a Trudeau” and leapfrog the opposition. But by the closing stage of the campaign, at focus groups carried out with putative Lib Dem voters, “the only thing that got mentioned was homosexuality”, one of those who organised the groups told Cowley and Kavanagh. “People said: ‘That doesn’t sound very libera,’ and you wanted to scream.” On Brexit, the issue that had helped the Lib Dems to defeat the Tories in the London constituency of Richmond Park just six months earlier, “the door had closed”. The responses Lib Dem campaigners were recording from voters on doorsteps in the final stage of the campaign were indicating they were at risk of losing the leader own seat. Those calculations resulted in an experienced organiser transferred from his predecessor Clegg Sheffield Hallam constituency to Farron Lake District patch to help out on polling day. In the end, it was the former deputy prime minister seat that was lost . Concerns about whether Westmoreland and Lonsdale could be at risk also complicated the travel arrangements for the party bright yellow battle bus, the book reveals. “Farron believed that one reason he was doing badly locally was that local voters saw him as having deserted them to go and be a big-name politician in London. He therefore did not want to be seen in the campaign bus going into or out of the constituency, so the party had to arrange for the bus to stop outside the constituency boundary, at which point he was transferred into a car, complicating an already tortuous set of travel arrangements.” Ultimately, the Lib Dems ended up with MPs – just two more than at the start of the year; though they gained some constituencies, including Vince Cable in Twickenham. Cable, who took over the leadership from Farron unopposed, is expected to step down before the next general election.",666,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/15/tim-farron-hijacked-lib-dems-with-his-beliefs-book-claims
45,"MPs are to push forward plans to give new mothers and fathers the right to nominate a party colleague to vote on their behalf in parliament. The Labour MP Harriet Harman said she expected a backbench business debate in October, where MPs could vote on plans for MPs to be able to register a proxy vote when they are absent with a newborn. Harman said the House of Commons was changing for the better, with a new demographic of young female MPs who wanted to have a family as well as a political career, which required a change in the rules. Currently MPs can only vote in person, or are registered as absent. The proposal has cross-party backing, including from Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, Conservative select committee chair Maria Miller and the SNP Hannah Bardell. Swinson, who has recently had her second child, was at the centre of the row during the summer during a tight Brexit vote where the Conservative chair Brandon Lewis broke a so-called pairing agreement , where rival parties agree to have MPs abstain in order to cancel out opposition MPs who are ill, new parents or unavoidably absent. MPs will have a general debate on the issue of proxy voting in parliament on Thursday and a government motion on parental leave is also expected, with the backing of Andrea Leadsom , the leader of the House of Commons. A government source said they were hoping to secure Downing Street support for the change, but said it would come down to timetabling as to whether Leadsom or Harman proposal was put before MPs first. Harman said she expected that MPs would be able to vote on her motion, based on recommendations from a report by the Commons procedure committee, at a backbench business debate in October. MPs have said it is vital the issue is resolved swiftly, given the number of MPs who are new parents or expecting. Labour has three MPs who are pregnant or on maternity leave – Laura Pidcock, Cat Smith and Holly Lynch – and the Conservative MPs Andrea Jenkyns and Chloe Smith have recently given birth. Emma Reynolds, the Labour MP who gave birth four days before the election last year, said the pairing system was “not fit for purpose” and meant new mothers could be vulnerable to allegations of laziness if their voting record appeared to be poor. “Last year, a national newspaper accused me of having the second-worst voting record in parliament without referring to the fact I was on maternity leave,” she said. “One of my other colleagues in a similar situation was branded one of ‘Britain laziest MPs’. New mums shouldn’t have to face this reputational damage. “I hope that these proposals for proxy voting will go through quickly so that MPs can continue to represent their constituents while they are on maternity leave, paternity leave or shared parental leave. “Passing these reforms would send out an important signal to young women and men who are considering a career as an MP and who would also like to start a family.”",516,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/12/mps-to-propose-allowing-proxy-votes-for-members-absent-for-family-reasons
46,"Labour faced widespread criticism for its delay in adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, but where do the other main parties stand? In July the Conservative party claimed it had adopted the definition in full, but at the time its code of conduct made no mention of antisemitism . The code stated that discrimination on the basis of “religion or belief” constituted a breach of the party rules but did not specify a definition of antisemitism, despite Theresa May saying all political parties should adopt the full IHRA definition. Since then the Tory party code has been amended to include an interpretive annexe on discrimination, which does refer to the IHRA definition. It now says: Discrimination includes victimising or harassing any other person because of race (including colour, ethnic or national origin, nationality, citizenship), sex, gender re-assignment, sexual orientation, marital or civil partnership status, disability, age, religion or belief [which should be interpreted as fully adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism], pregnancy and maternity status. The Liberal Democrats formally adopted the IHRA definition in full this week with the worked examples. A spokesman said: Liberal Democrats are committed to fighting bigotry and prejudice in all its forms. The federal board of the Liberal Democrats has officially re-confirmed the party adoption of the International Holocaust Memorial Alliance definition of antisemitism in full, with its worked examples. It has been used by the party to handle complaints and disciplinary processes since Jonathan Fryer, chair of Liberal Democrat Friends of Palestine, told Jewish News: “LDFP is firmly opposed to antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination. However, in common with several Liberal Jewish groups, as well as legal opinions from a number of authorities (as well as the author of the definition himself), we do have reservations about the wisdom of adopting the IHRA definition with its examples, because of its implications for freedom of expression.” Hodge urges Corbyn to rebuild trust after Labour antisemitism row A spokesman for the SNP pointed out that the SNP-led Scottish government had adopted the definition in June , but has yet to clarify whether the party itself has also adopted it. The Green party ruling body has discussed adopting the IHRA as part of an internal review but has so far decided against. A spokesman said: The Green party is opposed to racism in all its forms, and that includes antisemitism and Islamophobia. We are currently updating and reviewing our own internal policies, to ensure that they represent our opposition to, and tackling of, all forms of racism and prejudice, wherever they exist and by whomever they are perpetrated.

47,"The Greens’ new leadership duo of Jonathan Bartley and Siân Berry have promised the party will make a stand against “vapid centrism” in UK politics, making it clear that they consider Jeremy Corbyn Labour part of this tame establishment. Bartley and Berry were strong favourites throughout the campaign to choose the party leadership in England and Wales, and won almost of the votes cast. They take over from the previous pairing of Bartley and Caroline Lucas . The Greens have been badly squeezed in recent years, seeing their vote share more than halve between the and elections, something put down in part to Corbyn approach with Labour. But the new leaders told the Guardian they wanted to counter the idea that Corbyn had moved into their territory, with Berry highlighting what she said was Labour equivocation over areas such as Brexit and migration. “It not tame – it a betrayal. They’ve utterly fudged those issues,” she said. Bartley said: “There handwringing over Brexit. They’ve fudged Heathrow and airport expansion, Hinckley and nuclear power. They aren’t committed to proportional representation. The Labour manifesto had no real wealth redistribution in there. There was income redistribution, but they’re not tackling the elephant in the room of wealth distribution. “There still this commitment to credit-fuelled growth across the every sector of the economy. There subsidies for fossil fuels, subsidies for the commercial arms trade. This is a social democratic party. It not the radical alternative the country needs.” In May, Lucas said she would not stand again with the aim of “making space for other people”, while pledging to remain a Green MP. Bartley, leader of the Green opposition on Lambeth council in south London, then joined forces with Berry, also a London councillor, in Camden, and a member of the London assembly. The other two candidates were both standing alone: Shahrar Ali, an academic and former deputy leader; and Leslie Rowe, who stood for parliament for the Greens in Richmond, Yorkshire, in and The party elects its full leadership team every two years. Lucas, the Greens’ sole MP and best-known figure, spent two years as joint leader with Bartley. Berry and Bartley say they hope to raise the profile of Green politicians across the country, such as the new Green lord mayors of Sheffield and Bristol, Magid Magid and Cleo Lake, and councillors newly elected in May local polls. Berry said: “In the last couple of years we’ve really demonstrated the role we have in being that voice for communities, of opposition.” The parallel vote for deputy leader saw the incumbent, Amelia Womack, voted in again. Among Womack opponents was Aimee Challenor, a activist from Coventry who served as the Greens’ equality spokeswoman, and was seeking to become the first trans person to take the role. However, Challenor quit the race and has since left the party following the conviction last month of her father, David – who was also her election agent – for torturing and raping a child at the family home. One of the most pressing tasks facing Bartley and Berry is to oversee an independent inquiry into safeguarding lessons from the case, notably why the party took no action against David Challenor for months after he was charged with the offences, for which he was jailed for years. His first court appearance over the allegations took place in November But before the trial, which began in August this year, he acted twice as his daughter election agent, at the general election and in May local polls. During this period he was allowed to remain active in the party, even though the Coventry Pride charity, for which he had volunteered, barred him after the first court appearance. As well as the inquiry into the case, due to report in November, the new leaders are awaiting the result of a previously-established review into the Greens’ organisational structures. Bartley said: “Our platform was very clear when we stood – that we want to professionalise the party.” Bartley and Berry must also seek to reinvigorate it.",673,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/jonathan-bartley-sian-berry-win-green-party-leadership-race
48,"Benedict Birnberg roseate view of Jeremy Corbyn attempts to grapple with Israel-Palestine relations ( Letters , August) as coloured by the harmonious relationship Birnberg forebears enjoyed with their Arab neighbours is understandable, but naive. One of the (many) vivid accounts that remain with me after years of working with a charity trying to give a voice to survivors of torture is that of a Rwandan Tutsi woman whose family members were massacred in front of her by the Interahamwe. It&nbsp;was her Hutu neighbours who led the militia to the front door – people with whom relations had been cordial, indeed friendly, until Hutu extremists seized power. Her father had even driven the mother of the house to hospital when she was in labour. Many Israeli policies are abhorrent, not least the continuous building of settlements after the Middle East peace conference in Madrid which scuppered any real chance of a subsequent deal. Such activities, however, are more than eclipsed by the existential threat – frequently voiced – that Israel faces from other countries in the region it shares. The succour that Corbyn has offered to those intent on cloaking such a threat with a respectable face is evidence of a gullibility that is beginning to bite. Andrew Hogg Chichester, West Sussex I consider my Green party to be the most principled UK political party in its opposition to racism, antisemitism and Islamophobia. However, in terms of wider social influence, I acknowledge that it is the Labour party that, despite some flaws, is the most powerful political force against all forms of discrimination in Britain. As a member of the Sikh community, with its long history of suffering persecution over the centuries under various regimes, I have natural sympathy with the Jewish people who have similarly suffered. Both these communities constitute two of the world small religions in comparison with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. With these feelings of solidarity with the Jewish community, I have observed with some sadness that some leading members of the Jewish community have been carrying on an unrelenting campaign against Jeremy Corbyn . No leader is flawless but trying to weaken him and consequently the Labour party at this juncture is a major error from the perspective of building a fairer society in Britain. It&nbsp;is not in the interests of the Labour party, either, to prolong the conflict with the Jewish community. If a well-intentioned dialogue can resolve the vexed question of justified criticism of Israeli state policies towards Palestinians not being considered as antisemitic, that should be done urgently to strengthen the much-needed political front against racism and bigotry. Pritam Singh Professor of economics, Oxford&nbsp;Brookes University The agenda of Margaret Hodge and no doubt others is clearly to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader ( Antisemitism row: Hodge and Brown pile pressure on Corbyn , September), something they have tried and failed to do twice so far. However, as Matthew d’Ancona underlines ( A new centre party would be a coalition of losers , September), even should they be successful what exactly is their political platform for winning an election? Simply repeating the New Labour politics of certainly won’t do it. Keith Flett London There is a plurality of Jewish opinion about antisemitism in the Labour party, both here and in Israel itself. In this critical week of decision-making for the Labour party, we should pay careful attention to a freedom of information request submitted by a group of respected Israeli lawyers, human rights activists and academics regarding the involvement of the Israeli ministries of strategic and foreign affairs in stoking the antisemitism row as part of a wider campaign to undermine Palestinian solidarity activists (see ). Evidence is mounting that they have a strong case. But so far no British newspaper has been courageous or disinterested enough to investigate. Nicola Grove Horningsham, Wiltshire It seems inevitable that Labour will have to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, as well as take action against antisemitic words and deeds within the party. Perhaps in the interests of balance, when Labour national executive committee meets, they could also consider adopting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement objectives of promoting a boycott of Israel until it meets its obligations under international law, as these objectives are not antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Richard Cooper Chichester, West Sussex Which part of the soul of his Labour party is Gordon Brown nostalgic for ? Invading Iraq? Helping the US with extraordinary rendition to facilitate torture? Grotesquely expensive PFI deals to build schools that are now falling down? Creeping privatisation of public services? Labour ministers sucking up to dubious foreign billionaires? The soulless vacuity of the Blair-Brown years is exactly what Jeremy Corbyn was elected to put an end to and I for one hope he succeeds, despite the best efforts of rightwing Labour MPs intent on dragging the party back to the shabby compromises of the Blair years. Tim Rossiter Crickhowell, Powys When Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said on BBC Radio that the majority of British Jews are Zionists and that when Jeremy Corbyn used the word Zionist it was code and meant Jewish people, is it not time for all to sign up to an agreed definition of the word Zionist? Jackie Fearnley Goathland, North Yorkshire While many vested interests are distracting us from what is happening to Palestinians by blaming Jeremy Corbyn for antisemitism, could someone tell me whether all other British political parties, including the Conservatives, have accepted the IHRA definition of antisemitism?

50,"The Green party has announced an inquiry into how the father of a candidate for the party deputy leadership was allowed to remain her election agent months after he was charged with raping and torturing a child, offences that led to him being jailed last week. The party said Aimee Challenor, who has insisted she did not know the full details of the allegations against her father, David, had been suspended pending the results of the independent investigation. The suspension was on a no-fault basis, the Greens said in a statement, promising also that the inquiry, the format of which will be announced later on Friday, would seek any “difficult lessons” about safeguarding. Several Green members have expressed alarm after it emerged that officials took no action to suspend David Challenor or restrict his activities in the party until he was jailed for years for torturing and raping a girl in the attic of the family home in Coventry. David Challenor first court appearance over the allegations took place in November But ahead of his trial, which began this month, he acted twice as his daughter election agent, at the general election, and in May local polls. I look to a future in which Aimee Challenor being trans doesn’t matter | Caroline Lucas During this period he was allowed to remain active in the party, even though the Coventry Pride group, for whom he had volunteered, barred him following the first court appearance. Aimee Challenor, who was made the party equalities spokeswoman last year, was standing to be the party new deputy leader. She withdrew from the race at the weekend following her father conviction. One party figure said they were “agonised, horrified and furious” at the apparent safeguarding failure, and hoped the Greens, a party that remains heavily localised and largely dependent on volunteers, would learn lessons from this. A Greens spokeswoman said: “Aimee Challenor has today been suspended on a no-fault basis from the Green party of England and Wales, following consideration by the relevant internal bodies of a number of complaints that have been made against her. “An investigation will be conducted by an external agency into the circumstances and disclosures surrounding Aimee father being able to act as her election agent, while facing charges for serious sexual assault against a minor.” The spokeswoman added: “The Green party takes its safeguarding responsibilities and duties of care extremely seriously and is committed to learning any difficult lessons needed.” Aimee Challenor, a trans woman who has campaigned particularly on LGBT issues, has said she was horrified by her father crimes and “only learned the full details of them very recently, despite living at the family home”. The Green party, which reselects its top lineup every two years, is choosing replacements for the leadership team of Caroline Lucas, the party sole MP, and Jonathan Bartley. With Lucas opting to step back from the leadership, Bartley is standing on a joint ticket with Siân Berry, a councillor in Camden, north London, and a member of the London assembly.

51,"A rising young member of the Greens has pulled out of the race to become the party deputy leader after her father, who was previously her election agent, was jailed for abusing and raping a child. Aimee Challenor, the Greens’ equalities spokeswoman , who was among the frontrunners in the leadership contest, said she had had no idea about the crimes, but was withdrawing to prevent the election process becoming “dominated by what my father has done”. David Challenor, was jailed for years last week after being convicted of torturing and raping a girl in the attic of the family home in Coventry. He had served as Aimee Challenor election agent when she stood in the general election and in the local elections in May this year – after his arrest. In a statement announcing her withdrawal from the deputy leadership contest the said she was horrified and saddened by her father crimes, and only learned the full details of them very recently, despite living at the family home. “That might be hard for you to understand, or to believe, but it is the truth,” she said. “I was taken into care a few years ago and have also lived in independent supported housing. There were sustained periods where I did not live in the family home.” She added: “Yes, he was my election agent. This was one of a number of ways I was seeking to reconcile my relationship with my father after coming out of care. On reflection, I can understand that it was unacceptable for me to appoint my dad as my election agent when he had been arrested.” Aimee Challenor joined the Greens in and became the party equalities spokeswoman a year later, with a particular focus on LGBT issues – she is a trans woman. In a statement, the Greens said the party had not been told anything about David Challenor arrest or charges during the nomination processes, and that it was urgently reviewing its disclosure and safeguarding policies. It added: “We apologise unreservedly that Mr Challenor was able to act as an election agent for Aimee Challenor in the general election and the local elections in May this year despite the nature of the charges brought against him. “A full investigation into how this was able to happen is taking place.

52,"Britain political landscape has already been reshaped irrevocably by the Brexit vote. But there is a growing feeling at Westminster that the deep divisions over whether, and how, Britain should break from the EU, cannot be contained within the existing party system. Only Jeremy Corbyn Labour can reimagine an EU that works for everyone | Hilary Wainwright Within Labour in particular, turmoil from the party handling of antisemitism has also tested the loyalty of MPs, some of whom were already sceptical of Jeremy Corbyn leadership , and want to see him take a more strident anti-Brexit position. When Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Labour biggest union backer, Unite, unleashed a strongly worded attack against Chuka Umunna last week, he was reflecting concern that Corbyn leadership could be destabilised by even a relatively small number of high-profile defections. One senior party figure suggested Corbyn core team, hardened by the “chicken coup” that followed the EU referendum in were eliding several separate but related threats. The fear that the leadership was under attack again was leading to conflation, the source said. MPs ask for expenses budgets to be raised to cover Brexit costs Separate possibilities exist but are not necessarily directly related. Firstly, a number of Jewish MPs seriously considered resigning the whip over the party handling of antisemitism before the summer, and the resurgence of the issue has made that threat salient once more. “There are MPs who are being pushed to the absolute limit,” said one. Several suggested that had the party followed through with the idea of disciplining the MP Margaret Hodge, who had faced a formal inquiry for calling Corbyn an antisemite, that would have been the breaking point. The party later dropped action against Hodge. Secondly, but separately, a group of centrist MPs, including Umunna and fellow Labour MP Chris Leslie, are widely believed to be laying the groundwork for the creation of a new party although both have denied this. Brexit: Tory MPs warn of entryism threat from Leave. EU supporters Thirdly, Simon Franks, the millionaire co-founder of the film rental business LoveFilm, is preparing to launch a centrist, anti-politics party , United for Change, perhaps as soon as next month. “Franks wants to be the new Emmanuel Macron,” said one person with knowledge of the project, believed to have a budget. United for Change is not believed to have any big name politicians on board yet. McCluskey attack on those mulling the possibility of a new party was echoed on social media by other vocal supporters of the Labour leadership, known as “blue tick Corbynistas” by those on the right of the party, and by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. In a tweet apparently directed at Umunna, McDonnell said: Despite the anxieties of the leadership, next spring, after the end of March date set for Brexit, is deemed by centrist MPs to be the most auspicious moment for launching a new party. “There a very strong feeling that it must not be a distraction from our goal to stop Brexit, just at the moment” when stopping the UK leaving the EU may be possible , said one MP. One former remain campaign source said: “The intention is real and serious but it is unlikely before Brexit. The argument will be that the country needs a new political force to bring it together post-Brexit. “But I would guess the real incentive for any MP to jump … will be a threat of deselection. And that is why a lot of people are watching carefully to see if anything comes of the local attempts to deselect Kate Hoey or Frank Field.” Leslie, the MP for Nottingham East, is widely viewed as being at risk of deselection. He used a brief stint as shadow chancellor in to argue that Labour had lost the general election partly because its economic policies were too leftwing, and has since been a trenchant critic of Corbyn leadership. In June, he published a wide-ranging policy paper, called Centre Ground, under the auspices of the Social Market Foundation thinktank. Many saw the document as laying the intellectual groundwork for a future new party. Chapter headings included, “evidence not ideology”; and “representative democracy not populism”. But Labour is not the only party being pulled in at least two directions by Brexit, with hardline Tory backbenchers mobilising to force Theresa May to ditch her Chequers deal. “I don’t see how my party can survive. I really don’t,” said one Conservative MP. Some of the party centre-right have begun reaching out more regularly. George Freeman, the MP for Mid Norfolk, has invited senior Tory, Liberal Democrat and Labour figures to attend his Big Tent Ideas festival next month, co-hosted by the peer Sally Morgan, a former aide to Tony Blair. Labour MPs scheduled to attend include Harriet Harman, Liam Byrne and Peter Kyle. Freeman has denied that the festival is in any way linked to plans to form a new centre party, but he set tongues wagging after inviting Emmanuel Macron to address the event. The French president won office after creating a new centrist movement, La République En Marche. The final piece of the puzzle is the question of the Lib Dems, the original centrist, alternative party that is still struggling in the polls. The party is “ripe for entryism, which we’re not totally against”, one source said. The Lib Dems are pinning their hopes for revival on some radical reforms to be presented at party conference in September. These include measures to widen its membership, to allow supporters as well as members to vote in leadership elections and to change its leadership rules to allow non-MPs to stand as party leader.",946,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/20/prospect-new-uk-party-grows-westminster-political-cracks-brexit
53,"More than MPs have called for far-reaching changes to the UK electoral system, which was described as unfit for purpose and in dire need of reform after the official Brexit campaign was fined for breaking campaign rules. Stephen Kinnock , whose letter to the speaker, John Bercow, was signed by Labour, Lib Dem and Green MPs, said the existing fines were an insufficient deterrent and were regarded as “simply as the cost of doing business”. Vote Leave fined and reported to police by Electoral Commission In the letter, the Labour MP for Aberavon said the Electoral Commission had sought stronger powers for many years and, given the rapid technological advancements in recent years, was an “analogue regulator in a digital age”. “The government must act immediately otherwise abuse will continue and trust will decline. More dark money and dark data will flood the system and buy influence,” he said. “[The Electoral Commission] fines are laughable and seen simply as the cost of doing business.” Other signatories included Caroline Lucas, David Lammy, Vince Cable and Stella Creasy. The letter recommended four reforms to help prevent future electoral abuse: Hand the EC powers of investigation and prosecution to police and remove limits to fines. Require campaigns to report expenditure online in a similar way to MPs’ expenses. Prohibit transfers from a designated campaign to satellite campaigns. Regulate, or possibly pause, paid political advertising during an election period. Without reform, the signatories said, “our democracy and elections will remain vulnerable to tampering and manipulation”. On Tuesday, Vote Leave was fined after the Electoral Commission found significant evidence of coordination with BeLeave, another pro-Brexit group. The watchdog said it had found evidence BeLeave coordinated with Vote Leave and spent more than with the digital data company Aggregate IQ. Vote Leave also exceeded its legal spending limit of by almost Darren Grimes, the founder of BeLeave, and the Vote Leave official David Halsall were reported to the police. Grimes was fined The action came after Leave.EU was fined with its chief executive, Liz Bilney, referred to the police in May over its spending. The latest findings stoked calls from MPs, campaigners and the public for a rerun of the EU referendum, while fears remain about outside interference during the vote. In the letter, MPs also called for campaigns to be made to declare their spending on digital platforms. They also echoed calls from the commission itself for the need for more stringent regulations on digital political advertising, which has led to the anomaly of attack ads being allowed online but not on TV. “Until these reforms are instituted, our democracy will remain susceptible to future abuses like these,” the group said. “Looking ahead, we cannot in good conscience have another election or referendum without ensuring our polls are free and fair.” The Electoral Commission, which has said it needs greater resources to better regulate online political campaigning, welcomed support from MPs for greater powers. “We have been calling for parliament to make changes for over a decade and most recently set these out in detail in our digital campaigning report,” a spokesperson said. “With the increasing use of online and targeted digital communications, action must be taken by the UK governments and parliaments, and by social media companies, to improve transparency for voters.” It called for a change in the law so that online campaigning materials would be forced to bear an imprint stating who created them. “We also continue to call for higher sanctioning powers in order to provide an effective deterrent, and counter the risk that well-funded campaigners will come to see our current fines as the cost of doing business,” the spokesperson added.",611,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/21/mps-call-for-changes-electoral-system-vote-leave

Lucas, the party sole MP and best-known figure, has spent two years as joint leader with Bartley, a councillor in Lambeth, south London. In May, Lucas said she would not stand again with the aim of “making space for other people”. Bartley announced he would instead stand with Berry. She is also a London councillor, in Camden, and is a member of the London assembly. Their competition for the members vote, which runs from July to August, will primarily come from Shahrar Ali, an academic and former deputy leader of the Greens, who is well known within the party. Leftwingers launch pro-EU campaign to shift Labour position on Brexit The final contender for the role, which covers the Greens in England and Wales, is Leslie Rowe, who stood as the party candidate in Richmond, Yorkshire, in and Lucas, the MP for Brighton Pavilion since became the Greens’ first leader in after the party dropped its system of two “principal speakers”. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett in Bennett endured a difficult general election , after which Lucas and Bartley took over. When Lucas and Bartley were elected joint leaders there was some scepticism as to how such an arrangement might work, but the pair say it has proved a success. The Greens re-elect their leader, deputy leader and seven other senior posts every two years. Three other positions are elected on one-year terms. The results will be announced at the party annual conference in October. Among the five candidates for deputy leader are Amelia Womack, who has filled the role for four years, and Aimee Challenor , a activist from Coventry who is the Greens’ equality spokeswoman.

All full members are eligible to vote, using a single transferable vote system. In comments released to coincide with the announcement, Lucas said she was “excited to see such a wide range of candidates” to build on the work she and Bartley have done. “Britain needs a strong Green voice now more than ever,” she said. “On issues from Brexit, to rising inequality and the government reckless attitude to our environmental protections and climate targets, Greens will always speak truth to power. “I will still be doing that in Parliament, and I look forward to seeing ever more Greens joining the national debate.”",476,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/02/greens-announce-three-sets-of-contenders-for-uk-leadership-contest
55,"agid Magid was in his local Sainsbury recently when a shopper asked him to pose for a picture by squatting. The cheerfully obliged, crouching on the supermarket floor “with a loaf of bread in my hand”. Today, our photoshoot takes for ever, because as soon as we leave the town hall he keeps being stopped in the street. But his fame extends far beyond his home town of Sheffield . A Jordanian friend told him his mum had seen him on the news in Amman. “I’m like: ‘What the heck?’ I didn’t expect this much attention,” he says. Magid has become a global celebrity since being elected lord mayor of Sheffield in May . His elevation was reported as good news all over the planet and when we meet in his office – the lord mayor parlour, to be precise – he can’t stop smiling. But, in fact, his appointment was not celebrated with universally excited fandom at first. “You’re a disgrace to this city,” people shouted at him from passing cars. “I am disappointed that Magid has seen fit to tell everyone that he is a black, Muslim immigrant,” complained a letter to the local press. Another resident wrote of his appointment: “It an insult to the people of Sheffield ... There must be many Sheffield-born people who are worthy of being the mayor. What has Sheffield finally come to?” There were complaints about his choice of music for his inauguration ceremony – the Imperial March from Star Wars – and Magid pulls out a copy of a local paper from his desk drawer to show me “the most ridiculous” letter, which lamented: “We are losing our identity.” How did he feel about the criticism? “Do you know what, it was a small minority. But it felt large, because it was all I was hearing.” Did it make him wobbly? “Yes,” he admits. “Yes, of course. I’m human.” What changed everything was a single photoshoot. Every lord mayor appointment since the century has been commemorated by an official portrait. “So I said to myself: that picture going to outlive me well past when I’m dead. I wanted a picture that encapsulated me, because I always think a picture should tell. Because look at all of them” – he gestures around the parlour to solemn faces lining the flock-wallpapered walls. “It just a boring headshot. It would have been so good if every lord mayor had the opportunity to be creative with their picture, to tell their story.” Wearing his official gold livery collar and black Dr Martens boots , he posed by squatting on the marble bannister plinth of the town hall stairs. “I shouldn’t have done that, because it health and safety, but nobody was looking,” he grins. In other pictures, he wore a bright-yellow baseball cap turned back to front, his chains over a jumper. “Then people were like: ‘You’re disrespecting the town hall, disrespecting our traditions.’ That all I was hearing.” But when the images were posted on social media, they went viral. Messages from all over the world began “blowing up my inbox. And then I’m like: wow. I’m doing the right thing.” He beams. “And the only reason we’re here today – the only reason we got so much attention – is because I decided to be myself; because – I know it sounds a bit cliche – I did things my way and [did] what I believe in. Had I stuck to the norms, the traditions, I don’t think you’d be here today from the Guardian. So now, do you know what, I wake up in the morning and I think: ‘I couldn’t give a fuck today, I couldn’t give a shit,’ I’m just going to do what I want to do. Of course, I’ve had a lot of stick. But I don’t care.” Magid didn’t even tell his mother or his sister he was going to become lord mayor until his appointment was announced. The ceremonial position lasts for one year and rotates between the parties represented on the council; of his predecessors, the youngest had been and none had been a Green. His party colleagues nominated him because, as one said: “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t like him.” This is easy to believe, for he could not be more charming. Magid was five when he fled Somalia with his mother and elder sister. They spent six months in Ethiopia before arriving in Sheffield, where life wasn’t easy. His mother supported the family by working as a cleaner, but she struggled to learn English and Magid grew accustomed to seeing her being racially abused in the street. His teenage years were troubled and for a while he was a gang member. I ask him to be specific about his adolescent misdemeanours, but he grows uncharacteristically coy. “It was just a case of being mischievous.” Was he ever arrested? “Have I ever been arrested?” he repeats slowly. “I think I might take a pass on that question.” You could be the most racist person to me​; I will still open that door for you. You can’t solve hate with hate He was rescued by, of all things, a love of travel brochures. After raising money to climb Kilimanjaro, he studied aquatic zoology at the University of Hull, where he founded a mixed martial arts club and was elected to the students’ union sports executive. He had never voted when he stood for president of the union; he didn’t even know what a picket line was. “I think the only reason I got elected, with a big majority, was because I think people could just relate.” After graduating, he became a digital marketing consultant and stood successfully as a Green party council candidate in “because the people on the council just didn’t reflect its electorate”. Unlike most elected politicians, Magid lives in a shared house with three people he had not met before moving in. His day begins not with the Today programme , but with YouTube – “I’ve got a big TV in my bedroom, so I just stick that on” – and he is still trying to get used to the chauffeur who pulls up outside his house in a Jaguar to take him to work; he won’t let him open the car door. “It like protocol, apparently,” he marvels, laughing. “But it a bit ridiculous.” In one sense, he identifies with the new generation of political outsiders who have been winning office all over the world. “It a symptom that our democracy is not working properly.” He corrects himself: “No, it not working at all. It definitely not reflective, not just of people of colour, disabled people, of women, but of any of us, really. We’ve got a cabinet of millionaires in this country, probably of them went to private school [the figure is actually and they make decisions for the rest of the country.” However, despite having starred in reality TV earlier this year – on the third series of Channel fugitive show Hunted – he takes great exception to any suggestion of parallels with Donald Trump. “That doesn’t sit with me very well, it really doesn’t. He is part of the establishment. He got given [as a loan by his father] when he was a kid. He doesn’t represent the people. It just a complete con.” When Trump visits the UK in July, “I’ll definitely be protesting. Definitely.” But if Trump is a great disruptor, Magid plans for Sheffield come under the same category. Every month, he will invite a member of the city creative community to showcase their talents at the council meeting. “Call if a half-time show, call it what you want.” The first, in June, was a scientist called Hassun El Zafar , who performed magic tricks. “There was a water rocket launched across the chamber and he talked about how science is a creative art in itself. It was amazing.” Magid wore a black T-shirt to the meeting, bearing the slogan “Immigrants Make Britain Great”, and a tartan beret. What did the councillors make of it all? “They were a bit hesitant and whatnot at first – but then they came around to it and they were laughing and then they all loved it.” He also invited the letter-writers who condemned his appointment in the local press to a round-table meeting, because “I believe we should be having uncomfortable conversations, rather than sweeping things under the carpet”. The man who had complained that the city people were “losing their identity” didn’t show up. “But others did and they came around to it at the end of the day.” Really? “Yes, genuinely, they did.” Magid strikes me as unusually untroubled by self-doubt. He agrees. He is well aware of some hostility on the council towards him and his ideas, but he says it is concentrated in one party, which he won’t name. His plan is to “kill it with kindness and bury it with a smile. You could be the most racist person to me; I will still open that door for you. You can’t solve hate with hate. That doesn’t solve anything whatsoever. I will still be kind to you, because at the end of the day you’re human; we all go through the same problems, same issues, face the same things, and I believe people can come around just by meeting people. I treat people with kindness, because arguing doesn’t solve anything.” He knows there are people who are waiting for him to mess up – massively” – and he is sure he will, sooner or later. “I’m not perfect. I’m going to make mistakes.” (He is keen to correct reports, however, that he plans to “pimp” the lord mayor parlour at public expense: “There no way on earth I’m going to spend public money on refurbishments.”) But nothing can detract from the symbolism of his appointment. “It really easy for everybody to feel: ‘Oh, isn’t it amazing,’ but in reality my story is very unlikely, because of this government policies.” Were he five years old today, he points out, this government would not have allowed him and his family entry to the UK. He watched the plight of the refugee boat turned away by Italy recently with horror. “I feel disgusted, because had they been white Europeans I doubt very much they would have been sent away. If that had been white Europeans it would have been a different story.” I ask him about his political ambitions and he laughs. “Nobody joins the Greens to have a career in politics.” What about reality TV – does he have any plans to do more of that? He is single, but he looks appalled when I suggest Love Island; laughing again, he shakes his head. “No. And I don’t regret going on Hunted, but I would never do anything like that again. I hadn’t realised it would all be contrived; it wasn’t really real at all.” He pauses for a moment. “There is one show that seems genuine, though. And I love dancing. So, yeah, I wouldn’t do anything else – but I’d do Strictly.” Saturday interview Race issues Sheffield features",1867,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/22/magid-magid-sheffields-lord-mayor-ive-had-a-lot-of-stick-but-i-dont-care
56,"Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, is to stand again for the post on a joint ticket with London assembly member Siân Berry after his current co-leader, Caroline Lucas, said this week she was stepping down. The announcement by Bartley and Berry has made them frontrunners for the role, which is voted on by Green members every two years. Bartley and Lucas were elected as joint leaders in Lucas, by far the party best-known figure and its only MP since she was elected to represent Brighton Pavilion in , said on Wednesday “making space for other people” was the right thing to do. “We have a wonderful array of talent in the party and I would love the opportunity for more of that to be showcased,” Lucas said. Bartley, who was not well known before he stood with Lucas, is the leader of the Green opposition on Lambeth council in south London. Berry has a slightly higher profile, albeit largely in the capital. She is a Camden councillor and stood twice as the Greens’ candidate for London mayor. Lucas became the Greens’ first leader in after the party dropped its system of two “principal speakers”. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett in Bennett endured a difficult general election, after which Lucas and Bartley took over. When Lucas and Bartley were elected joint leaders there was some scepticism as to how such an arrangement might work, but the pair say it has proved a success. Nominations for the leadership remain open this month and the winner will be announced at the party conference in October. Bartley said the Greens were “firmly established as England fourth party”. He said: “I want to continue that work with Siân as we build towards the next vital set of elections. “Our ambition is to have a Green on every council and together we believe the time is right for the party to step up to a whole new level.” Berry said that although Lucas was a hard act to follow, she was committed to growing the party support.",347,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/01/jonathan-bartley-sian-berry-green-party-co-leaders-caroline-lucas
57,"Ukip faces “utter marginalisation” if it continues along its current hard-right direction, Nigel Farage has said, as the party he formerly led opened its annual conference with a range of new policies targeting Muslims and equalities laws. Further shift to right by Ukip may prompt party exodus, say insiders Farage, who stepped down as Ukip leader after the EU referendum in criticised the current leader, Gerard Batten, for seeking to bring in Tommy Robinson , the far-right anti-Muslim activist and founder of the English Defence League. Farage said it “really upsets” him that Ukip, which began its two-day conference in Birmingham on Friday, was even considering allowing entry to Robinson, the political stage name of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. “I’m less than impressed with the current direction in which we’re going,” Farage told the Press Association. “It devalues, undermines many of the incredible achievements.” Farage said Ukip was “in danger now unless it changes direction very, very quickly, of total and utter marginalisation”. Batten was to give his leader speech later on Friday, unveiling policy ideas that include Muslim-only prisons, special security screening for Muslim would-be immigrants and a repeal of equalities laws. Other policies put forward in an interim manifesto, which Batten said was aimed at making Ukip “a populist party in the real sense of the word”, include the abolition of the category of hate crime, as well as scrapping the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and the government equalities office. It also calls for a national inquiry into the abuse of children and women by sexual grooming gangs, something it calls “one of the greatest social scandals in English history”. Batten, speaking to Sky News ahead of the conference, denied he was taking the party to the far right, and said Farage was being hypocritical. “Nigel has gone to speak on platforms with Alternative für Deutschland, who a lot of people don’t like and call names,” he said. “He is entitled to do that, because they are democratic parties, and I am entitled to speak at rallies organised by people who believe in democracy. I think maybe he should be a little bit more careful about criticising me, because he has done similar things.” Batten said he wanted to see Robinson join the party, but this would not happen in the near future, as the party rules currently prevent former EDL members from joining. Batten is vehement in his opinions on Islam, having described the religion as “a death cult” . He reiterated his views to Sky, saying: “If you look at any country in the world where Islam is predominant, they are either very repressive regimes or they are regimes that are in conflict internally. I think that something we have to be very wary of.” However, in his speech at the conference Batten avoided the subject, instead focusing on Brexit, saying the party, currently polling at or could not be expected to win seats if there was an early general election but could “cause havoc” in marginal seats represented by remain-backing MPs. “We know where the remain MPs sit. We know where there are remain MPs in leave constituencies on narrow margins,” he said. “Remainers: we know where your constituencies are, and we are coming for you.” The new policy programme is likely to increase fears among more moderate Ukip members that he is seeking to create a nationalist, anti-Islam party. Two key themes are measures connected to what it described as “Islamic literalist and fundamentalist extremism”, and an emphasis on what the party called a threat to free speech “driven by the political doctrine of cultural Marxism”. On Islam, it has proposed combating militancy in prisons with segregated sections of jails, or even entire jails, reserved for Muslim prisoners “who promote extremism or try to convert non-Islamic prisoners”. As part of a wider crackdown on immigration, the manifesto suggests arrivals from Muslim countries should face a “security-based screening policy” to check their views. Ukip Gerard Batten reiterates his belief that Islam is a 'death cult' Policies also include scrapping the concept of hate crimes, whereby prejudice can be considered an aggravating factor in offences. In addition to abolishing equalities organisations and banning positive discrimination, Ukip would aim to get rid of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and the British Council. Other mooted policies include overseas nationals having to live in the UK for five years before buying homes, rail nationalisation, and the abolition of the Crown Prosecution Service, the Climate Change Act, the BBC licence fee, inheritance tax and stamp duty. Batten, who took over on a one-year interim term with a mission to stabilise a party that has floundered since Farage stood down, faces dissent from a number of insiders.

58,"Ukip has proposed Muslim-only prisons, special security screening for Muslim would-be immigrants and a repeal of equalities laws before its annual conference, further indicating the party shift to the populist hard right under its leader, Gerard Batten. The conference will be held from Friday. Other policies put forward in a so-called interim manifesto, which Batten said was aimed at making Ukip “a populist party in the real sense of the world”, include the abolition of the category of hate crime, as well as scrapping the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and the government equalities office. The document also calls for a national inquiry into the abuse of children and women by sexual grooming gangs, something it calls “one of the greatest social scandals in English history”. Batten, who took over the Ukip leadership from the beleaguered Henry Bolton in April, has allied himself with the far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson , who is the figurehead for an informal movement that uses grooming gangs as a means by which to campaign more widely against Islam in the UK. The Ukip manifesto says the activity of grooming gangs had been covered up for years due to “political correctness and the fear of identifying the vast majority of the perpetrators as Muslims”. Batten is vehement in his views on Islam, having described the religion as “a death cult” . His influence is clear in a policy programme that is likely to increase fears among more moderate Ukip members that he is seeking to create a nationalist, anti-Islam party.

As part of a wider crackdown on immigration, the manifesto suggests arrivals from Muslim countries should face a “security-based screening policy” to check their views. In the document introduction, Batten says Ukip was “determined to protect our freedom of speech and the right to speak our minds without fear of the politically correct thought police knocking on our doors”. Policies also include scrapping the concept of hate crimes, whereby prejudice can be considered an aggravating factor in offences. In addition to abolishing equalities organisations and banning positive discrimination, Ukip would aim to get rid of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the British Council. Other mooted policies include overseas nationals having to live in the UK for five years before buying homes, rail nationalisation, and the abolition of the Crown Prosecution Service, the Climate Change Act, the BBC licence fee, inheritance tax and stamp duty. The programme would be both populist and popular, Batten predicted, in its stance against establishment ideas such as “open-border uncontrolled immigration, and imposing an alien politically correct cultural agenda on their peoples”.

59,"he European parliament vast blue and grey chamber is half empty when Nigel Farage gets to his feet. It is a routine debate on the EU budget and MEPs are not scrimping on detail. They have spoken of frameworks, roadmaps and sustainable goals. But that is not the Farage way. Making a glancing reference to the “Brexit hole” in the EU budget, the former Ukip leader launches into an attack on Theresa May, who he says is “desperately scrambling” to get the UK into EU programmes, before segueing into a riff on Italy political crisis . A lone MEP, from Ukip, claps vigorously. The two-minute speech is everything the others are not: brisk, punchy and almost completely irrelevant to the debate. But Farage is not addressing the EU budget commissioner, his true audience are the tens of thousands who will watch later on their computers or phones. Within hours Farage speech has had more than views on Ukip YouTube channel, while barely people watched the debate on the EU broadcasting service. Disaffected members could leave Ukip if Gerard Batten stays leader, say insiders By Ukip standards, these are modest figures. Videos of Farage telling one EU leader he had the “ charisma of a damp rag ”, or his post-Brexit referendum declaration to MEPs that “ you are not laughing now ”, have had millions of views. But in March Farage monthly show in the European parliament will be switched off for good. The party MEPs will leave the European parliament, losing generous salaries , expenses and EU funding that has boosted party fortunes, while also triggering investigations into misspending . In Ukip declared an income of from members and donations in the UK, while Ukip-dominated groups in the European parliament received in EU funds, shared with other Eurosceptics. Farage has always understood the importance of European elections, describing them as the “lifeblood” of Ukip in a lecture at the London School of Economics . “Without the European elections, without getting three seats in without getting the resources that the European parliament made available to us ... without the letters ‘MEP’ after our names, Ukip would never have appeared on Question Time , or Any Questions or any of the major media programmes in this country.” Farage, who has the worst attendance record of all British MEPs, has been advancing his media career. “Talk radio is fun and it going to grow so I am going to enjoy that,” he told the Guardian. But following a disastrous performance in the local elections that resulted in a share of the vote, Ukip seems on the way to political irrelevance. In an attempt to look on the bright side, a senior party official compared the party with the Black Death . After going through four leaders in months, members are uneasy about the fifth: the London MEP Gerard Batten, who wants to move the party to a hard-right anti-Islam position . His march in support of the far-right English Defence League founder, Tommy Robinson, prompted one MEP, James Carver , to quit the party and sit as an independent. Batten approach has won support from some party veterans. John Stuart Agnew, one of Ukip longest-serving MEPs, says he would like to see the party confront what he calls “the problem of Islamification” and claims there is “a new political system coming in, something called sharia zones”. Agnew, a farmer, who represents the East of England, admits he has never seen a sharia zone, and bases his claim on a documentary he once saw, the name of which he cannot remember. While he thinks there is nothing inevitable about the party survival – “it depends on our policies” – he singles out immigration and the NHS as Ukip issues. “There is still not a proper handle on immigration. I know that leaving the EU will help that but there are still large numbers of people coming in.” Ukip has long been an unstable party, riven by in-fighting and scandal. Since seven MEPs have quit the party or the parliament, including the Diane James , the former leadership contender Steven Woolfe , who was hospitalised after an altercation with a Ukip MEP, and the former head of delegation Roger Helmer, who resigned as an MEP amid questions about the alleged misspending of in EU funds. Tories courted the Ukippers: now they’ll be consumed by them | Owen Jones The Labour MEP Richard Corbett thinks Ukip cannot survive on the same scale without EU support. “They have imploded as a party,” he says, noting it has also lost “substantial amounts of money”, after one MEP libelled and slandered Labour politicians. Corbett, who lost his seat to the BNP in , attributes Ukip rise and fall to its charismatic leader. “If Farage had been leader of the BNP, we would be talking about a BNP problem, instead of a Ukip problem.” Matthew Goodwin, a politics professor at Kent University, says it is too soon to write off Ukip or discount the emergence of a similar party able to mobilise the same voters. “Ukip has collapsed, but the last five years in British politics should warn all of us against assuming that there is no potential for populism going forward,” he said. If the final Brexit deal does not deal “meaningfully” with reform of free movement of people, which leave voters expect, “then Ukip or more likely a party like the UK Independence party will probably emerge on Britain political landscape”, says Goodwin. “If you are an average leave voter thinking that that leave vote gave you less immigration, you are likely to be very disappointed one, two, three years from now when you realise that what you got was not what you associated with Brexit, but something altogether different,” he says. “I think years from now, years from now, we may come back and look at this period as possibly a moment of calm before another storm.”",991,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/21/party-imploded-can-ukip-still-survive-brexit
60,"Large numbers of Ukip members could consider leaving the party if Gerard Batten makes further moves to reshape it as a hard-right populist movement at its annual conference in Birmingham, senior insiders have predicted. Moderate activists will be particularly alarmed if the two-day gathering, starting on Friday, sees Batten push ahead with his apparent plan to seek Ukip membership for the anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson, the sources said. Batten has appeared at several intermittently violent rallies supporting Robinson, the political stage name of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed for contempt of court over live broadcasts outside courts hearing rape trials. Last weekend Batten spoke at a rally in Sunderland organised by the so-called Democratic Football Lads Alliance, a Robinson-linked protest group that expresses anti-Islam sentiments based around the notion of combating sexual grooming gangs. Batten expresses similarly vehement views. He has said Islam is spread by “violence and intimidation”, and called for British Muslims to be asked to sign a document renouncing parts of the Qur’an. There will not be a formal debate at the conference about membership for Robinson, whom Batten has likened to Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, after this was blocked by Ukip national executive committee. Tories courted the Ukippers: now they’ll be consumed by them | Owen Jones However, in a sign of the ascendency of Batten it will hear from two controversial YouTube personalities who have been brought into Ukip as part of an attempt to reshape it for a post-Brexit age. This will include a speech by Mark Meechan, who makes videos under the name Count Dankula. He styles himself as a comedian and free-speech advocate, but remains best known for being fined after he posted an online video of his girlfriend pug dog giving Nazi salutes. There will also be a video address by Carl Benjamin, otherwise known as Sargon of Akkad. His content is based more around opposition to Islam, and he has been accused of misogyny and abuse, and of provoking Twitter rape threats (paywall) . Ukip sources said a significant number of disaffected members were closely watching to see whether Batten, who took over unopposed in April saying he would only serve for a year, shows signs of seeking to permanently change the party. One senior party member, who asked to not be named, said he believed Batten was backed by about of the party, but that many of the rest were considering their future. Media coverage of Ukip helped to increase its support, study says “If Gerard stays on, or the next leader supports his views, they would leave, the source said. “He seems to want to make us into more of a street movement, some sort of strange pressure group. “If there no change you could kiss our status as a political party goodbye. There no way on earth that I can go on the doorstep and sell this shit to people, and lots of others feel the same.” It is an unexpected path for a previously more mainstream organisation many credit with pushing David Cameron towards agreeing to the Brexit referendum, and was the third-biggest party by vote share at the election, under Nigel Farage . After Farage stepped down in Ukip slipped into chaos, with four permanent leaders and plummeting poll numbers. Batten was charged with stabilising the party after the disastrous tenure of Henry Bolton . He has received praise from many in Ukip for rescuing it from possible bankruptcy . Batten has also overseen a significant boost in membership , though it remains unclear whether this is down to his views or because of disquiet at the government Brexit plans. Another senior party source said the upcoming party conference seemed planned as “the confirmation of Gerard takeover, and the shift of the party towards the hard right”. Many moderate activists were considering their future, they said: “They’re probably lying low to see just how extreme it gets. Many of them are by the door, but looking back into the room, hoping there a chance to go back in.” A lot of members were deeply worried about Ukip future under Batten, they said: “The way things are going, Ukip will become an organisation with a large membership, but which never polls more than or “If you knock on doors, there an appetite for a sort of centre-right patriotic party with one or two rough edges. But there certainly no appetite for a hardcore, tough guy, marching the streets type of party. That just turns people off.” Batten declines to speak to the Guardian, which he has placed on a list of “biased media” with whom he will not engage.",773,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/20/disaffected-members-could-leave-ukip-if-gerard-batten-stays-leader-say-insiders
61,"Polling conducted in constituencies and on Eurosceptic issues of “potential strategic significance” to Ukip did not breach UK donation rules, an investigation has found. The Electoral Commission said the research could have benefited the party but did not conclude it was done to help Ukip or that the party received any of the results. The watchdog therefore ruled the polling was not a donation to Ukip under UK political finance rules, adding it would re-examine the issue should new evidence come to light. The commission work focused on whether Ukip took “impermissible donations” from the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe (ADDE), a grouping which had MEPs from several countries but with a large Ukip majority, and the Institute for Direct Democracy in Europe (IDDE). The investigation emerged after a European parliament audit found ADDE and IDDE misused more than of EU funding, including on polling of interest to Ukip linked to the general election and ahead of the EU referendum. Polling took place throughout in areas targeted by Ukip, including the South Thanet constituency contested by the party then leader, Nigel Farage , and across the home nations and in different EU countries. The total cost was estimated at The commission said: “While the ADDE and IDDE polling paid for by EPB (European Parliament Bureau) grant money was on topics relevant to Ukip, we did not conclude that it was done to help Ukip, or that Ukip received any of the outputs from the work. “Therefore, the polling work was not a donation to Ukip under UK political finance rules.” It added: “We saw that the polling work paid for by EPB grant funding was relevant to Ukip political position in “It was carried out in geographical areas of potential strategic significance to Ukip. The questions were about attitudes towards the EU. Media coverage of Ukip helped to increase its support, study says “The reports drawn up from the polling partly considered the data from a Ukip point of view. But we found insufficient evidence that the polls were commissioned to be for the benefit of Ukip and no evidence that Ukip received or benefited from any of this work.” The commission also noted two ADDE contractors who worked on some of the polling also worked as Ukip campaign managers during the general election. Bob Posner, the Electoral Commission director of political finance and regulation and legal counsel, said: “We undertook a thorough investigation that involved analysing a significant volume of evidence, as well as conducting interviews with a number of individuals. “For an offence to be found, we must be satisfied that the burden of proof meets a criminal standard. We were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ukip took impermissible donations in this case. “Should new evidence come to light that makes it appropriate for us to look again at this matter, we will do so.”",479,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/18/ukip-did-not-break-donation-rules-watchdog-finds

About demonstrators gathered outside the Sofitel on Collins Street on Friday night, where the former Ukip leader gave his last speech of a five-day Australian tour. Five people were arrested, one for criminal damage, another for riotous behaviour and a third for covering their face and assaulting police. Two others, a man and a woman, were arrested for unrelated outstanding matters, police said.

63,"Ukip annual conference could debate whether to lift a ban on the anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson becoming a member, a move which, if approved, would further indicate the party move to the far right. Under long-established party rules, former members of the English Defence League, which was formed by Robinson, are banned from joining, along with people who belonged to the British National party. But Ukip leader, Gerard Batten, has strongly backed Robinson, a self-styled freedom-of-speech activist whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, likening him to Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. The party national executive committee will discuss motions this weekend to be voted on at the conference in Birmingham, one of which will ask whether Robinson should be allowed to join. A spokesman said: “The NEC always decides what motions will be discussed at the party conference. Any party branch is free to submit a motion to the NEC.” Even if the motion is discussed, it would then ultimately be up to the NEC to decide whether the rules should be changed. Ukip ruling body can often go against the wishes of leaders, and some senior party members are known to greatly dislike Batten support for Robinson. But others are keen to link the party to Robinson, who was freed on bail in August pending a new hearing on whether he was in contempt of court by broadcasting details of a trial subject to reporting restrictions. He had already been given a suspended sentence for committing contempt during a rape trial in Canterbury after attempting to film the defendants. Alan Craig, Ukip families and children spokesman, told the Kipper Central website that Robinson had become “a global phenomenon representing those who have been excluded and silenced by the globalist liberal elite”. The submitted motion says Robinson had sought to “expose the authorities’ decades-long silence and inaction over industrial-scale child sexual abuse by rape gangs, and requests the NEC to offer him membership of Ukip”. The motion comes amid a more general shift in focus for Ukip under Batten, who took over the leadership in February. He has referred to Islam as a “death cult” and has called Muhammad a paedophile. Batten has also allowed a trio of controversial social media activists into the party, including Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars, a far-right US conspiracy theory website which has argued the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a hoax involving child actors. Some senior Ukip figures have privately expressed exasperation at Batten focus, and are calling on him to capitalise on the government woes over Brexit, particularly criticism of the Chequers plan.

64,"Conservative MPs warning of “entryism” in their party have faced a backlash from colleagues, who say the party should welcome an influx of new Brexit-supporting members. Leave.EU, the campaign group founded by businessman Arron Banks , is calling on its supporters to join the Conservative party to influence a future leadership vote, leading some remain-supporting MPs, including Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, to call for vigilance. But Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow and chair of the Commons education committee, dismissed those fears on Wednesday, and suggested Soubry and her allies instead recruit supporters from their own wing of the party. “We must be the only party in history complaining because we have more members,” he told the Guardian. “Seventeen million people voted to leave: in my constituency. Not many of them were robots of the Leave movement.” He said membership in his constituency party had increased by but he regarded that as a positive sign. “Even if they are Brexit people, the idea that Arron Banks has put a little chip in them is ridiculous.” Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, who resigned as a deputy chair of the party in protest over the prime minister Chequers deal, said he had also seen local membership rise since he took the seat from Labour at last year general election. “Obviously our town voted leave, so leave voters joining would not be ‘entryism’ – it very reflective of our local population and local views.” He added: “I’ve seen nothing to suggest it anything more than us continuing to grow support locally as we have done for a year or more, no evidence it an ‘infiltration’ or anything like that.” Banks himself was refused membership earlier this month but continues to spearhead a bid to persuade Eurosceptics to join the Tory party. Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of the pro-Brexit candidates favoured by Banks and his allies, has disowned their efforts , saying: “They’re not doing it in my name. Of course I want people to join the Conservative party, but I want them to join because they support a broad swath of values.” Meanwhile, chairs of local Conservative associations are being reminded to check new members regularly and weed out those “whose declared opinions or conduct shall, in their judgement, be inconsistent with the objects or financial well-being of the association, or likely to bring the party into disrepute”. In a letter obtained by the Guido Fawkes website, the party head of membership, Natalie Crosby-Jones, reminds constituency chairs that they have an obligation to scrutinise members before confirming their membership on the party internal system. “Please check these individuals carefully before you click ‘Approve’,” she wrote. With Theresa May facing an intensely challenging six months, and a growing number of her own MPs restless about the Chequers deal, the prospect of a leadership contest looks increasingly likely. Grassroots members would then have the final say, after MPs whittled the candidates down to two. When asked en route to South Africa earlier this week about whether she would step aside if she faced a vote of no confidence, May insisted she was “in it for the long term” ; but few in Westminster expect her to stay on much beyond March next year, when Britain is due to leave the EU. Campaign groups on both sides of the Brexit divide are readying themselves for the battle ahead, as negotiations in Brussels reach their final months.

66,"Disproportionate British newspaper coverage of Ukip helped to increase support for the party, according to a new academic study, amid a growing debate on the role the media plays in boosting the popularity of anti-immigrant political parties. Political scientists at the University of Southampton investigated whether increased media coverage of Ukip caused support for the pro-Brexit party to rise – or whether the opposite is true, and increased public support for Ukip prompted the media to dedicate more space to the party. The research, published this week in the British Journal of Political Science , concluded there is a direct statistical relationship between the two factors, with increased media coverage slightly aiding Ukip subsequent poll ratings. However, the overall effect was very limited, with the academics concluding that even months that saw an “exceptionally large” increase in Ukip press coverage could cause the party national poll rating to later rise by just – a fraction of the party rise over the period studied. “Just because there is a positive statistical relationship between media coverage and public support doesn’t mean media coverage is the main driver of Ukip support by any stretch,” said politics lecturer Justin Murphy, the report lead author. “I do think [media coverage of Ukip] has a non-trivial effect that journalists would do well to understand,” he added. “But the study certainly does not suggest nor prove that the media is the main cause of Ukip public support.” The research is particularly relevant because of the debate on whether the media is playing a role in boosting support for rightwing activists such as Steve Bannon and Tommy Robinson. The academic report, which looked at Ukip rise and media presence between and was adjusted for factors such as the unemployment rate and historic polling on whether voters were concerned about immigration. Murphy said there were times when the British press increased the number of articles it wrote about Ukip, even as the party was falling in the polls: “There are a few key periods where Ukip support is going down and you see exceptional, extraordinary upward spikes in the amount of media coverage. At one point in early the media coverage of Ukip is off the charts, at a time where you can clearly see that Ukip support had been decreasing for the previous few weeks.” The study also found Ukip benefited substantially from the increased media attention around European parliament elections – one of the few important British elections held under a proportional representation system – which enabled the party to build its brand. The study did not look at the coverage given to Ukip by TV and radio stations, which are heavily regulated and required to provide balance on their political programmes. It also did not consider the content of the stories about Ukip, merely counting whether the party was being written about at all. “Probably a great deal of the media coverage in our study is negative towards Ukip,” said Murphy. “Our paper does not show any pro-Ukip bias in the media.” Ukip support is changing, and with it the contours of British politics | Peter Kellner Although not covered by the research, Murphy speculated that it could in fact be this critical coverage of Ukip that helped to attract voters to the party: “If you’re a voter and you mistrust politicians and the media, then when you hear the media report negatively about Ukip in an unintended way the negative media coverage is actually interpreted as a signal to increase support for the party.” Prof Rob Ford of the University of Manchester, who has written about the rise of Ukip but was not involved in this research, said the paper does appear to show journalists “can move the dial a little bit by getting overexcited”. He said the level of media coverage for Ukip has almost always been in excess of what it is polling and that may well have introduced the party to people who would start to consider voting for it. However, he warned against putting too much emphasis on one factor to explain the party historic rise in popularity: “There were lots of people in lots of surveys who don’t read any newspapers at all and their level of support for Ukip wasn’t substantially different – so where are they getting it from?”",721,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/05/media-coverage-of-ukip-helped-to-increase-its-support-study-says
67,"Ukip membership has soared by in a month, insiders have revealed, raising the prospect of a return to the mainstream of a party still publicly associated with Brexit , but which has recently taken a more hard-right nationalist stance. The arrival of nearly new members in July, and a boost in the polls from around to or more, follows Theresa May Chequers plan. Senior Ukip members say they believe many people are returning from the Conservatives. This sets up a possible battle for supremacy in a party which under the leadership of Gerard Batten has talked more in recent months about Islam than Brexit, and now has close links to Tommy Robinson , the far-right activist released from prison on Wednesday. Batten, who took over in February, refers to Islam as a “death cult” and has called the prophet Muhammad a paedophile. He has also likened Robinson, the founder of the English Defence League , to Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, saying he is “on the right side of a great cause in a struggle between good and evil”. This embrace has prompted disquiet among some senior Ukip members, as has Batten decision to welcome a trio of controversial social media activists into the party, including from the far-right website Infowars. One party figure, who asked to not be named, said some MEPs and other senior members had urged Batten to tone down his hard-right rhetoric and focus more on disaffection about the Chequers plan. “It seems ludicrous to be talking about anything other than Brexit at the moment,” the figure said. “We’ve all got our personal policy interests, but this is the only subject in town right now.” Another senior member said Batten stance had brought certain MEPs close to quitting. “Some people don’t like at all where Gerard is taking the party, but they’re keeping quiet because of Chequers,” they said. “It also seems likely that some of the new members don’t quite realise what sort of party Ukip is now.” The resurgence is relative. At about membership is almost less than half of its peak of in However, it is a welcome boost for a party that has lurched from crisis to crisis , and took just of the vote in last year general election. A complicating factor is that not all the new members will be motivated by Brexit. The party has attracted new interest from younger people following the endorsement of the three popular YouTube-based activists. These include Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars, a US website which has argued the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a hoax involving child actors. It means that if others in the party did want a change in direction – even Nigel Farage, who has pledged to return to frontline politics next year if he feels Brexit is being thwarted – they might struggle to wrest back control . “There enough people in Ukip now who follow Gerard line,” the first senior source said. “It would take a lot of organisation to turn the party round, and it doesn’t currently exist. Instead you’ll probably have two parties in one. Those following Gerard views and the people there for Brexit and the Chequers deal.” If Batten remains in charge and Ukip continues to prosper, pressure groups say the party could become the UK first modern hard-right political force to join the mainstream, similar to the National Rally, formerly the National Front, in France, or Alternative for Germany (AfD). Some within Ukip have reportedly held talks with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump former chief strategist, who has pledged to work with populist and far-right parties across Europe. Batten declined to talk to the Guardian, and a party spokesman said the paper was on a list of “biased media” to which it will no longer comment. At a rally in support of Robinson in London earlier this month, however, Batten reiterated his hardline anti-Islam stance. “I want our descendants to be free, not to live under Islamic ideology,” he said. Batten told the crowd: “The founder of their cult was himself a paedophile and kept sex slaves. And yet he is held up to be the perfect model of a man for all time. But we, the infidels and the kafirs, are not supposed to talk about it.” Nick Ryan from Hope Not Hate, which tracks far-right groups, said such views, coupled with existing community tensions and potential disaffection over Brexit, could bring “potent conditions for a radical right movement to try and take advantage of the inevitable anger which will occur”. Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at Kent University, who has studied Ukip closely, takes a different view. He said links to Robinson and Infowars could bar a return to mainstream support for a party that won almost votes in the election. “As a to party I think there will be space for Ukip among disgruntled Conservatives, immigration-minded blue-collar workers and older voters,” he said. “But in order for Ukip to ever get to be a to party, which it did manage to do in the past, it going to have to have a charismatic leader, dissociate itself from stigma and look relatively mainstream and acceptable, in particular for the middle class.”",870,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/02/ukip-membership-surges-15-per-cent-in-a-month

David Bannerman, a former Ukip deputy leader who defected back to the Conservatives in told the Guardian he was referring to those who might leak confidential information that would damage Britain interests after Brexit. The MEP tweeted on Wednesday: “It is about time we brought the Treason Act up to date and made it apply to those seeking to destroy or undermine the British state. That means extreme jihadis. It also means those in future actively working undemocratically against UK through extreme EU loyalty.” His tweet included a copy of Wednesday Daily Telegraph front page, which reported on calls for treason laws to be updated and used to prosecute jihadis who have fought in Syria. A report published on Tuesday by the right-leaning Policy Exchange thinktank had said the law should allow enemies of the state to be jailed for life. Among those criticising Bannerman was the broadcaster Gavin Esler, who is chancellor at the University of Kent. He tweeted at the MEP : “Unfortunately your comment equating support for the EU with jihadis and treason requires no exaggeration – merely an apology to half the population who are sick of such Brexcrement. Since you are sucking on the euro-teat as an MEP have you no shame?” Virendra Sharma, the Labour MP for Ealing Southall, accused Bannerman of “putting a knife into free speech”. “One of the best things about this country is the range of opinions that help diversify our political debate. David Bannerman should think long and hard about his spiteful populist rhetoric,” said Sharma in a statement issued by the pro-remain campaign group Best for Britain Bannerman said he was not referring to those who protest against Brexit or “work democratically” for the UK to join the EU after Brexit . Don’t wish for a new party to end the Brexit mess. It will be a far-right one | Martha Gill He said: “I am talking, for example, about the leaking of confidential information on negotiations or other confidential documents to the EU, where the intent is an anti-British one. I am also talking about it after Brexit. In no way would I want to curtail debate.” Bannerman said the relationship between the UK and the EU would change significantly in future, adding: “The EU would become a separate power, a separate state and we would have to treat it in the same way as China or Russia.” The comments come amid concern about the tone of some of the language being used by Brexit-supporting media and supporters, including last year “ Crush the saboteurs ” front-page headline in the Daily Mail. Some have also said that the language used in attacks on the investor George Soros over a donation to Best for Britain echoes the antisemitic campaign against him made by nationalist groups and governments in eastern European countries.

69,"The newly elected leader of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has said that a no-deal Brexit would lead to economic disaster for Wales and could strengthen the case for independence. Adam Price , in an interview with the Guardian after replacing Leanne Wood as leader on Friday, said he backed the idea of a people vote on Brexit and that a “remain” option should be on the ballot paper. But if a no-deal Brexit did bring about an economic crisis it could prompt more people in Wales to come to the conclusion that independence from Westminster may be the best option, he said. Price made it clear that his first priority was to improve the party machine to put it in a position to win power at the next assembly elections in The said: “We have to take every opportunity to end the cataclysm that is heading our way. If we are able to get a people vote we should take that opportunity and ‘remain’ should be on the ballot. “If we don’t avoid a no-deal Brexit, we are going to see an unravelling of the Welsh economy on a scale because of the importance of agriculture and manufacturing on our economy. “We’re about stopping it but if it happens it will be a crisis on a huge level. We will have to think how best to defend ourselves in those circumstances and that may accelerate the path towards independence. It may be then that the people of Wales will want to move faster towards independence.” Hard Brexit and China deal would wipe out Welsh steel industry, first minister claims Price, in his victory speech in Cardiff, paid tribute to Wood, the first female leader of the party and a popular figure on the UK stage after she called out the then Ukip leader Nigel Farage during a general election debate. “As the first openly gay man to lead this party, and indeed any party in Wales … I am a modern, inclusive leader,” said Price. “No one will be left behind. There will be no second-class travellers on our journey to a confident, prosperous and independent Wales.” Price, the assembly member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said the leadership contest result showed the party was ready to “believe again”. The miner son added: “All members must dig deep. Each of us must grab a shovel. We must mine a new seam of confidence and reopen with toil, tenacity and tenderness the deep-running vein of passion, patriotism and purpose that we know runs though the country of this great nation.” Plaid Cymru Westminster group leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said the leadership election had been energising. She said: “I look forward to working with Adam Price to take the fight to the Labour Welsh government in Cardiff and the Tories in Westminster. “Between our membership and supporters there is a spirit for change: to raise confidence and ambition, to perceive independence as the natural protection against looming threats, and as an assertion of faith in a future of our own making.” Price was an MP for nearly a decade before leaving to study at Harvard in the US.

The World Cup is a very special international competition. It something that brings people together on a very large scale and we need recognition of that and recognition of the importance of football in the country. Any such bank holiday should cover the whole of the UK, not just England, the spokesman added. Owen Paterson , the Conservative Brexiter and former cabinet minister, has said that the new customs plan being considered by ministers, the third one that emerged on Monday, sounds like little more than a rebrand” of the “unacceptable” customs partnership model which would see the UK collect duties on behalf of the EU. He said: We cannot deliver any of the economic benefits of Brexit without leaving the customs union cleanly and completely, freeing ourselves to forge our own trade relationships with friends and allies across the world and committing to the principles of free trade. The Conservative manifesto at the last general election - which secured the most votes of any party since - was unambiguously clear: ‘As we leave the European Union, we will no longer be members of the single market or customs union’.

Updated at BST Plaid Leanne Wood faces leadership challenge As the BBC reports, the former MP Adam Price and Rhun ap Iorwerth are to challenge Leanne Wood for the leadership of Plaid Cymru. Both are now members of the Welsh assembly. Announcing his bid, Price said: Following the recommendation of the assembly group to invite members to discuss a future leadership model, and the subsequent positive reaction from Leanne Wood, teams for both I and Leanne negotiated throughout the day, in good faith, to reach a way forward which recognised the need for change and avoid the need to challenge. My proposal for a new leadership model [a co-leader plan] was a sincere and creative attempt to inject a fresh dynamic into the team. I believe it remains a practical and progressive way forward and it could have made a traditional contest avoidable. However, media statements soon indicated the negotiations were being undermined. So we must park the proposal for the time being and revert to established procedure. But we cannot put off the irresistible call for defining change. Change in the way we frame our politics; the projection of who we are, what we stand for, what we have fought long and hard for and what ultimately important to us. The areas where we will not compromise; the places where we can work with partners. And here is a statement from ap Iorwerth. A few weeks ago, Leanne invited a debate on the leadership of Plaid Cymru – the party of Wales, a debate that could lead to reaffirming her leadership or starting a new chapter in the history of the party. Since then there been much discussion about the merits of such a debate. Supporters and members of the party from all parts of Wales – from the south Wales valleys to the north and mid-Wales, from the west to Cardiff – have encouraged me to allow my name to go forward. That encouragement has come from people at all elected levels, but mainly from ordinary party members, including some who, I’m quite sure, will back Leanne! And that the point – this should be a constructive debate, a positive one that can energise the party and the country, and it in THAT spirit that I am accepting the nominations. And in the spirit of real excitement and passion about the future of our country.

Why buses are such an important issue for Labour voters Jeremy Corbyn decision to focus on bus issues at PMQs came as a surprise and opinion is divided as to whether or not this was a good idea. (See But if you want to know why Corbyn raised the topic, this table probably helps to explain things. It is from a Hansard Society book about the last election, Britain Votes and (bear with me) it shows “correlation coefficients measuring the associations between the shares of the vote obtained by the parties in constituencies and the usual range of social and demographic variables”. Put simply, the higher the number, the greater the link between this factor and the chances of people in the constituency voting for said party. In the past class was the big dividing line in British politics but these figures confirm that this is no longer the case. Places with lots of manual workers are more Labour and places with lots of professional/managerial workers are more Conservative but the correlation is low. Age is a much more significant factor now in determining how people will vote. But the single factor that most seems to overlap with voting Labour is not class, or age, or ethnicity, or even being a renter rather than a owner occupier. It not having a car.

71,"Pressure on the Welsh first minister over the death of the Labour politician Carl Sargeant has grown after opposition parties won a vote in the national assembly demanding the publication of a report on events surrounding the tragedy. Sargeant is believed to have killed himself four days after he was removed from his post as a minister following unspecified allegations of sexual harassment, which he denied. The first of three investigations into the matter, examining whether news of Sargeant sacking was leaked, concluded there was no “unauthorised disclosure” . But there is anger that the report has not been published and the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru argued during an assembly debate on Wednesday that a redacted version should be released. The Conservative leader in Wales , Andrew RT Davies, said journalists and lobbyists knew in advance that Sargeant was being sacked. He said it was a “pretty reasonable request” for the report to be published so its conclusions could be scrutinised. Llŷr Huws Gruffydd, of Plaid Cymru, said the public would believe there was something to hide if it was not published. “If Carwyn Jones [the Welsh first minster] has nothing to hide he should have nothing to fear from publishing the report.”. The Labour assembly member Lee Waters, who has been identified as one of those who knew in advance of the sacking, confirmed he had received a text message about it but said it was “gossip” and not from an official source. He warned that publishing the report could create a “trail of breadcrumbs” to those who made allegations about Sargeant.

Commons committee demands assurances about supply of medical radioisotopes after Brexit The Commons European scrutiny committee has challenged ministers to explain how they will ensure the UK maintains a secure supply of medical radioisotopes after Brexit. Radioisotopes are used to detect cancer. As it published a report on this issue, the committee said in a statement: The committee concern comes in the light of the serious shortage of radioisotopes [from to due to the prolonged shutdown of supply reactors in Canada and the Netherlands. The principal material, is not produced in the UK and its decay product is ultimately used for of medical interventions involving radioisotopes. Molybdenum cannot be stockpiled as it has a half-life of only hours. The security of supply of isotopes is currently fulfilled by the Euratom Supply Agency. Euratom provides the basis for the regulation of civilian nuclear activity, implements a system of safeguards to control the use of nuclear materials and controls the supply of fissile materials within EU member states. The UK future relationship with Euratom has emerged as a significant issue in the negotiations between the UK and the EU on EU withdrawal. The European Commission warns that the supply of medical radioisotopes is becoming more fragile and requires a more coordinated approach. The European Scrutiny Committee seeks assurance from the Government and an explanation of how the UK will develop its own policy. Philippa Whitford , an SNP member of the committee, said: I was working as a breast cancer surgeon during the Technetium shortage which lasted well over a year. During that time we were faced with having to ration bone scans to only the most urgent or worrying cases. In addition it held back the roll out of Sentinel Node Biopsy technique across the UK which has since allowed much less destructive surgery to be used when staging the spread of breast cancer. With all of these reactors nearing the end of their working lives, the Euratom Supply Agency plays an important role in avoiding such a shortage in the future.

Wales needs self-determination, not Tory neoliberalism or state socialism, says Leanne Wood Leanne Wood , the leader of Plaid Cymru, gave a major speech earlier today setting out her “vision for a fairer Wales”. In it she argued that the Tories were offering neoliberalism and that Labour were offering state socialism and that neither were what Wales needed. She said: Decisions about Wales should be made in Wales. Self-determination means that we should choose which powers we want to share with other countries or with Europe. Yet neither an intensification of neoliberalism, nor the resurrection of British state socialism will provide the solutions that are needed to solve our economic challenges and turn Wales around. Both visions offered by the two largest Westminster parties marginalise our specific needs as a nation. We need to get out there and show people how the core weakness of Labour paternalistic, centralising socialism is its democratic deficit. It will neither enable people to own their own resources nor run them democratically. It won’t empower people because it doesn’t trust people. We should look at locating new institutions outside where they are concentrated already, as Plaid Cymru has advocated for the new transport authority, football museum, national development bank, and other bodies. It means ensuring that those parts of Cardiff as well as our former industrialised communities which are amongst the poorest areas of the country, can benefit from a sustainable regional approach to economic development. This is about levelling up, and treating geographic inequality as a problem to be tackled in the same way as other inequalities. She also proposed legal safeguards to ensure public sector investment is fairly shared across Wales and giving people a minimum set of social rights for all including life-long learning and a decent home Wood lecture is being published as a pamphlet and she intends to tour Wales holding public meetings discussing the ideas it contains. of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Labour Scottish National party (SNP) Scottish politics Nicola Sturgeon Boris Johnson",1587,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/15/brexit-impact-analysis-nicola-sturgeon-to-publish-scottish-governments-brexit-impact-analysis-politics-live
73,"Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of a lack of leadership after rejecting a call to join a cross-party coalition to keep Britain in the EU single market after Brexit. The SNP said the Labour leader was failing millions of working families after he turned down an invitation to coordinate efforts with other parties to block government moves to take the UK out of the single market when it leaves the EU. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, is due to meet the leaders of the Liberal Democrats , Plaid Cymru and the Green party on Monday to discuss a common approach to the issue in the weeks ahead. But in a letter to Blackford, Corbyn declined an offer to take part, saying the initiative was based on a “flawed” assumption about the nature of the single market. Labour has repeatedly said it wants to secure a Brexit deal that retains the benefits of the single market and the customs union , but has stopped short of saying the UK would remain in the single market beyond a limited transition period after leaving the EU in March The Labour leader refusal will disappoint anti-Brexit Labour MPs and activists who want Corbyn to shift to a more pro-EU position to keep young voters on board and secure more floating voters who backed remain. Many Labour MPs and activists say Corbyn should commit to permanent membership of the single market and customs union as a minimum. Some others in the party including former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis want him to go further by backing a second referendum on EU membership when the eventual terms of Brexit are known. In his letter to Blackford, Corbyn said: “Your proposed summit appears to be based on the flawed assumption that the single market is a membership club – it is not. “We have consistently said that we are committed to negotiating to keep the benefits of the single market and securing the best possible deal for the whole of Britain, which protects our economy and the people of this country, whilst at the same time respecting the result of the referendum.” However Blackford warned that unless opposition parties were able to prevent the government leaving the single market and the customs union, it would take a “wrecking ball” to the economy. “With just over a year to go before the UK is set to leave the EU, it is now more important than ever that we have a united and effective opposition – holding the UK government to account, and doing everything within our power to prevent this Tory economic catastrophe,” he said. “It is unbelievable – and frankly, utterly pathetic – that on the single biggest issue facing the country Jeremy Corbyn has failed to show any leadership whatsoever, and is now rejecting this crucial chance to build a cross-party coalition in the national interest. “His absence from this meeting is deeply disappointing but it is not surprising given his absence from the EU referendum campaign and the national debate on Brexit ever since.” A Labour party spokesman dismissed the cross-party meeting as “little more than a political gimmick”. “We will work with all parties to hold this government to account every step of the way and achieve a jobs-first Brexit that puts living standards and the economy first,” the spokesman said.",559,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/07/jeremy-corbyn-lacks-leadership-for-snubbing-brexit-coalition

75,"Dozens of Labour MPs are preparing to team up with the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens to back an amendment to the Queen speech calling for Britain to remain in the EU customs union and single market. The politicians are hoping to coalesce around wording being put forward by Labour backbenchers, which lays out plans for a softer form of Brexit than is being proposed by both Theresa May government and their own frontbench. The MPs say they regret that the speech “does not rule out withdrawal from the EU without a deal; guarantee a parliamentary vote on any final outcome to negotiations; or set out transitional arrangements to maintain jobs, trade and certainty for business”. Sour taste of Brexit talks on citizens' rights shows there is work to do | Dan Roberts They want membership of the customs union and of the single market to be maintained, but also urge more respect for the devolved nations in the process of exiting the EU. The amendment could yet win the backing of the Liberal Democrats . The MPs also want “clear protections for EU nationals living in the UK now, including retaining their right to remain in the UK, and reciprocal rights for UK citizens”. The amendment will not necessarily be picked for debate, but the decision of so many Labour MPs to back it could be a headache for the party leadership, which is attempting to maintain a nuanced position over the question of single market membership. Speaking in the Queen speech debate in parliament on Monday, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer urged the government to drop its “no deal mantra” – warning that no agreement with the would be the equivalent of being pushed over a cliff. And he criticised the government legislative agenda, saying it was “threadbare and lacks ambition”. “There is no detail, there can’t be because the prime minister gambled and lost. A majority became a minority, all bets are off for the future,” said Starmer. But some Labour MPs are frustrated that Starmer did not go further on the issue of remaining in the single market. Starmer told the Guardian he believes in the importance of “function rather than form” – meaning he wants to replicate the benefits of the single market and customs union, without necessarily remaining a member. If the amendment is picked, it will win a large amount of opposition support – but Tories are unlikely to vote against their party on the Queen speech itself. However, a number of Conservative MPs could work with other parties to push for a soft Brexit after this week vote is passed. EU citizens: what do you think of the ettled status' ID card? Tory MP Anna Soubry, a remainer, told parliament that her own frontbench had to “wake up and understand that things have now changed – the rhetoric has to be dropped”. She said she had warned colleagues that they would be punished electorally for failing to consider those who opposed Brexit, and said she was sorry to have been proved right on June. “I warned of the dangers of ignoring the and the young in particular,” she said. “Many young people who voted remain believe an older generation have stolen their future.” Soubry urged the Labour party to stand up and fight for the customs union if it believed in the benefits of it. And she argued that people who voted remain were resigned to the outcome, but that her plea was for opponents to “come together to get the best deal in the national interest”.",596,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/26/labour-mps-to-join-snp-greens-and-plaid-to-resist-single-market-exit

Heather Stewart Steve Baker, the chair of the influential pro-Brexit European Research Group of backbench MPs, has thrown his weight behind Theresa May. “My principal thought is that it essential that Conservative MPs support Theresa May as prime minister, and make it possible to form the most stable government possible,” he told the Guardian. In the run-up to the article vote earlier this year, Baker played a key role in coordinating Conservative MPs, and liaising with Downing Street on their behalf. Updated at BST Nicky Morgan , the former education secretary, is the latest senior Tory to stand behind Theresa May but she suggested calling the election had been an error. Speaking to the BBC, she said: “This is a result obviously that she absolutely did not want and none of us wanted. That going to make life difficult. I think she should carry on. She is entitled as prime minister to see if she is able to form a government. People do want there to be clarity about leadership, we’ve got the very important Brexit negotiations starting in days.” Asked if she had confidence in May leadership, Morgan said: “I think Theresa May is a competent and more than capable prime minister and leader of the party, but clearly there has been a misjudgment in the way we started off thinking there was going to be a significant win for the Conservative party, that hasn’t happened, we need to understand why.” Updated at BST The former Labour foreign secretary and one-time Labour leadership hopeful, David Miliband, has expressed his surprise and delight at the result. “So good brutal Brexit rejected,” he tweeted. Updated at BST The European council president, Donald Tusk, reminds the UK of the ticking clock on the Brexit negotiations. Updated at BST Martin Kettle The result has transformed the UK political landscape. Hung parliaments are good news for whips, civil servants, journalists and opposition parties. Anyone who thrives in the engine room of politics is going to love the next few months and years. But the real winner in a hung parliament is the political leader, or even the political idea, that rises above the short-term and points a way to less turbulent times. Who that leader is, or what that big idea might be, is one of the many fascinating uncertainties the country now faces. The real winner in a hung parliament is whoever can see past it | Martin Kettle Groups campaigning for the rights of the million EU citizens in Britain and million UK nationals on the continent have said that with Brexit negotiations now likely to start with a hung parliament, it is even more vital that all political parties undertake to secure citizens’ rights after Brexit. In a joint statement, Nicolas Hatton, the co-chair of and Jane Golding, the chair of the British in Europe Coalition, said the new government must “ringfence citizens’ rights from other aspects of the article withdrawal agreement to make them legally binding in the event negotiations fail”. The groups also want new legislation to enable all EU citizens to claim their individual rights by March “There is a huge task ahead, considering million people need to be documented to continue to live normally in Britain after Brexit,” said Hatton. Golding added: “The EU has made a generous, unilateral offer to UK citizens in the EU and is prepared to guarantee the vast majority of our rights. Now the election is over, we need urgently to know the UK response to that offer so we can see an end to the uncertainty facing thousands of families.” Updated at BST Henry McDonald The Democratic Unionists will only support a Conservative government if Northern Ireland is not granted any unique special status that would keep the region halfway inside the EU, the party leader at Westminster has confirmed. Nigel Dodds, who was re-elected in his North Belfast seat, said the DUP would insist there would be no post-Brexit deal that could decouple Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. It will be one of the DUP key preconditions in negotiations with the Tories to help them form a new administration. With one eye on the Brexit negotiations, which begin within the next to days, Dodds said: “There are special circumstances in Northern Ireland and we will try to make sure these are recognised. “As regards demands for special status within the European Union, no. Because that would create tariffs and barriers between Northern Ireland and our single biggest market which is the rest of the United Kingdom. “While we will focus on the special circumstances, geography and certain industries of Northern Ireland, we will be pressing that home very strongly. Special status however within the European Union is a nonsense. Dublin doesn’t support it. “Brussels doesn’t support it. The member states of the EU would never dream of it because it would open the door to a Pandora box of independence movements of all sorts. The only people who mentioned this are Sinn Féin.” The DUP won of the Northern Ireland seats with Sinn Féin winning seven and the remaining seat in North Down still in the hands of the Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon. Updated at BST The EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, says the Brexit negotiations should start when the UK is ready, but that the (two-year) timetable and the EU position is clear. Bohuslav Sobotka, the prime minister of the Czech Republic, says the UK is not ready to start negotiations. Updated at BST Ewen MacAskill Momentum, the Labour organisation set up to support Jeremy Corbyn, hailed the results as a success for a superior ground game and campaign techniques deployed for the first time. The organisation helped mobilise activists in targeting marginals and exploit social media in support of the overall Labour campaign. Adam Klug, Momentum national organiser, said: “The ground game was crucial to this in terms of mobilising and enthusing activists, many of them first-time canvassers. Momentum played a major part in this. “I think it is the end of the old way of doing politics.” While most of the media focus was on Corbyn, Labour was engaged in a largely unseen effort on the ground, using its large base of volunteers as a counter to the Conservatives’ higher spending. Klug had been a primary teacher when he volunteered in to work in Corbyn first leadership contest and went on to work full-time for Momentum, which grew out of the campaign. He and his colleagues have not yet celebrated. “We did not win,” said Klug, who said the organisation would continue campaigning, building for the next time. Labour had won more seats than he had expected. Had all the speculation that Corbyn would have to resign or face another leadership challenge now gone? “I think definitely,” Klug said. During the election, Momentum developed a tool to help direct volunteers to the nearest marginals: the site attracted unique users. “This was five times the size of Momentum. We reached out way beyond our bubble,” Klug said. One in four UK Facebook users had viewed a Momentum video in the final week of the campaign, he said. They also developed an app to help people engage in phone-canvassing from their homes or anywhere else rather than go to phone banks. With the help of about half a dozen volunteers from the Bernie Sanders campaign, it introduced techniques pioneered during the US campaign, with a big effort aimed at training canvassers. Three thousand came to training days throughout the UK, about two-thirds of them first-time canvassers, Klug said. Momentum asked for volunteers to take Thursday off to get people to the polls. Klug said about volunteered, knocking on an estimated doors.

77,"Scotland Scotland party leaders put heavy emphasis on health spending, childcare and welfare cuts. With a political landscape shaped by a centre-left agenda, even the Conservatives tack towards the middle ground. Competing for centre-ground votes, the Scottish Tories have pledged to keep free NHS prescriptions, reversing their opposition to a policy that helped Alex Salmond win power for the Scottish National party a decade ago. The Tories would keep universal winter fuel payments in Scotland . Nominally because Scotland is colder, they believe Theresa May new means-testing policy will be more electorally damaging north of the border. With devolution, Holyrood controls the majority of social policy, with in welfare spending also devolved. In this election every manifesto mixes UK and Scottish pledges. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, is attacked over hospital waiting times failures, which are Holyrood responsibility. So she attacks Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, over the UK government so-called rape clause, where parents must in some cases prove a third child was conceived by rape to get extra child tax credits. Davidson neither designed nor controls that policy. Sturgeon pledges SNP MPs will vote against NHS cuts in England to protect Scotland share of that spending, while&nbsp;promising extra for health in&nbsp;Scotland. Labour and the Lib Dems also promise significant extra NHS spending and higher Scottish child benefit rates, financed by tax rises, which the SNP&nbsp;rejects. Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems promise to protect the triple lock on UK pensions, abolish the two-child cap on tax credits, and lift the pay cap on public sector pay. The Tories would retain Scotland distinct, free personal-care policy for the elderly, while in England they would introduce the so-called “dementia tax”. Wales The UK parties each include distinctive polices for Wales . The Tories pledge to modernise rail infrastructure, set-up a UK shared prosperity fund to replace EU aid, a “growth deal” and give more powers to the Welsh government post-Brexit. In contrast, Labour would retain Brussels’ level of economic aid after Brexit, hand over control of police to the Welsh Assembly and provide around extra for Welsh public services. The Lib Dems want to transfer powers over transport, energy and criminal justice to Cardiff and to give an extra to the NHS and social care in Wales, paid for from its on UK income tax,plus more a year to police. Plaid Cymru promises an extra for Welsh police and greater control over police budgets, which have been hit hard by Home Office cuts. It also pledges to block the development of the Port Talbot “superprison” . At Westminster, it has made all the running campaigning for new laws to protect victims of rape and domestic abuse and promises they could give evidence in court without being intimidated. It also pledges to fight to guarantee the pensions triple lock. Labour would plough more than from its new national investment bank into Wales. Plaid Cymru promises a investment programme. On energy, Labour supports the Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant on Anglesey and, both Labour and the Lib Dems, would give the go-ahead to the Swansea tidal lagoon power plant. Both the Tories and Labour want to scrap the Severn bridges tolls for all traffic. Northern Ireland The breakdown of power sharing between the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and Sinn Féin at Stormont and the future of the border with the Irish Republic post-Brexit overshadow the UK election in Northern Ireland. The DUP promises to protect Northern Ireland place in the UK, while Sinn Féin pledges to deliver special designated status for Northern Ireland within the EU. The Alliance party, like the Lib Dems, wants to hold a referendum on the final Brexit deal, with an option to remain in the EU. On public services there similarly little consensus, with the DUP promising to abolish the Health and Social Care Board, establish a fund to reduce hospital waiting lists, and create new jobs. Sinn Féin is calling for an end to “swingeing cuts” imposed by Westminster and to explore the potential economic benefits of increased all-Ireland co-operation on public services. It would ensure that doctors from EU countries could remain in their jobs after Brexit and guarantee continued free access to healthcare across the EU. It would also scrap zero-hours contracts and protect workers’ rights. The main UK parties say little on the country public services. The Lib Dems would devolve more powers to the assembly.

78,"Jeremy Corbyn challenged Amber Rudd over the impact of the government spending cuts as he sought to exploit the cracks in the Conservatives’ general election campaign with his last-minute decision to take part in a live leaders’ debate on on Wednesday night. General election May absence dominates leaders' debate – politics live The Labour leader took on the home secretary, who was standing in for the absent Theresa May , over the government economic record in a scrappy seven-way televised debate in Cambridge. “I would just say this to Amber, if she thinks this is a country at ease with itself: have you been to a food bank?” Corbyn said. “Have you seen people sleeping around our stations? Have you seen the levels of poverty that exist because of your government conscious decisions on benefits?” Rudd countered, saying: “The way to have people not using food banks is have a stronger economy.” She repeatedly attacked the Labour leader, accusing him of wanting to fund his manifesto promises from a “magic money tree”. But the audience – chosen by the BBC to be politically balanced – laughed when Rudd said: “I would say judge us on our record.” The home secretary questioned Corbyn leadership, pointing to the vote of no confidence in him by a majority of Labour MPs last summer. Corbyn said: “Leadership is about understanding the people you represent. It about being prepared to learn. It about not being so high and mighty that you can’t take advice.” It later emerged that Rudd had decided to go ahead with her appearance in the debate despite the death of her elderly father on Monday night. Corbyn, who initially had not been expected to attend the debate, used a stump speech in Reading on Wednesday lunchtime to urge the prime minister to “go to Cambridge” and defend her policies publicly. On Thursday morning the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, defended May absence, saying it showed “prudence and wisdom”. “What that debate showed very clearly is the wisdom of the prime minister in not coming,” he said. It was a chaotic cacophony of different voices, and elucidated absolutely nothing, I thought, except for a couple of good points that Amber Rudd was able to get over to Jeremy Corbyn.” He said the event had “the most lefwing audience I’ve ever seen”. Along with Corbyn and Rudd, the debate featured the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, Ukip Paul Nuttall, the SNP deputy leader, Angus Robertson, Caroline Lucas of the Greens and Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru. Corbyn last-minute decision to participate in the debate was a high-stakes gamble. At the outset of the campaign, Corbyn spokesman had suggested the choice on June was about who would be Britain next prime minister, and a debate with other party leaders – and without May – would not help voters to make that decision. But with the Conservatives’ poll lead narrowing, and May vulnerable on the issue of social care, Corbyn team believed the idea that May had ducked a debate would resonate with voters. In a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, the Labour leader said: “I have never been afraid of a debate in my life. Labour campaign has been about taking our policies to people across the country and listening to the concerns of voters. “The Tories have been conducting a stage-managed arms-length campaign and have treated the public with contempt.” Speaking at a campaign event in Bath on Wednesday, May sought to laugh off the idea that she was frightened of taking part. “Jeremy Corbyn seems to be paying far more attention to how many appearances on telly he doing. He ought to be paying a bit more attention to thinking about Brexit negotiations. That what I’m doing,” she said. During the sometimes heated exchanges in Cambridge, Nuttall was attacked by the other parties for seeking to focus the debate on Islamic extremism and controlling immigration. Nuttall said: “Ukip will always protect those most at risk of wage compression from unskilled mass migration. Ukip will always stand up for those let down by the Westminster elite.” Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party , criticised “people like Paul and his hate-filled rhetoric” and launched a staunch defence of immigration, describing the free movement of people as “the most wonderful gift”. The SNP Robertson said: “This debate shames and demeans us all. I don’t think there anyone who doesn’t understand the positive contribution people have made to this land and demonising those people is totally unacceptable.” Farron, who has put Brexit at the centre of his campaign, repeatedly underlined the importance for the economy of staying in the EU single market. “We need to remain in the single market or we will not be able to afford the NHS and social care,” he said. “If Jeremy cared about having enough money to raise living standards, he would not have trooped through the lobbies with the Conservatives and Ukip to trigger article and make Britain poorer.” The Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, came to support Rudd in the “spin room” in the Cambridge Union. A Conservative spokesman said May was spending the evening in No and refused to say whether she had watched the debate. With just a week to go before polling day, the Tories are keen to stick to the script of focusing on the opportunities presented by Brexit – and contrasting May leadership with Corbyn. Several of the leaders in the debate criticised May decision not to participate. Lucas said: “The first rule of leadership is show up. You don’t call a general election saying it the most important in her lifetime and then not even bother to show up.” In Farron closing statement, he urged voters to make a cup of tea instead of watching Rudd final remarks. “Amber Rudd is up next. She not the prime minister. The prime minister is not here tonight. She can’t be bothered. So why should you? “In fact, Bake Off is on next. Why not make yourself a brew. You’re not worth Theresa May time. Don’t give her yours.” Rudd criticised Corbyn leadership, pointing out that a large number of his own MPs had joined a vote of no confidence against him, and repeating the Conservatives’ attack line that Labour could cooperate with other opposition parties in a “coalition of chaos”. She urged people to support her party “in the quiet of the polling booth”. Corbyn had been due to address large rallies in Swindon and Bristol on Wednesday night, but the Labour frontbenchers Angela Rayner and Jon Ashworth stood in for him. Rayner, the shadow education secretary, told the crowd in Swindon that May was a “plastic Thatcher”, adding: “This prime minister is for turning but not for turning up.”",1131,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/31/corbyn-confronts-rudd-over-spending-cuts-in-fractious-tv-debate

The Hand is left to do the heavy lifting while Maybot reboots That all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Nigel Farage , the former Ukip leader, is claiming the audience was biased against Ukip. He also says BBC executives should be sacked because of this although, if you watch the video of him saying this on his LBC show (instead of just listening), you might detect a smile on his face as he saying this that suggests (at least, it did to me) that he knows he not really being serious at this point. And Ukip has put out a press notice headed: “Powerful and courageous performance by Ukip leader.” It quotes the Ukip deputy leader, Peter Whittle , saying: It clear that Paul Nuttall showed a resolve, courage and leadership that has been lacking from the rest of the Westminster establishment. Paul spoke to people in Britain who are living in the real world. Unlike the others he was honest, direct, and confident about the future of Britain. Despite a blanket of denial from the other speakers, he was prepared to talk about the real threats faced by our society. He was prepared to call out Islamic Extremism for what it is, rather than simply restate the platitudes we are so used to. He was realistic about the impact of immigration on jobs and our public services. The Lib Dem press statement about the debate is causing much merriment. In the wood panelled spin room of the Cambridge Union, the first drama of the night came when Labour Emily Thornberry burst into an interview with Tory cabinet minister Damian Green, live on BBC News. The work and pensions secretary was among several high profile Tories, including Brexit secretary David Davis and culture secretary Karen Bradley, who paced the room, speaking to broadcasters about Amber Rudd performance. But Labour sources said Thornberry had been scheduled to be on Channel News with Green, until Conservatives had told Labour they did not want a two-way debate. Stood down, Thornberry decided to take matters into her own hands and join Green post-debate interview live on air. Lib Dem campaign chiefs declared themselves chuffed with Tim Farron performance, particularly the audience gleeful reception of his final joke - that viewers should switch off for Rudd statement and watch Bake Off instead. “He smashed it,” one source said. Lib Dem president Sal Brinton said Farron had needed to make an impact, given how little he was recognised by the wider public. However, if cheers from the crowd were anything to go by, it was Corbyn who won. Labour sources said the Labour leader had deliberately held back from criticising the prime minister too incessantly for not turning up, intending instead to focus on the message of the party manifesto while smaller parties tore into Rudd. “He the only person in that room who could be prime minister, and so he behaved like one,” a source said. Tory sources pointed out however that the Labour leader had not mentioned Brexit in his opening or closing statements - or in his answer about leadership. “How can you start the negotiations in days time and not mention the biggest issue facing this country?” one said. Labour admitted Corbyn had not mentioned the issue, but said that was a deliberate attempt to have broad resonance. “He said we are fighting for the many not the few, we want a Brexit for the many not the few,” the source said. This is from the BBC Esther Webber. If you’re reading this, you’re a Guardian reader, and that means you featured in tonight debate.

Jeremy Corbyn clearly won the debate. He showed himself as a leader who wants to change the country for the better, to make it work for the many not just a few. By contrast, Theresa May refusal to take part showed her weakness. It a sign of a Tory campaign which is treating the public with contempt, trying to hide from scrutiny. They showed tonight they have no answers to the challenges facing Britain and that they would make pensioners and working people worse off. Tonight proved that Jeremy Corbyn and Labour are the only party that will build a Britain for the many not the few. Updated at BST BBC Debate - Snap verdict Like any content-rich political event – a party conference speech, a budget, a manifesto – a debate offers numerous potential “lines” and it can be hard to work out immediately which ones (if any?) have any lasting significance. And a seven-way debate, to use a technical term employed by the Sunday Times’ Tim Shipman (see , is a clusterfuck. There weren’t any stand-out winners, but most attention was focused on Jeremy Corbyn and he did well. His attack on Paul Nuttall over food banks was one of the highlights of the debate – he was authentic and passionate – and increasingly the CCHQ charge that he is an implausible PM seems to look less convincing. The other main figure on the stage tonight was Amber Rudd . In a six-against-one scenario she seemed to hold up quite credibly, and she wins the message discipline prize of the night (one derided by the media, but important nonetheless) for her constant jibes about Labour money tree. As for the others, Tim Farron had some of the best soundbites of the evening, and his final line about not giving Theresa May your time, because she is not giving hers to you, was one of the best lines of the evening. Caroline Lucas (predictably) and Leanne Wood (a bit less predictably) had some outstanding moments. Their two-pronged attack on Rudd, over the Tories being in coalition with Ukip (see , was particularly effective, and Wood came out with the best put-down of the whole evening when she depicted Nuttall as someone who would try to divorce his wife without paying: “We all know about blokes like you.” (See Angus Robertson was particularly effective when it came to challenging Nuttall on migration. And even Paul Nuttall was better than he was in last week debate, although, as the only leave voter on the panel, it is hard to credit how he ended up representing over of the country. There may not have been a winner, but there was a loser: May herself. Long after we have all forgotten anything that was said last night, we will remember that May did not show up. Earlier I wrote that it seemed to make sense for a PM with a lead in the polls to avoid a debate like this. (See Now I am not so sure. David Cameron managed to wriggle out of one of the debates in but it went ahead without a Conservative and they called it a “challengers’ debate”, as if that was an established constitutional norm. No one particularly noticed that Cameron had stayed at home. But when Rudd tried to answer the question about leadership by praising the abilities of someone who was not even there (see , May absence was transparent – and not particularly explicable. Perhaps voters will decide they don’t mind very much. But if May ratings continue to slide even further, this will inevitably be seen as a contributing factor. Updated at BST Closing statements Nuttall says tonight was like Groundhog Day. Ukip will always be the outsider. But it has been proven right on Brexit, on immigration, on grammar schools, and on protecting services. Lucas says the country stands at at crossroads. One more MP from the other parties. But more Green MPs would be transformative. Corbyn says the real choice is between a Labour government and a Conservative one. Vote Labour for the many, not the few. Robertson says this is about the kind of country we should be. The SNP will always work with others to make the country better. Wood says Plaid is the only party putting Wales on the agenda. But Plaid MPs will stand up for the whole of the UK. She urges people to give them the mandate to allow them to stand up for Wales . Farron says Rudd is coming up next. The PM could not be bothered to turn up. Bake Off is coming up next. Make yourself a brew. You are not worth her time. So don’t give her yours. Rudd says the government needs to be at its strongest to take the UK through Brexit. Only May can do that. And thats it. Verdicts, reaction and a summary coming up next. Updated at BST This is from the Sun Matt Dathan. Robertson says May is the U-turn queen. That is not the leadership we require. He says the SNP are the third party at Westminster, and provide the real opposition, he says. Farron says May should have turned up for the debate. He says he grew up in Preston.

80,"Alex Salmond will argue in court that one of the two sexual harassment cases against him was resolved nearly five years ago, as he continues his legal battle against the Scottish government . The former first minister has asked a judge for a judicial review of the Scottish government handling of the two complaints. He accuses its civil servants of breaching his civil rights by allegedly stopping him from mounting an effective defence. Two formal complaints were made against Salmond in January under a strengthened anti-harassment procedure that was introduced in November last year to protect Scottish civil servants after other, unrelated sexual harassment cases at Westminster and Holyrood. The judicial review is due to be heard over four days in January next year after a procedural hearing next month, the court of session, Scotland civil court, said on Monday. Both complaints against Salmond have been passed to Police Scotland , which is investigating. Salmond legal papers claim that one of the cases of alleged harassment in late was settled informally at the time using the Scottish government fairness at work procedures. Sources close to Salmond said he offered the female civil servant an apology for a “misunderstanding” after the incident at Bute House, the first minister official residence in Edinburgh New Town. Salmond had refused to disclose this information until last weekend, but his advisers claimed his apology was accepted without it being escalated into a formal complaint and investigation. They argued that its re-emergence as a formal complaint four years later was an abuse of process, further undermining the investigation launched in January this year by Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary at the Scottish government. Opposition parties say this admission, which has come from Salmond advisers, raises significant questions about whether his then deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, knew of the incident and that it was dealt with using the civil service procedure. However, Sturgeon office insisted she was unaware of any complaints or concerns about Salmond until April, when he told her about the two harassment cases himself. Under the fairness at work procedures in place in for complaints against ministers, a complainant had the right to have their case formally investigated. That would mean the case was escalated to the deputy first minister, then Sturgeon, and the then permanent secretary. However, Salmond aides claim the incident was resolved through “local, informal handling”, the lowest level of procedure that does not involve any senior civil servants or other ministers. The fairness at work code implies that this level of complaint would not be formally recorded or reported. Had the complainant been unsatisfied with that procedure, the next step would have been to complain in writing to the government head of human resources, who would investigate the case even though it would still be classified as an informal complaint. The final step would be a formal complaint involving Sturgeon and the permanent secretary. The first minister spokesman said: “At no point were any complaints referred to [Sturgeon] under the fairness at work policy when she was deputy first minister. As the Scottish government has already made clear, there are a number of inaccuracies in some of the public statements that have been made and these will be addressed in court,” he said. Rhoda Grant, for Scottish Labour, said a minister needed to make a full statement on this new disclosure in Holyrood this week. “It is absolutely essential that the complaints procedure – and the timeline to this point, including who knew what and when – are clear and transparent,” she said. “Without that transparency, people are less likely to want to come forward and press their case.” “The SNP government is in danger of throwing up a smokescreen around this situation and eroding public trust in this process.” Sturgeon spokesman said it was not possible to address Holyrood on the case for legal reasons.",647,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/01/alex-salmond-advisers-claim-sexual-harassment-case-was-resolved-in-2013
81,"Jeremy Corbyn has insisted that he was not negotiating Brexit during what he described as a “useful” meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator. Before the meeting took place Nigel Farage , the former Ukip leader, claimed the meeting was an “clearly an attempt to undermine negotiations after [Corbyn] promised to vote down May deal”. (See Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has warned the EU that the UK will “not keep coming back” to the negotiating table with more Brexit proposals. Speaking to Sky News, he said that Theresa May had already put forward “sensible proposals” and said the time was now for engagement from the EU. He said: We cannot have a situation in the negotiation between a sovereign power like Britain and one of the biggest countries in the EU and the EU where every time we come up with a proposal, instead of engaging with that proposal they simply say, ‘I’m sorry that doesn’t work come back with something else’. Negotiations require two parties to engage seriously, that hasn’t been happening and Britain is not going to keep coming back with more. We have put on the table some practical proposals, which mean that we can honour the spirit and letter of the referendum and reassure businesses that they can have the frictionless trade that they want. They’re sensible proposals, we now need some engagement from the EU. As my colleague Patrick Wintour reports, Hunt also said having another Brexit referendum would fuel cynicism. Northern Ireland faces blackouts and drastic electricity price rises in the event of a no-deal Brexit, leaked government documents reveal. Brexiters have been left “flabbergasted” by the EU refusal to back down in divorce talks because the UK has never understood that the single market is seen as vital to the political, as well as economic, stability of the continent, according to the European commission vice-president. As Patrick Wintour reports, Frans Timmermans also expressed the hope that the UK might yet change its mind on Brexit now it “has seen the facts”. There had been no intention to humiliate Theresa May at the recent Salzburg summit, he said.But he added that the British prime minister had no reason to be surprised by the EU negotiating stance since “she had been told time and time again” by the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that her Chequers proposals were unacceptable. Place Jo Cox has been inaugurated to the melancholic chords of a Balkan folk song and the anti-apartheid hymn Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika as Brussels honoured the murdered MP in a ceremony attended by her family and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. That all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at BST This is from the BBC Adam Fleming. Corbyn says he was not negotiating Brexit during meeting with Barnier Jeremy Corbyn has finished briefing journalists following the meeting that he and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, had with Michel Barnier , the EU chief Brexit negotiator. The Press Association has filed the best quotes, and here are the key quotes. Corbyn said he was not negotiating with Barnier, just setting out Labour position. Explaining what happened at the meeting, he said: We’ve had an interesting, useful discussion with Mr Barnier. We have set out the views of the Labour party surrounding Brexit following the conference speeches made by Keir Starmer and myself. We are obviously not negotiating. We are not in government, we are the opposition. But he was interested to know what our views are and the six tests we have laid down by which we will hold our government in future. He said Barnier did not express a view as to whether he preferred Labour Brexit stance to Theresa May. When asked if Barnier said the Labour vision of Brexit was acceptable to him, Corbyn replied: [Barnier] made no opinion on this. It not a negotiation, it us informing him of what our views are and he telling us what the state of play was on the negotiations. Asked if Barnier gave any indication that Labour plan would be easier to implement than the Chequers plan, Mr Corbyn replied: He didn’t offer and we didn’t ask him for opinions on that because that would be going over the line. What we did was set out our views and then he set out in broad terms what the progress is and what the timetable is. He did not rule out delaying article Asked if this would be necessary if there were an election or a second referendum, Corbyn said: Obviously it would depend when the election is, what the scenario would be. We would want to maintain the relationship with Europe around the six tests. He would not say who called the meeting, but said that he had met Barnier on a number of occasions and that they had an “informal arrangement” to try to meet whenever they were in Brussels at the same time. This is from the BBC Adam Fleming. Jeremy Corbyn is being questioned by journalists about now, the Independent Jon Stone reports. Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, has tweeted this about his meeting this afternoon with Jeremy Corbyn . Peter Foster , the Telegraph Europe editor, thinks Barnier motives may not be as innocent as he claims. Given that Theresa May negotiating credibility depends on what she can get through parliament, anything Barnier picks up about Labour positioning could have a bearing on what the EU decides to offer. Voters trust more than on key election issues, poll suggests We’ve got some new Guardian/ICM polling. It mostly about key issues facing Britain, and which of the two main parties, and leaders, are trusted most to do the best job. The polling was carried out last weekend, as the Labour conference was just starting, and so the results give a snapshot of where the parties and leaders stood at the end of the summer. Party conferences do have an effect on poll ratings, particularly in the short term, and so if there was another poll this weekend, or next weekend, the results might be a bit different. But these figures give a good insight into what has, and has not, changed over the last six months. Labour is seen as the most trusted party on six of the issues featured in the poll. They are (in order of their lead): improving public services; the NHS; making Britain fairer; pensioners; eduction and the environment. The Tories are ahead on four, which are (in order of their lead): immigration; security; the economy and Brexit. This list includes the issue currently seen by voters as the most important one facing the country (Brexit) and the one that is conventionally seen as crucial to electoral success (the economy). We last asked this question in February. As ICM Alex Turk says, there has not been much change since then, but in areas where there has been change, mostly the Conservatives have been gaining. He says: While there have not been large shifts in the perceptions of the parties, we can see that compared to February, Labour have a reduced lead over the Conservatives in pretty much all key policy areas. The only exception is on negotiating a good Brexit deal for the UK, were Labour now lag behind the Conservatives by percentage points, rather than The biggest change since February has been on the NHS. In February Labour had a lead in this area, but now that is down to points - presumably because Theresa May decision to announce a longterm spending boost for the NHS has registered. The Conservative lead over Labour as the best part to handle Brexit has fallen over the summer, the poll suggests. But the Labour lead over the Tories on the NHS has reduced more sharply over the same period. Here is a graphic with the details. And here is a chart with the numbers. Jeremy Corbyn is ahead of Theresa May on the same six issues, when the question about who is trusted most is framed in terms of leaders, not parties, but generally Corbyn does not perform as well against May as Labour does against the Tories . We last asked this question in July. Since then May has been improving her standing compared to Corbyn in seven out of the areas, although generally not by much. The biggest change has been in ‘making Britain fairer’, where Corbyn lead has dropped from points to seven. Here is a graphic with the details. And here is a chart with the numbers. Voters trust Labour more than Corbyn on key election issues, the poll suggests. Having Conservative v Labour, as well as May v Corbyn data, allows us to work out whether each side does best when issues are framed in terms of party, or in terms of leader. And, despite the enthusiasm that Corbyn inspires amongst activists, these figures suggest that amongst voters as a whole Corbyn is not an electoral asset. He is not a big liability, but the party appeal is stronger. This chart shows, on each of the issues, whether May and Corbyn are more trusted, or less trusted, than their party. For example, on Brexit, trust the Tories (v Labour) but trust May (v Corbyn), giving May a net score of May outperforms her party on three issues (improving public services, security and making Britain fairer), scores the same on three issues, and comes behind on four. Corbyn matches his party on just one issue (the environment), and underperforms his party on all nine others. He is most behind on improving public services, where trust Labour, and trust him, giving him a net score of This may seem perverse; Corbyn has campaigned much more on public services than May. But the Labour party as a whole is seen as being very strong on public services, and Corbyn can’t quite match that. May outperforms her party on this because, for the Tories as a whole, it a weak spot. These findings may help to explain why Corbyn does not feature very prominently in Labour new, and widely admired, campaign video. See We also asked our regular voting intention question. The results are probably a bit out of date, because Labour conference may have shifted views a bit, but here they are anyway. Conservatives: (down compared to ICM two weeks before) Labour: (up Lib Dems: (up Ukip: (no change) Greens: (no change) The tables will go up later on the ICM website. I will post an update here with the link when they are available. ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of adults aged between and September Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. UPDATE: Here are the tables (pdf). Updated at BST Treasury minister says Tories should learn from campaign videos Severin Carrell Liz Truss , the chief secretary to the Treasury, has said the Conservatives risk losing the next general election because, she said, some Tories underestimate how slick Labour campaigning machine has become. Speaking at an event organised by the centre right think tank Reform Scotland on Thursday, Truss said the Tories had to prove to voters they had turned the economy around, warning: It not about attacking the opposition: oppositions don’t win elections; governments lose them. Truss had been asked by a Tory student called Daniel whether she had seen Labour latest party political broadcast. He said the PPB was based in a northern English town and “was, sadly, a fantastic piece of film”. It focused on questions such as “regeneration, renewal, ‘we’ve been left behind’, ‘jobs have gone overseas’.” Describing that as “quite a bold [pro-Brexit] message”, the student asked Truss how the Tories could effectively counter this “cheap populist slogans” from Labour . Truss replied: First of all: I agree with you it is a serious threat. I don’t buy people that say Labour is not a serious threat. They have got more professional. I have seen quite a lot of their videos; I think they’re very good. And also I don’t denigrate populism because democracies are fundamentally populist. People vote for what they like. So we’ve got to be careful about saying that we don’t want to be populist. I mean we want to be popular. And we have to go with the grain of what people are thinking. It sounds to me that what you’re saying about that video does capture the heart of where we need to be as a party. So we need to be talking about how people lives are getting better. But PR [successful public relations] follows real progress. So you can’t communicate a message if it isn’t true. If the economy is sluggish at the next election and the Tories are seen as not having turned things around, we will open ourselves up to losing the next election. It not about attacking the opposition: oppositions don’t win elections; governments lose them. So for me its about how do we turbo charge the economy post-Brexit? What bolder things can we do to make sure we are on the right track. [So] running attack ads on Labour and scaring people, I don’t think will work and I think that was one of our problems in the election. Severin Carrell Liz Truss , the chief secretary to the Treasury, has hinted that English local councils may get more generous government funding or see an end to real terms cuts to their funding. After a speaking event in Edinburgh, Truss was asked about complaints from Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, that local council funding cuts had gone too far and needed to be halted. (See Street, who is due to give the opening speech at the Tories annual conference in Birmingham on Sunday, told the Birmingham Mail “the cuts have gone far enough. It not reasonable to expect that this continues.” He was echoing complaints from many council leaders in the West Midlands, and elsewhere in England, including from Tory led administrations in Somerset and elsewhere. Truss told the Guardian she believed the UK government had been right to ask councils to raise more locally. She said changing “the balance of local funding” from central to local government increased their accountability. She went on: Now of course going into the spending review, which is next year, and the local government finance settlement at the end of this year, we need to make sure that local councils have the wherewithal that they need. And what we have already done is given more flexibility in terms of council tax. But I can’t pre-announce what going to happen with the local government funding settlement or the spending review. Of course I am in regular discussion with local government, listening to what they have to say and we will need to look at that in the local government finance settlement and the spending review, but I can’t make any announcements now. Quizzed about Amber Rudd remarks to Robert Peston on ITV on Thursday night that Tory MPs were willing to revolt on the final Brexit deal if it involved a Canada-style free trade arrangement, Truss insisted Theresa May would secure a good deal. She said: The prime minister is well aware of the views of the Conservative parliamentary party; she is the person charged with getting a deal. It is a tough thing to do but she is doing a very good job of that. I’m convinced she will secure a deal that can command the support both of the European Union and of the parliamentary party. Updated at BST This is from Sky Mark Stone. The Times’ Bruno Waterfield has a picture of Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, arriving at the European commission HQ for their meeting with Michel Barnier , the EU chief Brexit negotiator. Selmayr is Martin Selmayr, the secretary general of the commission (its most senior office - ie, the commission cabinet secretary). Corbyn had been expected to meet him, but at a briefing this morning a spokesman said he was not aware that there would be a meeting between the two men. Tories rule out striking Brexit deal in line with demands In his speech to the Labour conference yesterday Jeremy Corbyn made a direct offer to Theresa May: negotiate a Brexit deal on Labour terms, and Labour will back it, he said. Today we’ve had an official response from the Conservatives. And it a no. Brandon Lewis, the Tory chairman, turned down Corbyn offer in an interview with the Evening Standard. He said: Look, I would hope the Labour party and all parliamentarians would back the prime minister deal. The problem with what Labour outlined is that would not allow us to do global trade deals and therefore doesn’t respect the referendum. This won’t come as much of a surprise to Corbyn, who was probably motivated in what he said more by the desire to show that Labour is not blocking Brexit than by any expectation that May was going to agree. (Corbyn said Labour would back a deal including a customs union with the EU, something May has directly ruled out and something that would be anathema to many of her MPs.) In his Standard interview, Lewis also claimed that the Conservative party membership was “actually ... quite supportive” of May Chequers plan - despite a ConservativeHome survey suggesting that only of members want her to persist with the proposal. He also revealed that, at the conference starting this weekend, the party will unveil an interactive conference app which will allow people to provide feedback during cabinet minister speeches. In the circumstances, that could turn out to be a brave move. And here is the statement issued by Jeremy Corbyn after the memorial event for Jo Cox in Brussels. He said: Today is a difficult day for Jo family and friends. And it is a difficult day for Jo friends and colleagues in the Labour party, who also knew and loved Jo, and who mourn her passing. I would like to thank Jo family for inviting me here to pay tribute to Jo on behalf of the Labour party. And I would like to thank you, the people of Brussels, for this wonderful gesture, which will allow Jo legacy to live on in a city that she loved. In Jo memory, we must recommit to the values of peace and justice that Jo fought for every day. We must stand up for the values of internationalism, the values of reaching out to support those in need all across the world. We will never forget Jo. In her memory let us build a better world. of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Amber Rudd Jeremy Corbyn European Union Scottish National party (SNP) Frances",3162,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/27/may-faces-revolt-from-40-tory-mps-if-she-opts-for-canada-brexit-deal-rudd-says-politics-live
82,"Scotland auditor general has said Nicola Sturgeon government needs to be more open about its loans to private firms following a row about a bailout for a Glasgow-based shipbuilder. Caroline Gardner said the Scottish government needed to produce clear rules on how and when it would lend money to businesses, as well as publish clear accounts covering all public spending in Scotland . Her intervention follows the disclosure that ministers in Edinburgh have lent in two tranches to Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd (FMEL), which is building two new ferries for the state-owned ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne. Opposition parties have been critical of the loans because FMEL is owned by Jim McColl, a multi-millionaire tax exile and business adviser to the Scottish government. He has previously campaigned in support of Alex Salmond demands for greater financial independence for Scotland, and Salmond supported McColl buyout of FMEL before the independence referendum. McColl said he was not a Scottish National party member and that one of the loans was needed partly to help cover the extra costs of contract changes for the ferries. The loans carry commercial interest rates. Sturgeon has used FMELs shipyard near Greenock for election campaigning , and opposition parties say ministers failed to be transparent about the case for the loans. Gardner indicated she too was unhappy about the handling of the Ferguson loans and other Scottish government loans to the offshore engineering firm BiFab, which was threatened with closure until a government-backed rescue. The Scottish government “needs to be more transparent about its overall approach to providing loans to private companies and develop a clear framework to guide its decision-making around how it invests public money”, she said in her report on this year Scottish government consolidated accounts. The accounts showed the Scottish government underspent its budget by That involved an underspend of in its budgets for day to day spending and a underspend in its budgets for building projects. Gardner again chastised ministers for not yet producing full accounts for all public spending in Scotland, despite repeated pledges to do so. She said publishing full accounts that set out the government liabilities and its assets, ranging from pensions liabilities through to the value of its historic buildings, was essential in allowing proper scrutiny of spending and policies. In its introduction to its assessment of this year accounts, Audit Scotland said: “The Scottish budget is now more complex and is subject to greater uncertainty and volatility as a result of new tax and borrowing powers arising from the Scotland Acts in and “The increasing uncertainty over the impact of the UK withdrawal from the European Union adds further complexity and risk to the Scottish government finances as it makes choices over spending and levels of tax and borrowing. “Comprehensive, transparent and timely reporting of the Scottish government budget and financial performance has never been more important in this new environment.” Kate Forbes, the Scottish government public finance minister, implied they would take her criticisms on board. “We will continue to work with the Scottish parliament and key stakeholders as we take forward the parliament new budget process, which will enable increased scrutiny of our budget process,” she said.",530,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/27/scottish-government-loans-to-businesses-auditor-general
83,"Alex Salmond has closed a crowdfunding appeal to fund a judicial review of the Scottish government handling of sexual harassment allegations against him after it reached more than double its initial target in less than three days. By Saturday lunchtime, more than people had donated a total of to Salmond after he launched the appeal on Wednesday evening. The former Scottish National party leader faces a police investigation into the complaints by two female civil servants. One official is reported to have alleged he touched her bottom and breasts at his official residence in Edinburgh while he was first minister. Salmond has repeatedly denied any misconduct. Closing the appeal, Salmond posted a message thanking those who had contributed and stating: “Every penny of surplus funds, which will be substantial in the event of a successful judicial review, will be distributed to good causes in Scotland and beyond.” While a number of senior party figures have questioned why someone with Salmond evident resources would require fundraising, and suggested that such a public rallying for a man accused of harassment may deter other women from coming forward with complaints, a handful of SNP MPs and MSPs have donated themselves. Meanwhile the SNP is attempting to refocus on its primary goal of independence after a turbulent week and a warning from its leader, Nicola Sturgeon , that the way the allegations made against Salmond are dealt with “will say a lot about who we are as a party”. Can the SNP survive the mess of Salmondgate? | Ruth Wishart Hundred of activists are gathering in Aviemore on Saturday to debate the economic case for independence. At a meeting of SNP parliamentarians on Friday, arranged before the Salmond allegations were made public, Sturgeon said: “How we deal with this and how we are seen to respond to this will say a lot about who we are as a party and also about the country we are today and want to build for the future. “Let not forget that at the heart of this, amidst all the focus on process, politics and personalities, there are two people who have brought forward complaints, which cannot have been easy to do. I want to be not just the first minister but also a citizen of a country where people feel that they can come forward and know that their complaints will be taken seriously. “Therefore in everything we do and say, we need to make sure that we are not making it harder for people to come forward in the future. Otherwise we risk setting back so much of the progress that has been made in recent times.” The event in Aviemore is the second of a series of national assemblies set up to discuss the report by the party sustainable growth commission , published in May. Party sources downplayed talk of a rift on Saturday morning, insisting that rank-and-file members attending last weekend assembly in Ayr had been more interested in talking about currency options than Alex Salmond. The SNP deputy leader, Keith Brown, who is facilitating the open-format assemblies, which allow individual members to offer feedback on all aspects of the report economic prospectus for independence as well as how the party conveys its message to voters, said that providing an alternative to Brexit was essential, as voters began to notice mortgages and food prices increasing while job opportunities diminished. “A fresh case for independence is more vital than ever – and that is what we are working on at the national assemblies, and with wider engagement enabling members of our party [to give] direct input and [giving] people from across the yes movement and civic Scotland a say too.” The long-awaited growth commission report was intended to offer a more convincing and realistic economic case for independence than the one thought to have scuppered the campaign. But it attracted a wave of criticism from members of the broader yes movement following its publication earlier this year, in particular for recommendations that an independent Scotland would have to cut spending and delay launching its own currency, leave a newly independent Scotland beholden to the UK financial markets. Sturgeon cautionary words were echoed by the prominent civil society group Women for Independence, which released a statement on Friday evening urging all media outlets and social media users to be mindful of their responsibilities towards survivors of sexual crimes, saying: “It vital that everyone remembers that there are survivors of sexual crimes who are reading and hearing everything that is being played out in the media. Their voices are lost this week.”",765,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/01/snp-seeks-to-refocus-on-policies-amid-salmond-allegations
84,"Senior Scottish National party politicians have defended Nicola Sturgeon handling of the harassment allegations against Alex Salmond and downplayed a bitter rift inside the party. Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, offered Sturgeon his unequivocal support as it emerged that some of his MPs had made donat ions to a legal fund set up by Salmond after he quit the party on Wednesday. Alex Salmond is using crowdfunding to signal his power. That wrong | Suzanne Moore “In trying and difficult circumstances I think the first minister has shown tremendous dignity and first class leadership,” Blackford said. Nearly people had donated about to Salmond by Thursday afternoon after he appealed for support to mount his legal challenge against the Scottish government handling of allegations of sexual harassment against him. Sturgeon again strongly defended the decision to investigate the claims against Salmond. She told the BBC it was important to uphold the SNP traditions of campaigning “for fairness, for equality and for the notion we shouldn’t have one rule for the powerful and another rule for everybody else”. Salmond resignation from the party which he had led to successive Scottish election victories and an independence referendum risked sparking a battle within the party. Sturgeon is scheduled to address a joint meeting of her MPs and MSPs in Edinburgh on Friday at their annual away day to discuss policy and strategy. Holyrood resumes after the summer recess next week, when Sturgeon is due to publish her programme for government, which now risks being overshadowed by the Salmond controversy. Some activists, backed by a handful of SNP parliamentarians, have berated Sturgeon on social media and circulated conspiracy theories about the investigation. Several SNP parliamentarians have donated to Salmond fund. The former SNP leader faces a police investigation into the complaints by two female civil servants. One official is said to have alleged he touched her bottom and breasts at his official residence in Edinburgh while he was first minister. Salmond has repeatedly denied any misconduct. “Let me be clear again,” he said. “I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality.” Blackford told reporters in Edinburgh on Thursday he was deeply saddened by the controversy and the allegations, but said Sturgeon conduct in defending the complaints process had been faultless. He said the interests of victims of sexual harassment had to be paramount, regardless of the seniority of the accused, and downplayed the scale of the internal revolt against Sturgeon. “I’m not getting messages from people suggesting there is civil war inside the SNP. Far from it,” he said. “There is strong support for the first minister, for the government, from parliamentarians and from party members. “Of course, you are always going to get the noise from social media … but I would simply say you need to keep things in context.” Earlier on Thursday, Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister and a former party chief executive under Salmond, said he also stood “four square” behind Sturgeon. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the First Division Association, which represents the UK senior civil servants, accused Salmond of “nasty, vindictive and deliberate” attacks on the integrity of Leslie Evans, the Scottish government permanent secretary. Salmond has repeatedly accused Evans of using an unlawful and unfair process to investigate the allegations and has launched a judicial review in Scotland civil courts. Other SNP parliamentarians have told the Guardian they support Sturgeon, and said the party needed to focus on its policies, Brexit, the party annual conference in Glasgow in October and her planned statement on plans for a new independence referendum. There are concerns that Salmond has far greater freedom to speak publicly about his legal battle than Sturgeon, who is constrained by the demands of the legal process. The controversy erupted late last week after Evans told Salmond she was planning to publish a statement disclosing the fact that he had been under investigation. Salmond lawyers threatened the Scottish government with an interdict. Salmond insists he was promised confidentiality by Evans and was denied the chance to call his own witnesses. He dropped that threat after Evans withdrew the planned statement, but details of the inquiry were leaked to the Daily Record. Salmond has offered no evidence that the original leak came from within the Scottish government. Some sources suggest one of the complainants has left the civil service.",731,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/30/snp-politicians-praise-sturgeons-dignity-in-salmond-case
85,"The Scottish National party away day for MPs, MSPs and MEPs is an annual fixture of the political calendar. But Friday joint parliamentary meeting, to be held at Napier University in Edinburgh, is certain to be dominated by one topic. Alex Salmond dramatic resignation from the SNP, the party he led across three decades, turning it into a powerful electoral force and coming close to delivering a yes vote to independence in is the latest shockwave to hit Scotland governing party. Alex Salmond is using crowdfunding to signal his power. That wrong | Suzanne Moore A week after the former first minister launched an unprecedented judicial review of the Scottish government handling of two sexual misconduct complaints made against him, it is hard to avoid talk of a major split within the party as well as potentially seismic repercussions for the pro-independence movement itself. Observers of every stripe acknowledge Salmond continuing capacity to direct the news agenda with his usual hyperbolic flourish, but many also express deep regret that the discussion has already moved so far from where it began: two women allegations that he sexually harassed them while he was first minister, complaints that have now been referred to the police. In his resignation statement, which Salmond released alongside a crowdfunding appeal to support his legal action, he said he was “conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division”. Beyond the retweeting of either Salmond or Nicola Sturgeon statements on the matter, it is notable how quiet SNP MPs and MSPs – well known for their embrace of social media – have been since the allegations emerged. SNP MPs donate to Alex Salmond legal fund over harassment claims But the fact that a man with his evident resources was still able to reach his target within hours of launching the appeal is evidence of the loyalty Salmond commands, among senior figures but also rank and file party members and across the wider yes movement – and of how speedily he can mobilise it. Sturgeon may contemplate this as she prepares to update Holyrood on her position regarding a second independence referendum this autumn – something Salmond has taken a less gradualist position on. On their public reticence, SNP parliamentarians will say privately that there is a collective willingness not to stoke the fire of speculation while investigations and legal action are ongoing. This is helped by a pragmatic recognition that the party has achieved much more in recent years as a broadly unified party, as well as the personal esteem that Sturgeon is held in. But there are also those who underline the serious disquiet among some colleagues at what they consider to be a lack of due process in the handling of sexual harassment complaints – including those which led to the resignation from the party of the former minister Mark McDonald in March – and a culture of leaking to the media. Affection for Salmond is by no means universal, but he is frequently characterised as a “rough diamond” or a “street fighter”, even by those who insist he should not be above the law. And there are those who insist that the spotlight must return to women. One prominent Scottish feminist, Claire Heuchan, questioned on Thursday how many people donating money to Salmond fighting fund had thought about how it would affect women who have been sexually assaulted, or how it might discourage women from coming forward in the future. Others noted that Salmond hashtag #forfairness appeared to imply that those bringing the complaints were somehow being underhand. Questions about the professional links of the husband of Leslie Evans, the country most senior civil servant, whose handling of the allegations Salmond is challenging, have left many women shaking their heads in despair about the progress of gender equality in Scottish public life. A consideration of the wider impact on female voters may well be crucial to the longer-term health of the independence movement. Throughout the Scottish independence campaign, much time was spent analysing why many women were unconvinced by the yes message, and how best to win them over. Groups such as Women for Independence heard from women who said they were turned off by a largely male-dominated debate. As the national coordinator Margaret Young told the Guardian this year: “What we found was not that women were risk-averse but that they didn’t believe there would be any change with independence because it would still be about people, mainly men, shouting and point-scoring whether in the newspaper, on television or on social media.”",765,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/30/alex-salmond-resignation-could-have-seismic-repercussions
86,"SNP MPs are helping fund Alex Salmond legal challenge against the Scottish government handling of sexual harassment allegations, as the leader of a civil servants’ union condemned his remarks towards a senior government official. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, which represents the UK senior civil servants, accused the former nationalist leader of “nasty, vindictive and deliberate” attacks on the integrity of Leslie Evans, the Scottish government permanent secretary. Salmond has repeatedly accused Evans of using an unlawful and unfair procedure to investigate allegations by two women that he sexually harassed them while he was first minister, and has launched a judicial review in Scotland civil courts. Alex Salmond is using crowdfunding to signal his power. That wrong | Suzanne Moore In a dramatic escalation of the dispute on Wednesday, Salmond announced that he had resigned his SNP membership and launched an online appeal to raise towards his legal costs. By Thursday morning, the amount pledged had reached more than One SNP MP confirmed to the Guardian that they had contributed to Salmond appeal, while a tweet from another, Angus MacNeil, appeared to welcome the initiative, exposing a deepening split within the party. Some MPs have accused SNP headquarters, which is run by the chief executive, Peter Murrell – the husband of the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon – of being arrogant and dictatorial. MacNeil retweeted one attack on the party executive that said: “Can’t help but think this is a terrible indictment of the SNP disciplinary culture. Innocent until proven guilty .” One senior SNP figure said anger was growing over Salmond treatment, in particular at the leaking of details of the complaints. Another senior figure described the party leadership as “autocratic”. The accusations, believed to include claims that Salmond touched the bottom and breasts of one official after telling her to get on to a bed at his official residence, have been passed to Police Scotland for investigation. Mike Russell, a longstanding colleague of Salmond who is now Sturgeon constitutional relations minister, told BBC Radio Scotland he was “tremendously sad” about Salmond resignation. But Russell, who was the SNP chief executive during Salmond first period as party leader in the said he stood “foursquare” behind the government handling of the affair. Evans was preparing to publish a statement disclosing the fact that Salmond had been under investigation last week, before Salmond lawyers threatened the Scottish government with an interdict. Salmond insists he was promised confidentiality by Evans and was denied the chance to call his own witnesses. He dropped that threat after Evans withdrew the planned statement, but details of the inquiry were leaked to the Daily Record. Salmond has offered no evidence that the original leak came from within the Scottish government. Some sources suggest one of the complainants has left the civil service. Holyrood must focus on the Alex Salmond harassment claims, not point-scoring | Dani Garavelli Shaken by the crisis around Salmond, Sturgeon has repeatedly defended Evans and the anti-harassment process under which he was investigated. She said again on Thursday that allegations of this type “must be investigated without fear or favour, regardless of the seniority of the person involved”. Salmond has repeatedly denied any misconduct, and pointed out that until January, there had never been any complaint about his behaviour at the Scottish government. “Let me be clear again,” he said. “I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality.” Writing in the Times, Penman said Salmond was attacking the integrity and neutrality of the civil service to promote his personal agenda. “Amid outlandish conspiracy theories are responses from politicians echoing his witch-hunt narrative – gutter politics at its very worst,” Penman said. “While accused of sexual harassment, a claim he denies, Mr Salmond attacks and threatens with legal action the individual tasked with investigating those complaints. “As a former first minister, he knows Ms Evans is duty-bound to investigate complaints. Not only is this nasty, vindictive and deliberate, it also has broader consequences. “What message does this send to those tasked with investigating complaints, let alone the real victims here? Mr Salmond actions undermine the integrity and impartiality of the civil service, thereby damaging the Scottish government itself. Clearly, it a price he believes is worth paying.” Earlier this week, the main civil service unions – the PCS, FDA and Prospect – issued a joint statement backing Evans’ handling of the investigation and the complaints process, which they said protected the rights of government staff. Lynn Henderson, the Scottish national officer for the PCS, said: “While we can’t comment on the detail because there a legal process under way, I want to reiterate that all workers have the right to go to work without fear of harassment be it sexual, or otherwise. “Any kind of behaviour that undermines these basic rights of working people will not be tolerated by our unions.”",816,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/30/alex-salmond-sexual-harassment-claims-scottish-government-snp
87,"Boris Johnson has savaged Theresa May Chequers plan as he made a direct pitch to the Tory faithful for his own domestic policy agenda based on traditional “one nation” Conservative values. People seeking British citizenship are to face tougher English-language requirements after Brexit, Sajid Javid, the home secretary has said . EU citizens will no longer be given priority to live and work in Britain in a radical overhaul of immigration policy after Brexit, Theresa May has said, admitting Britons may in turn have to apply for US-style visas to visit and work in Europe. Senior EU figures have attacked Theresa May post-Brexit immigration plan, with the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, signalling that he expects a row with the British prime minister at an upcoming “moment of truth” summit. Javid has said that he does not mind knowing that his own father would not have been able to come to the UK under the immigration plans announced today that will block entry for low-skilled workers. Javid father came to the UK from Pakistan, although the low-skilled workers affected by the new policy are those from the EU who can currently come to the UK under freedom of movement rules. (See The Democratic Unionist party has threatened to pull the plug on Theresa May government, warning it is not bluffing when it says it will not accept a border in the Irish Sea. Every couple in England and Wales will in future be able to choose between a civil partnership and marriage when they formalise their relationship, the prime minister has announced. That all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at BST Viner ends with a quickfire round, but as they get to the end Javid starts to equivocate. Q: Paul Dacre or Geordie Grieg? Javid says they are both good men. Q: Obama or Trump? Javid says he respects the current president, but would rather have a drink with Obama I respect the current president of the United States. But he says he would rather a drink with Obama Q: Dominic Grieve or Dominic Cummings? Dominic Raab, says Javid. And that it. Q: What do you think of Bob Blackman, the Tory MP accused for various reasons of being Islamophobic? Javid says he does not accept that characterisation of Blackman. He is a great person, he says. He says he does not think there is a racist bone in Blackman body. He says Blackman loves his constituents. Updated at BST Q: Why did you decide it would be acceptable for two jihadists who had been British citizens to face the death penalty in the US? Javid says the government is opposed to the death penalty. That has not changed. He says the case in question is still going through the courts. He cannot get into the facts of this case. He says he will do everything he can to protect the UK. Updated at BST Turning to Grenfell, Javid says he did not want to tell survivors they would have to move into new homes if they were not ready for that yet. He says John Healey, his opposite number, exploited this politically. Q: But some families have not moved into permanent housing yet? But what do you do if they are not happy with what they are offered? He cites as an example a family moving into a home, but then deciding they did not want to be within sight of the tower. Or a family wanting to take time to see if a new school worked out. Updated at BST Javid says he accepts that people are angry about not being able to afford homes. There is a problem with the housing market, he says. It will take a long time to fix. Nationalisation won’t help with that, he says. Q: Is it tough being a millennial? Of course, says Javid. He has teenage children. He knows the challenges. He says some of mortgage transactions involve help from the bank of mum and dad. Q: How do you do it? There is only one way, says Javid: build more homes. Q: How about limiting the number of second homes? Javid says he has looked at that. (He used to be communities secretary, in charge of housing.) But it would only make a difference at the margin. The only solution is to build more homes. He says rent controls (as proposed by Labour) would be disastrous. Q: What do millennials do in the meantime? It will take time, he says. But he says anyone who says price controls or rent controls are the answer is “mad”. Or if they are not mad, they are misleading people, he says. Javid says rent controls would be “mad”. Javid says that Jeremy Cobryn is “completely deluded”, but that he believes in what he says. Javid says some people think the rich are not paying enough tax. But the richest are paying almost of income tax. Q: That because they are earning more? Javid says they have always earned more. That is why they are the top Q: Is laissez-faire economics going out of fashion? Javid says the case needs to be made again. Q: So you don’t think it a disgrace that no banker went to jail? Of course any banker who breaks the law should get jailed. He says Fred Goodwin, and the fact that he got his pension , was a disgrace. But he did not break the law, Javid says. RBS had a balance sheet bigger than the economy. The government did not regulate it properly. Labour were giving him gongs. What happened was outrageous. But to say he should go to jail would be wrong, Javid implies, because he did not break the law. Updated at BST Q: What did the financial crash look like as a banker? It was very worrying, Javid says. He says this was one of the things that inspired him to go into politics. He thought he had something to contribute. There should be people in politics who understood finance, he thought. Q: How do you think Labour handled the crash? It was a very difficult situation, he says. He says there were one or two things he would have done differently. But by and large “they tried to handle it the best they could”. Q: Boris Johnson said today it was a disgrace that no banker went to jail. Javid says people should to go to jail if they break the law. He says the deregulation that took place in the Blair/Brown years did not help, and going into the crash with a big deficit did not help, he says. He says Australia managed its finances better. So the impact there was less, he says. Updated at BST Q: Is it hard to understand ordinary people when you are so wealthy? Javid says he does not think so. He has met some very wealthy people who have a good understanding of others. It is background and values that allow you to understand others. He gets a round of applause for this. Viner says she has been reading about Javid background. Q: It is said that at the age of you borrowed to invest in shares and read the Financial Times. That right, says Javid. Q: And it is said at university you formed a rightwing guerrilla fighting force in student politics with Robert Halfon and Tim Montgomerie. That more or less right, says Javid. Q: Is it true that you read passages from Ayn Rand to your wife on your honeymoon? Javid says he has read a scene out to his wife. The courtroom scene. But it may not have been on his honeymoon; it may have been when they were planning it. Q: It is said you were earning a year as a banker and took a pay cut to become an MP. Javid says he won’t comment on his salary, that “speculation”, but he did take a pay cut to become an MP. Updated at BST Q: Under this policy, your father would not have been allowed into the UK. Javid says he has thought about this. At the time there was a route for people like him to come to Britain. He lived in a Pakistani village, and he remembers people coming to the village encouraging that type of immigration because that is what the UK needed. Q: Does it make you sad that he would not qualify now? No, says Javid. He says he is optimistic about the future. He says the referendum result was not a decision by the British people to turn their back on the world. It was a vote to take back control of immigration, not to shut people out. Updated at BST Q: How will the UK be able to cope without unskilled labour from the EU? Javid says policy should be based on evidence. Amber Rudd asked the Migration Advisory Committee to report on this. It did, earlier in the month. He says the committee found that low-skilled immigration may increase GDP, but it did not improve GDP per head, or productivity. He says more details of the new policy will be set out in the forthcoming white paper. He is “absolutely confident” that the new system will meet the needs of the economy. Updated at BST Q: What is the difference between a hostile environment policy [Theresa May term] and a compliant environment policy [the term used by the Home Office now]? Javid says he understands the term compliant environment policy. He does not really know what a hostile environment policy means. He says he does not like the word “hostile” in this context. It sounds harsh.

88,"Theresa May has failed to challenge the position taken by the EU on the Irish border, allowing it to become “a decisive factor” in the Brexit negotiations, according to the hard Brexit European Research Group, which has been discussing whether to attempt to unseat the prime minister. As Dan Sabbagh and Lisa O’Carroll report, a position paper on the future of the Irish border, presented by David Davis and a string of Tories hostile to May Chequers plan, concedes that the UK will have to sign up to “equivalence of UK and EU regulations” for food products and standards. But it claims it will be possible to do that by the UK and EU maintaining a system of customs checks away from the border . The paper says: “Repetitive trade is well suited to established technical solutions and simplified customs procedures already available.” Here is Lisa analysis of the paper. Eurosceptic group paper on Irish border offers no breakthrough ideas Conservative MPs have openly discussed methods of ousting the prime minister at a private meeting of hardline Brexiters. Jean-Claude Juncker has ruled out the central plank of Theresa May Chequers proposals and scorned the British government plans to build a rival to the EU Galileo satellite project, in a downcast reading of the Brexit negotiations in his annual state of the union speech. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has attacked the benefits system and criticised multibillion dollar firms like Amazon for “leeching off the public” in a speech to the TUC conference. Food production in the UK will be put at risk without government commitments to safeguard farmers after Brexit, and food scares could be the result, the head of the UK biggest farming organisation has warned as ministers announced the biggest shake-up to farming in decades. Downing Street has rejected claims by Russian president Vladimir Putin that there is “nothing criminal” about the prime suspects in the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Airport baggage checks “weren’t probably as good as they might be” and contributed to two Russian nationals being able to bring novichok into the UK, security minister Ben Wallace has suggested. Speaking in a Commons debate on the Salisbury novichok poisonings, he said: When a hostile state is determined to try and use its full resources to penetrate another state, the challenge is much greater. The logistical support of that state in assisting its agents is significant and that means for example that these two individuals travelled on a genuine Russian passport, making it harder to spot, that there was clearly some form of attempt to create a legend to make sure that they circumvented obviously our checks and, only in a speculative way, but no doubt at the other end of that aeroplane journey there was some, I should think the baggage checks weren’t probably as good as they might be. Protesters who targeted the home of Conservative MPS Jacob Rees-Mogg and shouted at this children have been widely condemned by politicians from all parties, and even the archbishop of Canterbury. This is from Labour Yvette Cooper. This is from Labour Stella Creasy. This is from the SNP Stewart McDonald. This is from the Conservative Tom Tugendhat. And this is from Welby. That all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at BST Politics Live readers probably don’t look at the Daily Mail much. But, if they did, they would see that since Paul Dacre was replaced recently as editor by Geordie Greig , there has been a notable shift in its coverage of Brexit . Politico Europe Jack Blanchard summed it up well in his morning briefing. Just check out these headlines on the main politics pages of the new, post-Dacre Daily Mail … Headline “Brexiteer disarray as they shelve Chequers Plan B” … Headline “How No Deal could put your holiday to Europe at risk” …. Headline “We may have to stop building cars here, warns Jaguar boss” … Headline (tiny, buried at the bottom of the spread): “Post-Brexit boost for farmers.” How David Cameron would have killed for this sort of coverage back in And this is from the Economist political editor, Adrian Wooldridge. Voters would narrowly back staying in EU in second referendum, poll suggests We have some new Guardian/ICM polling out today. Mostly it is about Brexit. There is probably just about enough material here to merit a People Vote press release, but in truth the main takeaway is that Brexit opinion does not seem to have shifted much in recent weeks even though the talks deadline is looming and speculation about the UK leaving without a deal has intensified. Second referendum We asked people, as we have done before, how they would vote if there was another EU referendum tomorrow. Voters would narrowly back staying in the EU if another remain/leave referendum were held tomorrow, the poll suggests. On the basis of these results, remain would win by to Support for remain has gone up since we last asked this question in April, but only slightly. Five months ago it was for remain and for leave, with the rest don’t knows or won’t says. Now it is for remain and for leave. Here is ICM Alex Turk on these findings. We asked this question in both January and April this year – both times finding the slimmest of leads for remain over leave. Yet at the third time of asking, we have seen a slightly bigger shift, with remain creeping up one percentage point to and leave slipping down two percentage points to from April. Let not get over-excited about these figures – these are still small shifts in numbers, and the result is still considered well within the margin of error. Nevertheless, this is the largest lead for remain we’ve seen across the three times we’ve asked the question this year. And, when excluding those who prefer not to say, don’t know and wouldn’t vote, the results of this question do catch the eye. If an exact repeat of the referendum were to be held tomorrow, this poll predicts an exact reversal of result – with the country split to but this time in favour of remain. Impact of Brexit We also asked what impact people think Brexit will have on the British economy, their personal finances and life in Britain generally, using a question we have asked repeatedly over the last year and a half. Voters overall continue to think that Brexit will have a negative impact on Britain, the poll suggests, although they are more pessimistic about its impact on the economy (positive impact negative hence net) and on their personal finances (positive negative hence net) than they are about its impact on life in Britain generally positive, negative, hence net.) Here are charts with the figures. The bars measure the net result for each month, and for the figures you need to read the scale across the top. (Note: in each case the difference from May is only one percentage point, but it does not look like that because the scale is different in each chart.) Polling on impact of Brexit on the British economy Here is Turk on these results. Brexiteers may take solace from the fact that there are no huge negative shifts at the overall level. But scratch the surface, and there looks like there might be something interesting happening among those who voted leave in Leavers are still more positive than negative about the aspects of Brexit we ask about, but the gap between those who are positive and negative about the impact of Brexit on the way of lifer in Britain today in general has narrowed by percentage points. Even more strikingly, the equivalent gap has narrowed by percentage points when it comes to the impact on the economy. So while the country remains strongly polarised along the same lines as the referendum, there are small signs that leavers’ initial optimism maybe, just maybe, might be fading at the margins. Voting intention And, finally, here are the voting intention figures. The Conservatives have opened up a three-point lead over Labour, the poll suggests. Since our last poll two weeks ago , the Conservatives are up two points, and Labour down one. The poll tables will go up later on the ICM website. When they do, I will post an update here with the link. UPDATE: Here are the tables (pdf). ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of adults aged between and September Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. Updated at BST And this is from Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. Mark Drakeford, the frontrunner in the contest to replace Carwyn Jones as Welsh Labour leader when he steps down later this year, has said that he would back a second referendum on Brexit if the Commons were to vote down the Brexit deal and a general election (his preference) were not called. This is the official TUC position, and effectively the unofficial Labour leadership position, but it differs from the stance taken by Jones, w ho has opposed a second referendum. ERG Irish border plan backed by DUP, but opposed by Sinn Fein, the CBI and No Here is a round-up of reaction to the ERG Brexit plan for the Irish border. In favour From the DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds The paper published by the European Research Group today is a positive and timely development. The paper makes clear that, in the event of a free trade deal being negotiated with the EU, there are sensible practical measures which can ensure there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. It therefore accurately reflects the fact that the border issue is no impediment to the negotiation by the UK of a comprehensive trade deal with the EU. This a position we have consistently articulated. Unconvinced From a Downing Street spokesman We have been working on the issue of the Northern Irish border for two years and we have looked at a significant number of potential solutions. We believe the plan put forward by Chequers is the only credible and negotiable solution. Against From Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the CBI Local firms will welcome recognition of the importance of the Irish Border issue and the attempts to provide solutions. But this is a disappointing effort – the proposals are too superficial to be of use in practice. If this is the ERGs road to Brexit, the final destination is disastrous for jobs and prosperity. There is no solution to agreeing a backstop, without which the negotiations will not move forward and the much-needed transition will become a cliff edge. The paper is also based on the wrong premise - that a Canada-style deal is desirable. UK businesses have been abundantly clear that such a relationship is an ocean away from what is needed to protect prosperity. From Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard , in a statement put out by Sinn Fein These proposals show again that the Tories do not care about Ireland or the effects that any Brexit deal will have on the Irish people. They are not designed to offer a solution but result from the civil war raging internally within the British Conservative party. These proposals are a rehash of the unacceptable and already rejected and failed notion that a technological border can be put imposed post Brexit. They are pure fantasy with no attempt to set out how they can actually be achieved. From the Labour MP David Lammy , in a statement put out by the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign No-one asked for the ERG report, which offers no serious plan for Brexit. As this group of hardliners has no mandate, no parliamentary and no public majority, it should be met with a collective shrug of the shoulders. From the People Vote campaign, which is calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal The half-baked proposals made today by the European Research Group show that two years on from the referendum, Brexit hardliners are still in denial about the real threat Brexit poses to Northern Ireland It is simply not good enough, as Owen Paterson stated today, to “use imagination” to solve the problems faced by businesses and communities living on each side of the border. The ERG hardliners do not care about Northern Ireland. They have suggested border checks for people and goods, threatened the integrity of the UK, attacked the Good Friday agreement, and downplayed the border issue altogether. Today proposals – aside from the fact that they would be rejected by the EU on day one – are not a credible alternative to the current peace and stability in Northern Ireland that is underpinned by membership of the EU. The proposals are the latest failure of the ERG to articulate their ideological fantasy for a hard Brexit. They should stick to shouting from the side lines, or face up to reality, and allow the country to judge their actions, through a People Vote on the final Brexit deal. I’ll be wrapping up the blog around But we plan to keep comments open until about Archbishop of Canterbury says rollout of universal credit should be halted Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury (and thus head of the Church of England), was speaking to the TUC this morning and what he said about universal credit echoed what Jeremy Corbyn told MPs at PMQs. Welby said; It was supposed to make it simpler and more efficient. It has not done that. It has left too many people worse off, putting them at risk of hunger, debt, rent arrears and food banks. When universal credit comes into a local area the number of people going to food banks goes up. What is clear is if they cannot get it right they need to stop rolling it out. Here is our story about Welby speech. Justin Welby accuses big firms of 'leeching off the public' And here is the full text of his speech. Dan Sabbagh Number has responded to Vladimir Putin declaration that the Salisbury poisoning suspects were “civilians” who had nothing do with the country military. Speaking to journalists after PMQs, the prime minister spokesman repeated the accusation that the two men were GRU agents and accused Russia of continuing to respond with “obfuscation and lies” when asked by the UK to account for what happened in the Wiltshire city in March. The spokesman said: The prime minister set out the position very clearly last week. The police and CPS have identified these men as the prime suspects of the attack in Salisbury. These men are officers of the Russian military intelligence, the GRU who used a devastating toxic, illegal chemical weapon on the streets of our country. The government has exposed the role of the GRU, its operatives and its methods. This position is supported by our international allies. We have repeatedly asked Russia to account for what happened in Salisbury in March. They have replied with obfuscation and lies. I have seen nothing to suggest that has changed. If you want to read the ERG report on Brexit and the Irish border, the full text is available here. PMQs - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat A little later than usual, here is a round-up of what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs . Corbyn seems to have made a better impression than May, but that view is not universal. There is, though, a general consensus that they were good exchanges. From the Daily Mirror Jason Beattie From the New Statesman Anoosh Chakelian From ITV Paul Brand From the Sun Harry Cole From the Guardian Dan Sabbagh From the Birmingham Post Jonathan Walker From the Independent Rob Merrick From the Daily Mirror Kevin Maguire From the Mail on Sunday Dan Hodges I follow PMQs from the TV feed, but it is worth pointing out that colleagues who watched the exchanges from the press gallery found the shouting even worse than usual. From the Yorkshire Post Arj Singh From Business Insider Adam Bienkov May suggests EU will only get part of promised from UK if no Brexit deal In answer to a question from a Conservative MP, Theresa May effectively told MPs that, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the EU won’t get the “divorce payment” agreed in the joint report published by both sides in December. Some Tory Brexiters say that, if there is no agreement, the UK should leave without paying a penny. May is not supporting this line, and she did not say that today. Like Philip Hammond, who addressed this point in evidence to peers yesterday, she accepts that the UK has some legal obligations to the EU and that it would have to pay up regardless of whether or not there is a deal. But quite what those legal obligations would be remains unclear. Today, in response to the question from Chris Philp , May implied that the was a generous offer - she suggested the UK was paying more than it had to, in the interests of good will - and she implied that, without a deal, the UK would certainly not be getting the full amount. She told Philp: We are very clear that we need to have a link between the future relationship and the withdrawal agreement. But we are a country that honours our obligations. We believe in the rule of law. And therefore we believe in abiding by our legal obligations. However, [Philp] is right, that the specific offer was made in our desire to reach a deal with the European Union . And on the basis, as the EU themselves have said, that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, without a deal the position changes. Interestingly, when Michel Barnier , the EU chief Brexit negotiator, met the Commons Brexit committee in Brussels last, he refused to accept that the amount of money that would be handed over by the UK under terms of the December deal was up to That was a UK government figure, he said. According to the transcript subsequently released, he told the MPs: I never used a figure. You mentioned a figure. I never used a figure when we discussed the financial settlement. I never used a figure. We worked well with the British Government on the basis of legal commitments entered into on both sides, legal commitments by your country for the period of its participation in the customs union and the single market against the backdrop of the financial perspectives, so I would not endorse the figure you said. I did not mention that figure. His comments are consistent with claims made at the end of last year that the UK and the EU had agreed to play down the full, eventual value of the “divorce bill” under the complex financial settlement agreement in order to minimise Brexiter protests in the UK. Barnier also insisted that this payment was to cover obligations from the past, not to secure a good trade deal, and he implied that if the UK wanted to guarantee access to the single market, it would have to stump up more. He said: That figure is settlement for the past. You want to leave the European Union. That is your decision, so we settle the accounts. As in any separation or divorce, we settle the accounts. That is what it is. The future is a different matter. If your country—and this might happen—were to request participation in the single market, as per Norway, while remaining outside the European Union, we would discuss your financial participation to European solidarity, but that is for the future. The figure you mentioned relates to settling the balance for the past. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, used his questions at PMQs to ask about the economy. Here is an account of what was said from the Politics Home live blog. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford launches into a tirade about the shuddering recovery from the economic crash while bankers saw little or no retribution. The PM defends the economic picture and protected more people from income tax while boosting jobs. Blackford insists people are poorer as it has been the worst decade for wage growth in years and years. He says the PM is “incapable of leadership” and urges her to end the austerity programme. He didn’t really ask a question there - but the PM defends her Brexit plan (which he also complained about) and noted that the Scottish NFU suggested parties should get behind the Chequers plan. Johnny Mercer , a Conservative, asks if May will intervene to stop soldiers who served in Northern Ireland for being prosecuted for what happened in the past. May says she is aware of how strongly people feel about this. She says the current system is not working. The government wants to ensure all deaths in the past in Northern Ireland are investigated in a way that is fair, proportionate and balanced. But that is not the case at the moment. There is disproportionate attention being paid to deaths caused by the armed forces. of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Theresa May Jeremy Corbyn PMQs Michael Gove Conservatives",3584,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-tory-leadership-brexit-gove-issues-call-for-unity-at-brexiter-anger-against-may-intensifies-politics-live
89,"The Democratic Unionist party MP Ian Paisley is facing the first parliamentary recall petition since legislation was introduced to allow voters to oust misbehaving politicians. Paisley was suspended from the House of Commons for days after acting as a “paid advocate” for Sri Lanka and lobbying on its behalf, while failing to register that the country government had paid for his family to go on holiday twice. This triggered the recall procedure, and should of the electorate, or people, sign a petition over the next six weeks, then a byelection will be held in North Antrim. Paisley said he had already apologised for his “unintentional failure” to register the hospitality, which he estimated was worth He succeeded his father as MP for the constituency in and has said he would stand in a byelection if one is called. Given that his majority is more than some might consider it unlikely that he would lose any subsequent byelection. A report by the Commons standards committee found Paisley actions “were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute”, after it emerged that he had breached the rules on paid advocacy . After he received the holidays from Sri Lanka government, he wrote to David Cameron on March to lobby against supporting a UN resolution on human rights abuses there. He also breached rules by failing to declare the personal benefit in his letter to the prime minister, and on the register of interests. Under the Recall of MPs Act , which came into effect in MPs who are convicted of a criminal offence and jailed, barred from the Commons for sitting days or convicted of providing false information on allowance claims can lose their seat if there is a successful petition to recall them. Last week, the Sinn Féin Northern Ireland assembly member Philip McGuigan said he had written to the electoral office to demand it puts in place the maximum number of voting centres and introduces more flexible voting times. “The decision by the electoral office to locate petitions in only three locations in a large rural constituency like North Antrim is extremely disappointing and greatly reduces people ability to reject Ian Paisley disgraceful behaviour,” he said. “Some people will have to travel up to miles to vote in one of these three centres, and those who work outside of the constituency won’t have time to vote outside of working hours.” McGuigan said the number of voting centres for the Paisley petition was significantly lower than for the general election, when there were ballot across locations. He said some people would feel uncomfortable signing the petition at the Ballymoney centre in County Antrim because of the area strong unionist influence.",452,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/08/dups-ian-paisley-faces-recall-from-parliament
90,"The electoral office in Northern Ireland has been accused of limiting the number of venues where North Antrim voters can sign a petition to remove Ian Paisley as an MP. Legislation allows for up to centres to be set up in the constituency where a historic recall petition – which could oust the suspended Democratic Unionist party MP from his seat and force a byelection - can be signed over a six-week period. However, the electoral office has decided to set up only three in North Antrim, one of which will be located in a Unionist stronghold. The recall petition is the first of its kind and comes after Paisley was suspended last week. The parliamentary standards committee found him guilty of “serious misconduct” for failing to declare of family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government in He then breached the rules on paid advocacy by writing to David Cameron in to lobby against a UN resolution on human rights abuses in Sri Lanka .

The Guardian view on Ian Paisley suspension: between a rock and a hard place | Editorial The Ulster Unionist party leader, Robin Swann, agreed with McGuigan that the number of venues was “totally inadequate” for the size of the constituency. “I suspect that this very limited provision, both in terms of locations and timings, will lead to a larger than usual request for postal votes – and whether rightly or wrongly – this may well lead to accusations of voter identity abuse,” he said. However, the chief electoral officer, Virginia McVea, rejected the criticism. “I could have opened one venue or I could have opened she told the BBC Good Morning Ulster. “This runs for a lengthy period – six weeks – and during that period I determined that it would be reasonable to expect people to be able to reach these three venues. In addition there is a change in the law in relation to the postal application. “Anyone who chooses not to attend in person will be able to apply for the postal option and if their details are verified, can receive it within six weeks.” The petition will run from August to September and will be available for signing on weekdays from to in centres in Ballymoney, Ballymena and Ballycastle.",566,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/04/petition-to-remove-mp-ian-paisley-in-north-antrim-criticised
91,"The Electoral Commission will not investigate the Democratic Unionist party over claims it coordinated its Brexit referendum campaign spending with Vote Leave in order to break legal spending limits. The Northern Irish party, which props up Theresa May government in the Commons, had faced a series of allegations about its spending during the EU referendum, after it spent hundreds of thousands of pounds campaigning to leave the bloc. The DUP referendum spending was aided by a donation from unknown individuals, channelled through an organisation run by a former Scottish Conservative parliamentary candidate. The original source of the donation remains unclear, as until recently the law did not require political parties in Northern Ireland to declare their financial backers. The DUP then spent most of its money campaigning outside Northern Ireland, including buying a advert in the Metro newspaper, which is only distributed in Great Britain. The party also paid for targeted Facebook advertising through AggregateIQ, at that time an obscure Canadian social media business, which was at the centre of the illegal campaign coordination between Vote Leave and the campaign group BeLeave , run by the young campaigner Darren Grimes. The Electoral Commission considered the DUP allegations after they were made in a BBC investigation , which alleged the party pro-Brexit activity was conducted as part of a common campaign with Vote Leave – enabling the pro-Brexit lobbying group to break spending limits. The regulator has now concluded it “does not have grounds to open an investigation” because it does not have sufficient evidence. A spokesperson confirmed there were no other ongoing investigations into DUP activities during the referendum. The commission has also rejected claims from the Tory MP Priti Patel that the official remain campaign should be investigated for allegedly coordinating spending between various pro-EU groups during the referendum. “After a thorough assessment, our conclusion is that we can find nothing beyond conjecture to support the argument that there must be undeclared joint spending between these various [remain] campaigners,” said Louise Edwards, head of regulation at the organisation. “There is nothing we can point to that reasonably indicates some kind of common campaign activity.” Edwards said there had to be clear evidence of one pro-EU group directing another on how to spend money in order to prompt an investigation. She said it was legal for campaigners to “use the same suppliers and the same volunteers”, while donors are legally allowed to give to more than one campaign group working for the same cause. However, the Electoral Commission concluded that it would investigate a campaign group called Wake Up And Vote after finding there was “reasonable suspicion” that it may have coordinated its spending with an ad agency to produce a series of videos featuring actors Lily Cole, Keira Knightley and Dominic Cooper urging people to vote. In May the Electoral Commission fined Leave.EU , the pro-Brexit campaign group founded by Arron Banks, after finding that it had breached multiple counts of electoral law. Pro-Brexit campaigners have increasingly turned their anger on the commission itself following its ruling against the activities of Leave.EU and Vote Leave. One activist who was fined as part of the investigation into Brexit spending, on Thursday released a film of himself paying the penalty in cash, which he dumped on the floor in the foyer of the Electoral Commission central London office. The commission also told Patel, a former cabinet minister, that they were exasperated by the attacks on the organisation neutrality with regards to Brexit: “It would be wrong for us to take decisions on the basis that we must balance action in respect of ‘leave’ campaigners with action in respect of ‘remain’ campaigners. That would undermine our neutrality, rather than ensure it.”",619,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/02/electoral-commission-drops-investigation-into-dup-over-brexit-spending
92,"Theresa May has taken back control of crucial negotiations with Brussels from her new Brexit secretary just hours after the government published its latest white paper on withdrawing from the European Union. Giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, Dominic Raab , the new Brexit secretary, said it was a “caricature” to suggest that this meant his department had been sidelined. Raab suggested the government was willing to compromise on the Chequers plans set out in a recent white paper. (That is not the same as the white paper published today.) Addressing the committee, he said: This is a far advanced, well thought-out, principled and pragmatic document and we expect to negotiate on the basis of it. Obviously, we will consider what Monsieur [Michel] Barnier and the come up with but this is an ambitious approach which takes into account some of the concerns the EU has expressed to us. This is from Politico Europe Tom McTague. Raab confirmed that the UK wanted to ensure that the promise to pay to the EU in the withdrawal agreement would be conditional on the EU going ahead with the trade deal expected to be agreed in outline form at the same time. He said that he agreed with Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, about wanting to “de-dramatise” the Irish border issue. (See Raab refused to rule out Northern Ireland having a different regulatory regime from the rest of the UK. This is from Bloomberg Ian Wishart. Raab hinted that EU nationals could get a preferential immigration status after Brexit. (See He said the government would ensure that, in the event of a no deal Brexit, there were adequate food supplies. Asked about reports the government was planning to stockpile food, Raab said: We will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there adequate food supplies. It would be wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling. Olly Robbins, the prime minister chief Brexit adviser, told the same committee that Theresa May had not cleared her Chequers plan with other EU leaders in advance. Asked about this, he said: Over months now, ministers, the prime minister and the official team supporting them have been sounding European partners out on all the issues the white paper takes on. But even if we were to try to say ‘Does this package work for you?’ I doubt we would get a straight answer. So what we have been trying to do is work out what is in the best interests of the UK and advise ministers on putting that position forward. Raab was accused of alarming EU nationals when he told MPs in a statement to the Commons that, in the event of a no deal Brexit, there would be “no wholesale removal of rights” from EU nationals living in the UK. The Green MP Caroline Lucas said Raab had “sent alarm bells clanging in the homes of around three million EU citizens living in this country”. Subsequently, in evidence to the committee, Raab said that he intended to say there would be no wholesale removal of EU nationals and that their rights would be respected.

Updated at BST DUP suspends Ian Paisley The DUP MP Ian Paisley has been suspended by the Democratic Unionist party, the Press Association reports. The North Antrim MP will also be excluded from the House of Commons for sitting days from September following a major breach of parliamentary rules. Electoral authorities in Northern Ireland are to begin drawing up measures which could see him face a by-election if enough constituents demand it. He has vowed to fight for his seat if he faces the electorate over his failure to declare two luxury family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. As the Press Association reports, in March the MP lobbied against a proposed United Nations resolution to investigate alleged human rights abuses during a civil war on the Indian Ocean island without citing his financial benefits. If of his constituents sign a petition, an election will be called. A DUP statement said it took the matter very seriously. It said: The party officers have decided to suspend Mr Ian Paisley MP from membership of the party pending further investigation into his conduct. Hilary Benn wraps up the Brexit committee hearing, saying he expects the committee to take evidence again from Dominic Raab and Olly Robbins after the October EU summit. This is from Politico Europe Annabelle Dickson. Here is George Osborne , the former chancellor, on the news that Theresa May has taken charge of the Brexit negotiations. Q: The final paper was very different from the one being drafted by DExEU. Robbins says there was not “some sudden twist in the road”, when one white paper was replaced with another. Jacob Rees-Mogg , the Conservative Brexiter, goes next. Q: [To Robbins] Congratulations. You must be very pleased with the PM statement. Where does your authority come from? Robbins says he works for the goverment. Q: Do you accept that advisers advise, and ministers decide. Yes, says Robbins. Q: Did David Davis receive all the advice you gave? Robbins says in the past there were two teams of civil servants, working closely together, one advising the PM and one advising Davis. They worked more closely than other teams in Westminster. But now there will just be one stream of advice, he says. Q: When did you start working on the Chequers plan? Robbins says the civil service has been working for some time on how to deliver the plan set out in the Mansion House speech. So, from the day it was delivered, civil servants have been thinking hard about how to implement it. Q: Papers were presented to the cabinet just before Chequers. When did you start to write those? Robbins says he does not want to discuss that. Q: I’m not asking what was in them. I’m asking about the timeline. It is important for knowing cabinet government is working. Robbins says these papers have their origins in other papers. He says he had been working on them for some time. Q: When did you start? Robbins says the PM asked for first drafts about a fortnight before. Rees-Mogg concludes by saying that he does not blame Robbins for any of this. Robbins works for the PM, he says - implying he finds May at fault. UPDATE: This is from MLex Matthew Holehouse. Updated at BST Q: Places like Greece have dreadful unemployment. The EU has not helped. I’m worried we are accepting their rules. Raab says he agrees with Mackinlay about the flaws with the EU. Craig Mackinlay, a Conservative Brexiter, goes next. Q: There was a plan that the public were happy with. But it was ripped up. When? Robbins says he does not accept that characterisation. He says he was proud to work with David Davis and happy to work with him. The origins of the Chequers plan are well established. Q: My mother had a good saying: “To yourself be true.” I have asked a lot of people about the Chequers deal, and they don’t like it. This “common rulebook” is not a common rulebook. It is their rulebook. If am making a pen for sale in the UK, why should I have to comply with an EU standard. It could make it harder to sell my pen in the US, where standards are slightly different. Raab says, if the UK had full regulatory autonomy, that would be “an additional string to our bow” in trade talks. But he says the common rulebook approach will avoid delays at the border, and addresses the Irish border issue. Asked about his involvement in Vote Leave, Raab says he was proud to be involved in it. But he says he was not involved in how it allocated money. And he did not have dealings with BeLeave. He suggests that Kinnock is raising this because he wants to reverse the referendum result. Kinnock says this is bigger than the referendum. He says this is about the integrity of our democracy. Q: It is hard to believe the campaign committee that you were on did not know about the BeLeave donation, the biggest you made. Raab says Kinnock misunderstands the role of that committee. And he says, if Kinnock is concerned about the “soul of our democracy”, he should not be backing a second referendum. Kinnock says he agrees. He says he has never advocated a second referendum. Labour Stephen Kinnock goes next. Q: You are on the record as saying you do no support the Human Rights Act, that it is too difficult to hire and fire in this country, and that you do not support the working time directive. And you once complained about “obnoxious” feminist bigotry. Raab says Kinnock is quoting from a book he wrote in the past. He says he point he was making about human rights was to query whether they deserved a higher status than other rights. On the working time directive, he says the government has been clear it will maintain workers’ rights. He fully accepts that. And he says, if you are serious about rights, why should you need to delegate that responsibility to an outside body. And, on feminism, he say he fully supports equal rights. But he thinks you should call out double standards where you see them. of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Dominic Raab Pay Public sector pay Jeremy Corbyn Public services policy",1637,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jul/24/brexit-dominic-raab-white-paper-growth-minimal-and-going-backwards-for-millions-of-poorer-families-says-thinktank-politics-live

But he went on: In relation to the repayment mechanism [a system whereby importers would pay the higher of the UK or EU tariff, and then claim a refund if their goods ended up in the lower tariff territory], that would take a bit longer because it needs to be clear about what free trade agreements the UK has signed, how much difference does that make to tariffs, and then business needs to make an economic decision about whether the tariff differential is worth reclaiming or not ... We would need to write this piece of very bespoke technology to allow them to get the tariff refund. So we are being upfront with ministers. We do not think the tariff refund would be there for January That would take some time after that .... It requires some further work from us to work out exactly what that piece of technology is and how long exactly would it take to acquire it because it is a very bespoke arrangement. We can’t find anywhere else in the world that does that. Thompson also told peers the FCA plan would cost business around a year.

Updated at BST Up to five Tory MPs were told to break pairs on Tuesday, Sun claims According to a story by Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun, as many as five Conservative MPs who were paired on Tuesday night were asked by the chief whip, Julian Smith, to break the pair and vote regardless. The paper quotes an unnamed MP who was involved as saying: Julian told me I was needed and told me to come in and vote. Of course he knew I was paired. I didn’t vote and honoured my pair, and he demanded to know why not afterwards. It then appears Julian told the prime minister it was all an innocent mistake ... What happened was unacceptable. We cannot behave like this. In the event only one Conservative, the party chairman Brandon Lewis, did break a pair. Theresa May , Smith, Lewis and Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, have all claimed this was an innocent mistake. Giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee this morning, the acting cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill , said the UK would be ready for a no deal Brexit . He told MPs: We will be ready but we shouldn’t assume it will be smooth, if it a disruptive outcome ... We do have confidence in our ‘no deal’ planning, we know that it will be disruptive for them and for us if there is no deal and that we haven’t been able to find some other arrangement. But we will be ready for that and we have a whole range of mechanisms, some of them designed over many years for different circumstances that we can apply should that be the case against a range of no deal scenarios. I wouldn’t want any of our partners to think that we won’t be ready for it. MoD to spend reimbursing service personnel paying higher taxes in Scotland Severin Carrell The Ministry of Defence is to spend about reimbursing military personnel who are paying higher income taxes in Scotland, with some highly-paid officers getting back this year. Gavin Williamson , the Defence secretary, said military personnel who have to pay higher Scottish income taxes would get a lump payment at the end of this tax year worth between and per head. The move is designed to fuel the battle between the Conservatives and Edinburgh Scottish National party government over its decision to use Scotland new powers to set its own income tax rates. Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, announced last December that higher tax rates would rise by this year, with a new intermediate tax rate for middle earners, after intense pressure from Labour, the Lib Dems and Scottish Greens to use his new tax powers to boost spending. Williamson claimed that unfairly penalised Scottish military personnel, many of whom are based overseas but are taxed at the Scottish rate, and would make Scotland a less attractive posting for army, navy and air force staff. It could also put off some Scots from joining the armed forces because they would be paid less than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK. With youth unemployment rates at a low level currently, Scotland infantry regiments have been struggling to recruit new personnel. “It is completely wrong for the brave men and women of our armed forces to be punished for serving in Scotland by unfair raids on their pay packets by the Scottish government,” he said. Mackay insisted those higher taxes helped pay for other tangible benefits for Scottish residents, including free school meals, free prescriptions and eye tests and free tuition at Scottish universities. Scottish council tax and water rates are also often much lower than in England, while council spending is higher than in England. The EU has now published its document urging member states to step up preparations for a no deal Brexit . Here is the news release about it. And here is the main document (pdf). Tory MP Andrew Bridgen casts doubt on claims broken pair incident was honest mistake This is what Andrew Bridgen , the Conservative MP, told the Daily Politics a few minutes ago when asked what he thought actually happened in the broken pair incident. (See He said: I think the fact that Brandon Lewis abstained on six votes and then just mysteriously voted on the vital two - I think it tells you all you need to know. Bridgen also made it clear that he thought the opposition parties should not get too indignant. Referring probably to this report on the Guido Fawkes website, he said that both Labour and the Lib Dems have broken pairs since the general election. Updated at BST On the Daily Politics the Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen was asked a moment ago about the pair breaking scandal and what he thought actually happened (ie, whether he believed it was an honest mistake). Bridgen said the fact that Brandon Lewis did not vote in most of the divisions on Tuesday night, but did vote in the two crucial ones, “tells you all you need to know”. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen casts doubt on claims broken pair incident was an honest mistake. Updated at BST Alistair Carmichael on how he did not find Julian explanation satisfactory This is what Alistair Carmichael , the Lib Dem chief whip, told MPs a few minutes ago about the pair breaking scandal. (See In the course of that urgent question [yesterday, on the broken pair incident] I indicated that I had received an apology from the government chief whip [Julian Smith, which of course I accepted, not that I did not quite understand how things had come to pass in this way. I indicated also that I would pursue that with the government chief whip. I have to tell the House that, subsequent to the urgent question, I did meet with the government chief whip. He did offer me a fuller explanation which I have considered very carefully overnight. Regrettably I have to say I still do not understand how this highly regrettable state of affairs came to pass. Carmichael said Smith should come to the Commons to make a statement himself to clear things up. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, replied: I’m grateful to [Carmichael] for his measured words and I’m glad that he did indeed meet with the chief whip. I have, as I made clear yesterday, been absolutely assured that it was an administrative error. I sought to explain to the House yesterday that in pairing it is very often the absence of an hour or two and therefore the administrative complexity around managing temporary pairings during the course of a day are quite significant. I also made clear to the House that [Brandon Lewis], by virtue of the conversations I had with him - it was absolutely clear to me that he was totally unaware that he was paired with [Jo Swinson]. I myself texted [Swinson] and I have made very clear to her that I will continue to ensure that her maternity pair is in place. I apologise again for that error that took place, and also reassure the House that it did not change the outcome of that division. This explanation is odd because Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem MP, needs a pair because she has just had a baby and is on maternity leave. It is not as if she was planning to vote in some divisions, but not others. And Lewis did not not take part in most of the divisions on Tuesday night (honouring the pairing arrangement). But he did take part in the two closest ones (one of which the government won, and one of which it lost.) Robert Peston, ITV political editor, says he has also been told by a source that Julian Smith, the Conservative chief whip, ordered an MP to break a pair on Tuesday night. The government, of course, is claiming that the pair was broken as a result of an honest mistake. of Newest Oldest Politics Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Conservatives Dominic Raab Theresa May Vince Cable Democratic Unionist party (DUP)",3029,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jul/19/may-will-have-to-revise-chequers-plan-in-face-of-tory-opposition-says-former-brexit-minister-politics-live

Theresa May was told that one critical MP had withdrawn his support for a leadership contest. But she was warned many more had not. Boris Johnson has used a stinging resignation speech in the House of Commons to urge the prime minister to change tack on Brexit, branding the future sketched out at Chequers a “miserable, permanent limbo” Theresa May has told MPs that dozens of documents spelling out the actions needed to prepare for a no deal Brexit will be published this summer. Giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee, she said: Over August and September we are going to be releasing a number of technical notifications to set out what UK citizens and businesses need to do in a no deal scenario, so making much more public awareness of the preparations. We imagine there are going to be around of those technical notices that will be issued. May admitted that some aspects of her facilitated customs arrangement plan might not be ready by the end of when the transition period is due to end. (See The EU gave the British negotiating team a torrid time at the first presentation of the UK white paper on the future relationship during this week talks, the Guardian has learned . Updated at BST My colleague, Heather Stewart , has been looking at Boris Johnson Commons speech. Here, she explains what said and what he meant: Annotated speech: what Boris Johnson said and what he meant The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar , has said his government will have to “change gear” in how it deals with Brexit . The nation cabinet has been discussing ways to step up preparations for a hard Brexit on Wednesday. Its government is also planning to hire custom officers and veterinary inspectors at its ports and airports. Varadkar said that, with Brexit eight months away, growing uncertainty loomed over whether it would be possible to get a withdrawal agreement through Westminster. We need to change the gear and up our preparations in dealing with Brexit. Updated at BST Jessica Elgot In a dramatic intervention, the Conservative MP, Simon Clarke , stood up and declared he was withdrawing his letter of no confidence in the prime minister and said others should give her their backing. Afterwards, Clarke told reporters he had put in his letter last Tuesday following the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis as foreign and Brexit secretaries, respectively. But Clarke said he had since had second thoughts. We have got a mission in government and it is serious. God knows, the threat of a Corbyn government is real. May had stressed the risks of an election and a Labour administration, he said, adding: We’ve looked into the abyss in the last few days. We’ve really been through the mill. We should just not do this. One MP said the scene was “electric” when Clarke withdrew his letter, saying they had “never seen anything like that in all my years at the Clarke said the prime minister was impassive as he did so. That the prime minister, she doesn’t buckle under pressure and she doesn’t revel in the good times. There was no big smile. Another MP said May had “done enough”. I think we’ve all witnessed her under attack by both sides, both Andrea Jenkyns at PMQs and by Anna Soubry yesterday, and the vast majority of us are in the middle and don’t want to see chaos. Steve Baker , who resigned as a Brexit minister last week over the prime minister Chequers deal, has a further warning for Theresa May . He suggested the number of his Tory colleagues willing to vote down any deal that is “too soft” is substantially more than The number required to trigger a leadership challenge is A number of has been bandied around in this House in the last few days – I’m sorry to say, it gives me no pleasure to say it, but the thing I have to say is ‘and the rest’. The people who have said the number are not out by a fraction when they come to consider the number of members who don’t like this deal on these benches and are willing to vote in line with that dislike, they are out by a factor. People must face up to the difficult truth that a Brexit which requires a high degree of permanent alignment to the European Union will not go through this House of Commons . It will fail. Others apparently believe the magic number will be reached soon: Yesterday, senior Conservatives was trying to portray the choice facing rebellious Tory MPs as being between backing Theresa May and backing Jeremy Corbyn, whom party whips were claiming would be the main beneficiary of a Commons defeat for the government over Brexit. The Brexit-supporting MP, Iain Duncan Smith , is echoing that language as he leaves the meeting: Simon Clarke , the Tory MP who withdrew his letter of no confidence this afternoon, is making clear that May government is not out of the woods yet.

That all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Theresa May spoke to reporters on her way into the Conservative committee meeting. She confirmed that she had not seen Boris Johnson speech. And, as the Sun Tom Newton Dunn reports, she said that watching it later would not be a priority. As my colleague Pippa Crerar reports, she also told journalists they needed a break. In his speech Boris Johnson claimed the pound “soared” after Theresa May Lancaster House speech. But, as the Press Association Ian Jones says, it didn’t. At the liaison committee Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, is now asking about defence. In an unusual (and welcome) move, the committee has provided a visual aid. It has posted this graph (pdf) on its website showing how defence spending has more than halved since the as a proportion of GDP.

Her working majority will be reduced by one until November, as the government tries to pass contentious Brexit legislation . The ban, if accepted, could trigger a recall petition following a recent change to legislation. If of the electorate signs a petition within six weeks, a byelection would take place at which Paisley could stand again. Political opponents in Northern Ireland , including the Ulster Unionist party, the SDLP and Sinn Féin, have called for him to resign or face a public vote. A spokesperson for Sinn Féin said that in the absence of his resignation or being forced to stand down by the DUP “we will support a recall if the percentage of the electorate required to trigger a recall prevails”. Paisley suspension has been recommended by the Commons standards committee in a highly critical report examining two family holidays the MP took to Sri Lanka in It could last sitting days and is due to begin on September, the committee said. Parliament is in recess over the party conference season, meaning the suspension would last well into the autumn. “We have concluded that Mr Paisley actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute,” the report said. In her report, the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, found that Paisley breached the rules on paid advocacy – lobbying in return for reward or consideration – by writing to David Cameron on March to lobby against supporting a UN resolution on human rights abuses in Sri Lanka, after receiving holidays from the South Asian country government. He also breached rules by failing to declare the personal benefit in his letter to the prime minister, and on registration of interests. Paisley would be free to stand again in the subsequent byelection and it is understood he has indicated he would do so.

96,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has sparked a fresh row about the status of the Irish border after Brexit after a video emerged in which he suggests a return to checks “as we had during the Troubles”. The Conservative MP is seen on the footage from the public meeting suggesting the government could “keep an eye on” the border. “Ireland would not be a free for all. It would be perfectly possible to continue with historic arrangements to ensure that there wasn’t a great loophole in the way people can get into the UK, to leave us in as bad a position as we are already in,” Rees-Mogg says. “There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected. It not a border that everyone has to go through every day, but of course for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border, to try and stop gun-running and things like that.” The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, was sharply critical of his comments. “This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland ,” he said. Ireland deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, tweeted: Rees-Mogg has previously been criticised for saying he did not need to visit Northern Ireland to understand the challenges Brexit posed for communities on the border. His comments, earlier this year, were described as arrogant and judgmental by people living there. In an interview with BBC Northern Ireland , he said: “I don’t think my visiting the border is really going give me a fundamental insight into the border beyond what one can get by studying it.” The Sinn Féin politician Mártín Ó Muilleoir, South Belfast MLA, said Rees-Mogg comments on the border after Brexit showed “contempt and complete disregard for the people of Ireland north and south, through the ridiculous suggestion of a ‘technological border’. “Anyone labouring under the misapprehension that the Tories care a jot about the north is living in a fool paradise.” The status of the Irish border remains one of the toughest sticking points in the UK negotiations on a withdrawal agreement with the EU. Theresa May has said no UK prime minister could accept the EU proposal, for Northern Ireland effectively to remain in the customs union and the single market, with the rest of the UK outside – requiring a border in the Irish Sea. The EU for its part regards Britain solution of a “facilitated customs arrangement”as unworkable. The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, acknowledged on Friday that the October deadline once regarded as the end-date for the Brexit negotiations could now slip to November. Moderate Tories need to understand: the extremists are unappeasable | Rafael Behr Tensions among senior Conservatives in cabinet were also exposed at the weekend, as the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, played down the significance of Treasury forecasts suggesting a no-deal Brexit would blow an hole in public finances . “I’m always wary of any forecast, because most of them have been proved to be wrong,” he told the Sunday Times. As May battles to complete a deal, Rees-Mogg is leading a vocal group of Conservative MPs calling on the party to “chuck Chequers”, the negotiating position painstakingly agreed by cabinet at their July awayday. They are keen to play down the significance of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which they believe has driven the logic of the push toward a softer Brexit. Boris Johnson told MPs in his resignation speech, after he rejected the Chequers deal: “We allowed the question of the Northern Irish border, which had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble, to become so politically charged as to dominate the debate.”",610,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/26/have-people-inspected-at-irish-border-after-brexit-says-jacob-rees-mogg
97,"As transformational journeys go, this one, it might be said, takes the biscuit. Gerry Adams , the former president of Sinn Féin and a veteran Irish republican, has revealed he is writing a cookery book. The book, which is being teed up for the Christmas market, will contain recipes with “some of the best-kept secrets” of the peace process, he said. Adams gave details of his latest venture at a talk in Belfast, tweeting what appeared to be the front cover of the book, entitled The Negotiator Cookbook. The revelation cooked up a storm on social media, with suggested recipe titles including “the peas process”, “pizza in our time”, “ Mary Lou Irish stew” and “Cookie Ár Lá” – a reference to the Irish republican phrase Tiocfaidh ár lá, meaning “our day will come”. However, others voiced incredulity at Adams’ decision to publish something so seemingly frivolous when there were still so many questions about deaths during the Troubles. His co-authors Ted Howell and Padraic Wilson are fellow republicans. Howell, once described as the closest thing Sinn Féin has to an éminence grise, is said to be one of Adams’ closest confidants. Adams said the book would contain recipes that kept negotiators going through the peace process talks in and The Guardian view on the Gerry Adams cookbook: recipe for reconciliation? | Editorial He reportedly told an audience in Belfast : “The British never fed us. They never had any food. But as intrepid republicans and being blessed by one or two great cooks, these are the recipes that sustained the Irish negotiating team. “It contains some of the best-kept secrets of the Irish peace process,” he added, disclosing that he was also writing a book of short stories. While it is safe to bet that Adams will never make it to the Great British Bake Off, he revealed he was a fan of British children literature when he was growing up, devouring the books of Enid Blyton and Roy of the Rovers. Adams, who was once one of the most feared figures in Anglo-Irish politics, has undergone something of a folksy makeover in the past five years, tweeting pictures of himself hillwalking and doing daily chores. In his tweets and interviews, he has revealed he likes “trampolining before dawn” with his dog, “peeling spuds” listening to Joan Baez – and toy ducks.",393,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/07/good-fryday-former-sinn-fein-leader-gerry-adams-writing-cookbook
98,"Ireland is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit as Theresa May prepares to visit the Irish border. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the instability in Westminster meant there was no guarantee that a withdrawal agreement, even if agreed in Brussels, would get passed in London. “We can’t make assumptions that the withdrawal agreement will get through Westminster,” he said. “It not evident, or not obvious, that the government of Britain has the majority for any form of Brexit , quite frankly.” Because of this, he said, his government would step up plans for a no-deal scenario. His deputy, Simon Coveney, will brief the Irish cabinet at a meeting in Kerry on Wednesday about contingency planning, including the recruitment of extra customs officer for ports and airports. On Thursday May is due to arrive in Northern Ireland for a two-day visit. She will visit a border area and meet businesspeople to hear their views. On Friday she will give a speech in Belfast about the government Brexit white paper and how it addresses the Irish border issue. She is also due to meet the main Stormont party leaders to try to kickstart a new round of talks on restoring power-sharing in the devolved assembly. Concerns have been raised that an amendment to the customs bill passed in the Commons on Monday night making a border in the Irish Sea unlawful will leave the prime minister unable to deliver a backstop solution for Northern Ireland in the event of no deal. Brexiters seem to forget that ‘no deal’ is not legally an option | Brendan Howlin The amendment, supported by Kate Hoey, the Northern Ireland-born MP for Vauxhall in London, went through on a nod on Monday night and makes it illegal for the government to enter into “any agreements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate territory to Great Britain”. May said on Wednesday: “I’ve been clear we will not accept the imposition of any border down the Irish Sea and we will preserve the integrity of the UK internal market and Northern Ireland place within it.” Coveney told RTÉ Morning Ireland on Wednesday that Brexiter amendments to the UK government customs and trade bills were “unhelpful”. He said the law banning a border in the Irish Sea could be trumped by the Good Friday agreement, which gives voters the right to self-determination and has the status of an international treaty. Coveney said he did not accept that the amendment made the backstop illegal. Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator for Brexit, will advise member states at a European council meeting on Friday to deepen contingency planning. A EU draft review of the UK white paper, seen by RTÉ, says the consequences of no deal “will be very real for citizens, professionals and business operators”. Separately, Sinn Féin has come under concerted attack north and south of the border from rivals who say its seven MPs could have defeated the Brexiter amendments had it abandoned its Westminster abstentionist policy . Charlie Flanagan, the justice minister and a member of Varadkar Fine Gael party, tweeted: “The refusal by Sinn Féin to take up its Westminster seats has plunged the British PM into the clutches of the hard Brexiteers again. Government wins knife-edge vote by wafer thin margin.” Stephen Donnelly, the Brexit spokesman for Fianna Fáil, which is in a supply-and-confidence government with Fine Gael, also criticised Sinn Féin . Sinn Féin has operated an abstentionist policy for years, standing for elections in Northern Ireland but not taking its seats. . The trade bill was passed by just six votes, and amendments to the customs bill were won by three and four votes. “Hardline Brexiteers won last evening Westminster vote because of Sinn Féin abstentionism,” the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, said. It is the first time in years that Sinn Féin abstentionist policy has come under such a concerted attack. The health minister, Simon Harris, also criticised the party for not taking its chance to influence Brexit policy.

99,"An explosive device thrown at the home of former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams was hurled from a moving car, CCTV footage of the incident has revealed. A short clip obtained by the Press Association and RTE on Sunday shows a car passing a driveway. As it passes, sparks can be seen around a parked car in a driveway and then black smoke. The home of prominent republican Bobby Storey in west Belfast was also attacked. No one was hurt in either of the incidents, which took place just after on Friday. The CCTV footage has been shared with detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which is investigating. The PSNI said officers seized “remnants of large industrial, firework-type devices, capable of causing serious damage or injury” at two houses in west Belfast. Significant damage was visible to a vehicle on Adams driveway in the aftermath of the attack. On Saturday, Adams said he did not know who was responsible for the attacks, but thought there may be a connection with the recent disorder in Derry . He challenged those behind the attacks to him and explain themselves. “For those who were involved in the attack, if they have the gumption to sneak up on our homes, I’d like them or their representatives to come and meet me,” he said. “I’d like them to sit down and explain to me what this is about. I’d like those who are involved in exploiting children in Derry to do the same thing, or those who are poisoning the atmosphere in east Belfast and causing havoc to do the same thing.” He said he can be contacted through any Sinn Féin office, adding: “So that my direct appeal to them. Come and sit down and explain to me what this is about. Give us the rationale for this action.” A solidarity rally is being held on Monday evening at the site of the former Andersonstown police station in west Belfast for the families of Adams and Storey. It is also being held for the people of Derry who last week endured six consecutive nights of disorder. Sinn Féin president, Mary Lou McDonald, will be the main speaker at the rally which will also be attended by Adams and Storey. West Belfast Sinn Féin MLA (member of the legislative assembly) Pat Sheehan deplored the attacks as “cowardly and reprehensible”. “Those involved are opposed to the peace process and the process of change,” he said. “Monday night rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on republicans and on the community to stop immediately,” he said. Friday attacks in west Belfast came after six successive nights of dissident-orchestrated violence in the republican Bogside neighbourhood of Derry. Sinn Féin leaders, including McDonald, were scathing in the criticism of the extremists behind the rioting and attacks on police.

0,"f the hundreds of documents the German author and illustrator Nora Krug has wrenched from archives and flea markets for her sprawling, multilayered graphic memoir, two of the most emotionally arresting are about fungi. The first is a page from her uncle Franz-Karl sixth-grade school exercise book, which Krug discovered in a musty drawer in her parents’ living room. Each line is filled with meticulously crafted Sütterlin script , a now largely obsolete form of German handwriting. The margins are populated by childish pine trees and toadstools with grinning faces. “When you go to the forest and you see mushrooms that look beautiful, you think that they are good,” the text reads. “But when you eat them, they are poisonous and can kill a whole family.” Then the gut-wrencher: “The Jew is just like this mushroom.” The short essay, called The Jew, a Poisonous Mushroom, got a C for spelling, C for handwriting and B for content. It is dated January days before Hitler declared that the outcome of another world war would be “the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe”. The second document is a letter Krug great-uncle Edwin wrote to his wife from the eastern front five years later. “I remembered the time when the two of us went into the woods together, and when we collected things from the forest. I’ve seen some wonderful chanterelles , but what good are they, if you don’t get a chance to cook them?” Edwin writes. “Slowly, berries and mushrooms are coming to an end, because nature is beginning to show its cold face. Everything dies, or better, returns to its inner calm. Even humans long for that, but unfortunately it isn’t possible in these eventful times.” The next document is a letter from Edwin company leader, informing his wife that he went missing in combat on the Sõrve peninsula in Estonia on November Each of Edwin letters is illustrated with a portrait of their author, each one sketchier and paler than the last, until Krug great-uncle has been literally rubbed out of history. Of her two German relatives, one sounds as if he had the potential to become culpable in one of the most monstrous crimes in human history. The other ended up as a victim of conflict. Was Edwin a better German than Franz-Karl? Does one uncle suffering offset another hatred? And should their guilt be carried forward to a relative living in Brooklyn today? Krug memoir Heimat: A German Family Album seeks to wade through this moral quagmire, what she calls the “grey zone of war”, full of “people you can neither classify as resistance fighters or as victims, nor as war criminals”. It is a surprising mission for a writer born in The task of Vergangenheitsbewältigung , of coming to terms with the National Socialist era, is in Germany mainly associated with the literature and films of Krug parents’ generation. “If I had stayed in Germany, I would have never thought of writing this book,” she says over a coffee in a beer garden in central Berlin. “There that Hannah Arendt line: ‘If all are guilty, no one is.’ As a German in Germany you have already learned so much about the second world war, thought so much about it and talked so much about it, that I would have thought: what left to be said?” Krug perspective changed when she left her hometown of Karlsruhe behind aged and headed abroad – first to Liverpool, where she studied at Paul McCartney Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, and then to New York, where she now teaches illustration at the Parsons School of Design and lives in Brooklyn with her husband and daughter. Being a German living abroad, she says, makes it harder to extricate yourself from your home country history: “As soon as you answer someone who asks you where you are from, the association with the Nazi period is there. You are constantly being confronted with it.” She adds: “I have been to parties in New York where complete strangers told me that Germany was a country they could never visit. I was ashamed, but sometimes it would reach a point where I would feel angry – always inwardly, of course, not outwardly – about the lack of admission that Germany has changed.” After years of living in the US and now married into a Jewish family, she writes: “I feel more German than ever before” – on a page illustrated with a picture of her re-enacting Caspar David Friedrich ur-German painting Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog . However, she finds it harder to grasp what being German really means. That sense of in-betweenness gave birth to a personal research project that came in three stages: over a period of two years, Krug regularly returned to her father hometown of Külsheim in Swabia, in the south-west, and combed through village archives, markets and junk shops. Over the next two years, she wrote up the tales she had discovered: the story of her fervently National Socialist uncle Franz-Karl, who died of a bullet to his chest in Italy aged or that of her grandfather Willi, who worked as a chauffeur for a Jewish salesman and voted for the Social Democrats in only to then join the Nazi party a few months later. In hindsight, Krug says, the family history she embarked on was the kind of project she wished she had done when she was much younger: “What I found problematic about the way in which we were taught at school about the Holocaust and the war was that it conveyed a very generalising sense of guilt. You learned about the facts, but you weren’t encouraged to research what happened in your own city, or your own family. “If that had happened, we would have learned to deal with this guilt in a much more constructive way. You would have been able to say: ‘I am doing something positive now, I am contributing to retelling the story in a new way.’ The sense of paralysis would not have been so strong.” In recent years, Germany new far-right party Alternative für Deutschland has started to agitate against what it calls the country Schuldkult – “guilt cult”. Railing against architect Peter Eisenman Holocaust memorial next to Berlin Brandenburg Gate, the AfD delegate Björn Höcke last year said that “we Germans are the only people in the world that have planted a monument of shame in the heart of their capital”. Has German culture exposed itself to attacks from the far right by putting the country collective guilt at the heart of its modern identity? Krug pauses to think. “I think there is now a backlash from people who say they are fed up with having to feel guilty. There a defensive attitude that can lead to the exact opposite. In my view, Germans still feel deeply insecure about all this.” While travelling frequently between the US and Germany, she says, she started a notebook to document behavioural oddities that she had previously been blind to. “For example, Germans apologise a lot less, whether that is for bumping into people in the road, or for graver things. To apologise in German entails an admission that you are guilty. In the English-speaking world, an apology doesn’t necessarily imply that: it can just mean ‘I didn’t intend that to happen’, and not ‘It is my fault’. An apology carries a lot of weight here.” But Krug rejects the idea that the guilt of Nazi Germany no longer applies to her own generation. “I don’t think we should no longer feel guilty. But there are paralysing ways to feel guilt and there are constructive strategies for coping with guilt, and we didn’t learn enough of the latter at school.” Heimat, the title of Krug book, is one of those terms whose prestige as an ultra-specific, “untranslatable” German word isn’t really deserved. The word, which was co-opted by National Socialist propaganda and only partially rehabilitated by Edgar Reitz arthouse soap opera, made in the and of the same name (of which Krug is a fan), oscillates between referring to a specific geographic location, a “homeland”, and a vaguer, more spiritual sense of “home-ness”. Germany current government announced in March this year that it would establish the first ever Heimat ministry , though appropriately for such a conceptually overloaded word, there has yet to be any announcement on what such a ministry would do. Krug approach, by contrast, is refreshingly materialist. For the final two-year stage of her project, Krug assembled the material she had amassed into a sprawling family album. The biographies of her relatives are told in a series of cartoon panels in the fairytale style of her first graphic novel, Red Riding Hood Redux , a Rashomon -style retelling of the story from the perspective of its five main characters. Krug biographies are interspersed with entries from what she calls “the notebook of a homesick émigré”, listing quintessentially German objects such as Hansaplast bandages, Leitz binders or dark and crusty sourdough bread, and her “scrapbook of a memory archivist”, in which she presents curios unearthed during her flea market treasure trawls. Sometimes, Krug uses these objects to undercut sarcastically the emotional pull of the individual biographies. Fly agaric toadstools, she notes, having just discovered her uncle grim school essay, are in Germany still seen as signs of good luck. In another chapter, an account of how all memory of Judaism as a living culture has been erased from her father hometown is interwoven with evidence of how the country tried to erase memory of the Nazi period after A stamp bearing Hitler portrait is relabelled “Germany contaminator” so as not to diminish its value. On a photograph of three young men in uniforms, the swastikas on their armbands have been scratched out. A graphic history of the rise of the Nazis The curious appeal of Krug graphic memoir is that it never fully loses itself in the act of storytelling but constantly stops to turn over and reassess the means at its disposal. “The research stage took so long because I was very insecure at first: how do you tell a story like this without being misunderstood?” she says. “I didn’t want to make the point that Germans were victims, too. If you made a film about this subject, you would have to be extremely careful what kind of music you used. The same applies to pictures: it can suddenly seem so very sentimental.” In the end, even a cosmopolitan young German writer living in New York cannot tell the story of Germany as a simple tale with a hero and a villain, a beginning and an end. “My Heimat,” Krug writes, “is an echo, a forgotten word once called into the mountains. An unrecognisable reverberation.” Heimat: A German Family Album is published by Particular.",1814,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/03/nora-krug-germany-nazi-past-heimat-memoir-author-illustrator
1,"More than a decade since his last book, Thomas Harris – author and creator of one of literature most famous monsters, the sophisticated, psychopathic cannibal Hannibal Lecter – is set to release a new novel. The as-yet-unnamed novel has long been anticipated since when Harris signed a reported eight-figure deal for two books. The first was Hannibal Rising, but no details of a second have ever been revealed. In his agent Mort Janklow told Entertainment Weekly : “I have no idea what Tom next book will be. It may not involve the Hannibal character at all. His deal does not require that. He is an important American novelist and writes what he chooses, when he chooses.” The novel, which was announced on Wednesday by publisher William Heinemann, is set for a global release on May The publisher described it as “standalone”, and confirmed that it will not involve Lecter. Jason Arthur, publisher at William Heinemann, said: “There is no doubt in my mind that Thomas Harris remains one of the most notable writers of the last four decades, and the publication of his first novel in years – his first non-Hannibal novel in over – will be a significant publishing event.” Harris has only written one non-Lecter book before: his debut Black Sunday, a thriller set around a planned terrorist attack on the Super Bowl, which was inspired by the Munich Olympics hostage crisis. His next four novels focused on the “great fictional monster of our time” , as horror author Stephen King once described Lecter. In his first appearance, Lecter played a small but memorable role in Red Dragon, advising FBI profiler Will Graham from his prison cell as the agent struggles to identify a serial killer. Even Harris found himself unnerved by his creation, recalling in that he was “not comfortable in the presence of Dr Lecter, not sure at all that the doctor could not see me”. The novel was a hit, as was the sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, which also starred Lecter in a supporting role to FBI hopeful Clarice Starling. After the adaptation starring Anthony Hopkins as Lecter and Jodie Foster as Starling became one of only three films ever to win the “Big Five” Oscars , Harris became a bestselling author and Lecter went front and centre. In Harris sequel Hannibal saw Starling track down Lecter in Italy, while the prequel Hannibal Rising, revealed the makings of the character while escaping the Nazis as a child in Lithuania. Hannibal Rising had an astronomical initial print run of copies, but did not receive the same critical acclaim as the others. In the Guardian, Steven Poole said he had the “dismaying thought that, after the brilliantly taut and claustrophobic procedurals earlier in the series, Harris has finally morphed into an upmarket version of Dan Brown”. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , the producer of the film version Dino de Laurentiis implied he had pressured Harris to write the prequel, saying: “I say to Thomas, ‘If you don’t do [the prequel], I will do it with someone else ... I don’t want to lose this franchise. And the audience wants it.’ He said, ‘No. I’m sorry.’ And I said, ‘I will do it with somebody else.’ And then he said, ‘Let me think about it. I will come up with an idea.’” Despite his bestselling status, Harris has not been in the public eye for some time, as he does not do interviews and divides his time between homes in south Florida and Long Island. In a telephone conversation with New York magazine , he said that though he was happy to answer fan mail and pose for pictures, he didn’t enjoy interviews: “So I just work and I try to put things in my books that I want to say.” In a characteristically brief statement with the announcement of his new book, Harris described himself as “very pleased”.",655,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/03/hannibal-lecter-creator-thomas-harris-announces-first-book-in-13-years
2,"itting in a coffee shop just around the corner from the publishers, Canongate, of which Christopher Bland had once been chair, members of Christopher family and of the Royal Society of Literature were brainstorming a title for the new prize to be announced in his name. “Late writers” risked conjuring up the dead, while “older writers” raised the question of what, in an industry that is often obsessed with youth, would be considered old: Google this query and you will find writers over bemoaning the fact that they will soon be over the hill. In the end we opted for a prize in Christopher name, to be awarded to a first novel or work of non-fiction published when the winner is or older. Not before, however, we had worried about the quality of future entrants: what kind of writer, we wondered, apart from Christopher, who published two novels while in his would be eligible for such a prize? Look no further than a list of greats that starts almost before the novel was a “thing” with Daniel Defoe , who, having written hundreds of pamphlets and journal articles, published his first long work of fiction, Robinson Crusoe, in – just before his birthday. And then there are the many contemporary writers who, having come to the craft late, wrote books that earned them places in the canon of British literature. Richard Adams was when Watership Down was published (he went on to write more books, the last when he was Mary Wesley was when her first of three children books were published, and when her first adult novel, Jumping the Queue, came out – and was quickly followed by the smash hit The Camomile Lawn when she was (she wrote another eight novels, the last published a year before her death at Frank McCourt shot to writing fame with Angela Ashes when he was and Laura Ingalls Wilder series of “little houses in” books was inaugurated by The Little House in the Big Woods when she was And finally Raymond Chandler , who, perhaps more than any other, made me want to be a writer. Chandler started life as an accountant, restricted his writing to – in his opinion, “terrible” – reporting and “Grade B Georgian poetry”, lost his job in the Great Depression, paid to take a writing correspondence course, began sending short stories to the pulp magazines when he was in his late and finally published The Big Sleep, his first novel, when he was Chandler was a famously slow writer, and a consummate craftsman, who once said that: “Everything a writer learns about the art or craft of fiction, takes just a little away from his need or desire to write at all. In the end he knows all the tricks and has nothing to say.” I was reminded of this when Christopher Bland joined the six-month novel-writing course I was teaching. Any biography of Christopher will list the organisations of which he was chair – almost numerous enough to furnish the small cafe where we were meeting to discuss the prize. They included chairing London Weekend Television, the boards of governors of the BBC, British Telecom and the Royal Shakespeare Company. Christopher bought none of this boast-worthy past into his writing present. And yet the scope and ambition of his writing – and also his fierce concentration – said something, not only about the man, but also about how his life experiences fed his writing. Like Chandler he had lived, and like Chandler and many other older writers, some of whom I hope soon to read, the writing became the one thing worth perfecting.

3,"really successful poetry anthology needs two essential ingredients: pace and rhythm. The editor has to think hard about which poems are put together and how they relate to each other. Much of the challenge is working on the order and identifying certain poems that act as breathers to achieve the right tempo. And then there the central thrust around which a selection of poems can be made. The idea of a poem therapeutic power is at the heart of The Poetry Pharmacy , an anthology I put together last year after touring the country prescribing poems for ailments of the human spirit. Since childhood, in my loneliest or most tumultuous hours, I have found solace in identifying the perfect poem for the moment. Although I still hunt in secondhand bookshops, the Pharmacy, which started as a live event at festivals, has led readers to share their experiences and recommendations with me. Seeing the difference the right poem can make has given me confidence in poetry power to change lives. It has also informed my choices here. Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times edited by Neil Astley This anthology - the first in a series of three from poetry press Bloodaxe - deserves its years as a bestseller, a lucky dip of work by poets from all over the world, themed around the needs that draw people to poetry at life turning points: growing pains, love, breakup, loss. Not long ago, a condensed version of the trilogy made it on to the World Book Night giveaway list: the anthologies hit home wherever people had troubles – in shelters, prisons and hospitals. My favourite response? “The right poem gives you something else to talk about, not just your case notes. It makes you feel human.” Poems That Make Grown Men Cry edited by Anthony and Ben Holden I love being introduced to a poem by someone to whom it matters deeply. This anthology began with a conversation between Anthony Holden and the scholar-critic Frank Kermode, about the difference between true sentiment and mawkishness, and the pros and cons of men weeping. It delivers twice over: I relish reading an unfamiliar Seamus Heaney poem with Richard Curtis, or John le Carré choice of Goethe, because the sharing of a poem is such an intimate act. When you know which poems move a person – and there an excellent Poems That Make Women Cry, too – you glimpse who they might be, late at night, alone. England: Poems from a School, edited by Kate Clanchy Clanchy teaches at a small Oxford comprehensive school where languages are spoken: “We tell the students that girls are good at football, that the library is the most important place in the school and that poetry is for everyone.” Her pupils treat English like a freshly minted currency: the poems that fill this exhilarating book are the fruit of their wide reading, rereading and editing. When stuck for a phrase, form or image, they raid their stores of Farsi, Arabic, Nepalese or turn to Rumi, Mahmoud Darwish, Ocean Vuong. “My beloved mother. / When I go to my house, the pain of missing her / Arrives before me” is by a from Syria and is just one of many similarly powerful verses. A Poem for Every Day of the Year, edited by Allie Esiri This is a really fine family anthology: just leave it around in the house and see how often everyone, not just the children, turns to it. It works as a kind of journal: there are poems for Christmas, Valentine and Armistice Days, but also for Martin Luther King Day, for Diwali, the spring solstice. Best of all, it not solemn. The most frequently cited poets are Stevenson, Longfellow, Hardy and Dickinson, Wendy Cope and that shape-shifter, Anon. Esiri excellent companion volume, A Poem for Every Night of the Year, needs to be kept by the bed, obviously. Poetry for a Change; A National Poetry Day Anthology, illustrated by Chie Hosaka The theme of change threads through the poems in this charmingly illustrated little book. Each of its contributors presents one of their own poems, alongside one of their favourite classic poems. You can flip from a Yeats (He mourns for the Change that has come upon him and his Beloved and longs for the End of the World) to Abigail Parry Instructions for Not Becoming a Werewolf. Irresistible, for all ages. Bad Kid Catullus, edited by Jon Stone and Kirsten Irving Stone and Irving, the two poets responsible for Sidekick Books – a tiny publisher specialising in irresistible anthologies that double as compendia of jokes, puzzles, teases, weird lists and doodle pages – outdid themselves last year with this anthology of new and old poems inspired by ancient Rome filthiest wordsmith, Catullus. Certain concrete poems are X-rated, but if acrobatic acrostics and saucy experiments with form tickle your fancy, this is just the book for a weekend of Latin love. Forward Book of Poetry foreword by Bidisha Each year, the judges of the Forward prizes read virtually every new collection published in the UK and Ireland and choose their favourites for this book. The current edition includes work by American wunderkinder Danez Smith and Kaveh Akbar, Liz Berry wonderful The Republic of Motherhood and hot new Faber writer Richard Scott. I may be biased as the prizes’ founder, but I had absolutely no hand in the judging, which was done by a five-strong jury chaired by Bidisha. For a one-volume overview of what current in poetry, this is indispensable. The Poem Is You: Contemporary American Poems and How to Read Them, by Stephen Burt I don’t know enough about the US poetry scene, but Stephen – now Steph – Burt, a poet and Harvard professor, is a fabulous guide. His selection takes us from the early – led by the likes of John Ashbery and Czesław Miłosz – to movers and shakers of today such as Claudia Rankine and Terrance Hayes. Each poem is introduced by an essay sketching out how it works, why it matters, how it speaks to the wider worlds of art and culture. If only a publisher with antennae tuned to the nuances of the current UK poetry boom were brave enough to commission an equivalent. From Catullus to Dylan Thomas: the top elegies Poems on the Underground, edited by Judith Chernaik, Gerard Benson and Cicely Herbert If you’ve ever been on a London tube, this book needs no introduction. Over the years, the much imitated initiative has saved tens of thousands of frazzled travellers from seething fury. There nothing like a fragment of Sappho, John Donne, Philip Larkin, Derek Walcott or Louis MacNeice to remind you that the world is “crazier and more of it than we think / Incorrigibly plural”. Hook, Line and Singer, by Cerys Matthews I love the way Matthews weaves poetry into everything she does. So while, strictly speaking, this is a book of songs, it perfect for all who don’t realise how much poetry they already know and love. The musical arrangements are opposite the words, reminding me how much of a poem power lies in its music rather than any “deep” meaning.

4,"We now have a complete shortlist for the Not the Booker prize. Our excellent panel of judges from last year have added Three Dreams in the Key of G by Marc Nash , as our wildcard entry. It sounds like a daring experimental novel that should add considerable interest to our list – but don’t take it from me, take it from our three judges: Hannah Bruce calls it “a truly unique book – a tour de force of advanced literature. Nash manages to intertwine three interesting narrators, while also expressing the emotion of science. Three Dreams is a book capable of standing out in any collection or shortlist, and will likely not be forgotten.” Yvain Poncet says: “Three Dreams is a unique book, challenging and rewarding in equal measures. The style is ambitious, the novel accomplished. The form and the development of the (very different) inner voices displays the author willingness to push the boundaries of his writing, and to explore territories that could only be so through a novel. I can’t wait to hear this year judges take on our choice.” And Jackie Law (who has also written a detailed review on her blog ) writes: “Three Dreams is playful and clever in its use of language, of science, and its portrayal of relationships. It observes man habits and thinking, offering the reasoning of inner voices that rarely find clear expression. The interplay of words and their multiple meanings weave together the three strands of the story. The writing is rich, at times complex, but ultimately entertaining.” So our complete shortlist now looks like this: Sealed by Naomi Booth Dark Pines by Will Dean Raising Sparks by Ariel Kahn Sweet Fruit, Sour Land by Rebecca Ley The Ruin by Dervla McTiernan Three Dreams in the Key of G by Marc Nash As we’re reading in alphabetical order, I’ll be reviewing Sealed by Naomi Booth next week, with a review to follow each week. I hope you’ll join me, especially because we are once again on the look out for judges. If you like the way things are shaping up so far – or even if you want to change things – this is your big chance to influence the competition. Our judges are always a vital part of our process – and their wisdom always makes the discussions more lively. It so good to hear from avid readers that I don’t even mind that much that most judges tend to disagree with my opinions – I’m even prepared to admit that things are much improved as a result. Anyway, you can see our past judges in action by clicking through to these videos from , , , and . That a very decent five years! We’ll be delighted if you want to throw your hat into the ring, too. All you need to do is follow the gospel of our pure and serene terms and conditions : Three readers will be selected by the Guardian to form a panel of judges from those readers who have made substantial contributions to the discussion of the shortlisted books. The process by which these readers are chosen is also left studiously vague and at the Guardian discretion.

5,"Dervla McTiernan path to publication has been unusually smooth. That not the same as easy. She clearly had to put in plenty of hard yards, writing at nights after finishing up at her day job and putting her children to bed. But still. She says she started writing in earnest in having given herself five years to make a go of it – but that within just two years (by early December she found herself the subject of publishing auction and signed up for a two-book deal . “It helped,” she has said , “that I had a story, or at least the beginning of one. It was a single image, really. A girl, Maude Blake, sits on the stairs in a crumbling Georgian country house. She holding hands with her little brother, Jack, who only five. It getting dark outside, and they are afraid. Without writing a word I knew who Maude was, knew how deeply she loved her brother, what she had done to protect him. I knew, too, that things had reached a crisis point. I had to write the book to find out what happened next.” This scene is where The Ruin opens, and I can understand why it attracted publishers’ attention. There real emotional power as an uncertain and nervous young policeman called Cormac Reilly finds the pair alone in that mouldering house, with their mother dead in a bed upstairs and the children already packed in preparation for being taken away. “There was something so utterly pathetic about the two little bags,” thinks Cormac, and you can just see it. When McTiernan moves the action forward years to a flat in Galway, it equally involving. Adult Jack discovers his partner is pregnant, a precarious situation as trainee doctor Aisling feels it could hurt her chances of becoming a surgeon. There are no histrionics; the couple talk it over quietly and lovingly, in a way that feels intimate and real. Which makes it all the more tragic when Jack goes out, doesn’t come home, and we’re told he killed himself. Aisling grappling with grief is impressively and empathetically written, and for a while it feels as if this is going to be a very sensitive and well-written crime novel. So it a shame when these affecting scenes give way to a rather more plodding police procedural, as Cormac finds himself investigating that death again, and Aisling and Maude team up to find out what has happened to Jack in the present. There an intriguing amount of perplexity as the story gets rolling, but this uncertainty soon starts to feel overplayed. “There was an agenda at play here,” we’re told. “There something here, I have a feeling,” we hear later. “This one is different for you, isn’t it?” Cormac wife remarks. There also a fair bit of cooked-to-a-crisp dialogue: ‘Jesus,’ Maude said. ‘Your arrogance. You think you know everything, and you know nothing.’ ‘I know enough. I know that this bloody quest of yours is about you, not about Jack. You’re trying to redeem yourself. Trying to make up for all the years you wasted. Well you can’t do that, Maude. There no going back. And nothing you do, nothing I do, will change the fact that Jack is dead.’ Too many of the plot mechanics feel equally clunky. It very fortunate that Maude hasn’t tried to contact her brother for years, and also happens to have to spare, even though she been working in a sheep station in Australia. (We’re given explanations for both – and both are unconvincing.) Elsewhere, there are strange jolts towards the end of the book, as hitherto peripheral characters take over the narrative focus – a decision that only adds to the confusion as there are already too many minor characters flitting about. More crucially (and I hope this isn’t too much of a spoiler), the villain here is absurd. The portrayal is both inconsistent and over-the-top, deflating most of the tension that McTiernan set up so skilfully in the novel early pages. There still enough sympathetic writing and talent on display to make you stick with The Ruin, but in the end it feels frustrating and unsatisfying. It turns out that that “what happened next” wasn’t quite as intriguing as that powerful opening.

6,"ave you heard of my mum Tracy Beaker?… Everyone knows her,” announces narrator Jess. So begins Jacqueline Wilson latest book, her – possibly, “I lost count around she says. A generation of (mostly) girls grew up reading the novels and watching the hit TV series about the misadventures of Wilson best-loved heroine battling her way through life in a children home – referred to as the Dumping Ground. Now, years after The Story of Tracy Beaker was published, Tracy is back, a single mum in her late living on the Duke estate, between jobs and dating a former footballer. With a reunion of old friends – Tracy long-suffering foster mum Cam, bully boy “Football” and even “Justine Enemy-Forever Littlewood”, My Mum Tracy Beaker will appeal not only to Wilson devoted fans but also to their mums. But even before the book release, Wilson is getting the sort of flak that has often accompanied her rise to become one of the UK most successful children authors. The pre-publicity revealed that the novel opens in Tracy cosy council flat and there were grumbling tweets along the lines of: “Oh typical, doesn’t Jacqueline Wilson think that looked-after children can ever be a big success?” “Well, being realistic,” says Wilson with a faint weariness, “I wanted it to be London-based, and which person out of any background can afford a wonderful house by the time of Tracy age?” Unless, she adds, “you are going to have some fairytale thing like she an actress or a bestselling novelist, or something like that? It did bother me that the only way to make a success of yourself is to become a celebrity. Occasionally this happens, not often.” As anyone familiar with Wilson own story – timid girl from “a perfectly ordinary” Kingston council estate, sells over books, becomes a dame and children laureate – will know, that what happened to her. “Well, it did kind of,” she agrees. “The right sort of celebrity, I think. If you are a child of a certain age, or if you are a teacher, or if you were a big fan of my books right from when I first started writing, you might well recognise me, but for most people ...” That said, she has a good story about putting on an impromptu play for the Queen birthday bash with JK Rowling. “In front of people – plus royalty. We bonded tremendously – as you do!” But looking around the busy basement cafe in Waterstones Piccadilly where we are chatting: “We’re in a bookshop, people haven’t got a clue!” They may just be being polite: dressed in buttercup yellow rather than her usual black (she has been dubbed a “goth granny”), with her trademark silver rings, silvery crop and specs, she certainly distinctive. You wouldn’t guess that she has been seriously ill – “big heart problems, big kidney problems. Touch wood, I’m fine now.” She can do a neat self-portrait in the style of her long-term illustrator Nick Sharratt, to whom this new novel is dedicated. They have been together since the publication of The Story of Tracy Beaker in with “never a cross word – isn’t that nice!” His perky, pin-dot-eyed drawings are part of the Wilson brand, the covers instantly recognisable. When children write to her – which they do in vast numbers – they often assume they live together. “In a very chaste way”, just as “people used to think the Blue Peter people all lived together in a nice little house with the dog.” They do often holiday together. Wilson writes an impressive two books a year, and Tracy is one of the few characters who has stayed with her. “She become – this sounds fey – almost a real person to me,” she admits. At events, where her long signing queues are legendary, Tracy is a failsafe for parents and children alike (“Boys don’t mind liking her too,” she says, “she a very fun, tough character”). If Wilson favourite theme is the triumph of the plucky underdog, My Mum Tracy Beaker is also a celebration of the early relationship between mothers and daughters, before everything is hijacked by hormones. She wanted to make it plain, she says, that “just because Tracy might not have had the best mother in the world, or that just because you had a life in and out of care, it doesn’t mean that you couldn’t be the best parent ever.” Wilson is an only child but always wanted to have lots of children, to become “an earth mother”, but she, her grandmother, mother and her daughter Emma are all only children. She published books before Tracy , and is grateful that things didn’t really take off until Emma, now a Cambridge academic and author, was older. Her marriage ended at around the same time. She has no hankerings to be a grandmother, because “I did it all and it was lovely”. With books that deal with abandonment ( Dustbin Baby ), bipolar disorder ( The Illustrated Mum ), bereavement ( My Sister Jodie ), divorce ( Candyfloss ), stepfamilies ( Lizzie Zipmouth ), Wilson didn’t earn her reputation as queen of kids’ grit-fic for nothing, and even her friends tease her with parody titles. There no shortage of grimness in children fiction today, but when Wilson was first writing there was a gap on the library shelves between the ginger-beer world of Enid Blyton and slightly scary YA fiction; her books came as a relief to any child disappointed to discover no one played lacrosse at their comp. As a child she found that only Eve Garnett novel The Family from One End Street , in which the mum took in washing and the dad was a dustman, showed her that “it was possible to write that sort of book”. Her work is fairly innocent by modern standards; not that you’d think so from the fuss. “People say: ‘Oh that Jacqueline Wilson. All that sex and drugs.’ No sex, no drugs. Not at all!” Wilson says emphatically. “If there is violence it is nearly always off the page, and not dwelt upon. I can’t help thinking my books are quite moral, because if there is a message it is: be kind to people, even if they are a bit of an odd one out.” Her default position is to see things from her readers’ perspective, which is why they love her in return. But this can create problems. While her books have touched on online safety, anorexia and coming out, there are some issues she has avoided, such as self-harming, which “seems to be horrifyingly prevalent”. The idea that cutting in some way “relieves feelings of anger or fear – if I just wrote that once,” she explains, “who knows if one child somewhere might think, well shall I try it? You’ve got to be so careful.” She is protective of her own private life, or “little bits of your personality ebb away from you”. It wouldn’t do at all, she says, for her ever to be seen swearing or drunk in public - not that you can imagine it. “It as if there me, but there the professional me standing side by side,” she says. And she has to resist her role as unofficial agony aunt: at a Q&amp;A at the last London Book Fair, even adults in the audience were asking her advice. “It was very flattering that they thought I had any answers,” she says. “When you think about children writers, I mean in the past, like JM Barrie or Kenneth Grahame , they were not the most balanced, upbeat people.” We are “much more aware of child psychology and what can be really upsetting for children” than when she first wrote about Tracy, she thinks. But that doesn’t mean things are easier. The pressure on girls to look a certain way has been magnified by social media: on visits to secondary schools she is struck by how girls practise their selfie faces and all have the same long, glossy hair. “How do they do that? And no spots! It is so sad that what you look like is considered the most important thing in the world.” ‘It was almost an&nbsp;advantage for me not&nbsp;to have had a typical, pleasant middle-class upbringing’ She has a knack of keeping up, without ever sounding cringe-makingly “down with the kids”: you won’t find an “innit” in her pages (there was a bit of a to-do over the word “twat” a few years back); she wants her characters to talk colloquially, but not “like, literally”. And she avoids mentioning apps and social media because “children are so fickle” when it comes to technology. She likes to give her readers “positive” endings if not always straightforwardly happy ones. My Mum Tracy Beaker only flirts with the modern fairytale of becoming a footballer wife, living in a mansion and driving a flash car. If the novel has a “message” it is that “you can be a happy, fulfilled person and have achieved a lot, but you don’t have to have fame and riches, as Tracy always wanted.” Her own childhood was “not a tranquil one”. Her father, a civil servant, was “very melancholy and very moody” and she was frightened of his rages until he died; her mother was “a most interesting but not a maternal woman”. She describes herself as a “very anxious” child, who used to suffer what her mother called “‘bilious attacks” and was always sick on the first day of the holidays. Today, she sees it as “almost an advantage not to have had a typical, pleasant middle-class upbringing with parents who liked each other and siblings and everything, like in a story book”. The rest of the story is well known: like her collection of elaborate rings (one for each book, inspired by Flower Fairies writer Cicely Mary Barker), the anecdotes have been polished over years of doing what she calls “her little routines” on stage , assuming an almost fairy-tale sheen of their own. There Jackie magazine, for example , where she landed a job before it was launched and which, as legend has it, was named after her. Although “every second hairdresser was called Jackie in the sixties,” she says now (She Jacky, with a “y”). And “life has come full circle” because the same publisher now brings out the Jacqueline Wilson Magazine, “which is perfect!” For years, she would write a strict words a day, after swimming lengths in the local pool, but she has “decided to be kinder to myself”, aiming for between and words, in bed each morning. On this she is unrelenting: “I am really obsessive – Christmas Day, whenever.” She says: “I don’t know whether you are just closer to your dream world and your subconscious.” She still worries with “every single book”, that it won’t all come together. “There a bit of me that thinks ‘Oh god, they will say I’m just repeating myself?’, or ‘she lost it’.” She has no plans to let up on the two books a year, and surely we haven’t heard the last from Tracy Beaker. “Jess has got a lot of potential,” she agrees. “We’ll wait and see.” And a film of Four Children and It , her tribute to E Nesbit classic, will be released next year. She has a “teeny weeny” part – “but I do have a line!” A life-long townie, she has recently moved to East Sussex, and “adores” being in the country and by the sea. If you were to visit her house, she says, you would find “loads and loads of books”. She also collects toys and “upstairs you would find quite a lot of dolls, teddy type animals or a doll house”. She has a rocking horse, too, a birthday present from a friend. “I do actually go on it. It is really sturdy,” she says matter of factly. If you didn’t have some things as a child, she muses, you want to have them as an adult: it no surprise to learn she wasn’t allowed any jewellery when she was young. She remembers reading about how John Lennon, “who didn’t have the happiest of upbringings”, tried to recreate his childhood things in a room. She had the opportunity to do just that in when the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood in east London recreated her bedroom as part of an exhibition about her life. Her intense memories of what it felt like to be a girl perhaps explain her gift for getting it right for children since. Now, at she “having the best time” of her life: “You don’t know how much time you’ve got left. How awful if you are lying there on your deathbed thinking: ‘If only I’d done more of that.’” Would even the imaginative Jacqueline ever have believed how things would work out? “No. Absolutely not. And yet,” she pauses. “I had quite a long walk to school and would pretend to be a famous writer and that people were interviewing me.” My Mum Tracy Beaker is published by Doubleday Childrens on October.",2189,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/29/jacqueline-wilson-tracy-beaker-interview
7,"en Fountain election year essays for the Guardian have been expanded into a new book which tries to make sense of what happened and where America stands today. Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point and Outliers, first wrote about Fountain in an article for the New Yorker titled Late Bloomers in which he called Fountain a genius. They sat down this week in Brooklyn, New York, to talk Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and the American psyche. Land of the free? How Trump has put America identity in peril Malcolm Gladwell Ben, you have written this extraordinary book, Beautiful Country Burn Again . Why don’t you start just by explaining the title. Ben Fountain Beautiful Country Burn Again. I came across those words in Joan Didion South and West book, which is essentially a notebook of hers on notes about the south and west of the United States. It was a reference to the current spate of wildfires going on in California at the time, I think. There was this line, “beautiful country burn again”. I thought: “My God, that wonderful.” It popped up again in my head when I was writing this book and I thought: “That it. We do have a beautiful country. Is it burning again? Will it have to burn again?” Then someone pointed out to me that those lines were actually from a California poet named Robinson Jeffers, and it a poem called Apology for Bad Dreams. There are these wonderful lines in there: “Beautiful country burn again. Point Pinos down to the Sur rivers. Burn again with bitter wonders. Land and ocean and the Carmel water.” Those are haunting lines. MG The great project of the book is to situate the Trump phenomenon very clearly in the mainstream of American history. You paint it as the quintessential American story. It almost like we should not be surprised at what happened. BF Right. Not be surprised, but I think it takes some thought and some reading and some analysis to reach that conclusion. When you’re living in the moment with little or no background, you do think: “Where did this come from? We seem to be in uncharted waters.” And so, if you’re a person like me, who is bookish, and has the opportunity and things come together that allow me to take a deep dive into all this, well, I did my deep dive and this is what I came up with. MG The book deals with lots of dark and depressing things, and yet the book is not dark and depressing. You clearly enjoyed it, and the book has a high-spirited feel to it by the end. BF I enjoy seeing the humor in things … I think it a valid way to look at politics, I mean, so much of it is absurd and dumb and just so nakedly careerist and self-aggrandizing, that you just have to laugh at these people sometimes. MG There a wonderful description early in the book of a Trump speech, which is as fine a piece of writing as I have read in a very, very, very long time. But I felt you have, on some level, an affection. He such an extraordinary character. Is that unfair of me to say that? BF He has a genuine raw power. He has a very powerful personality, and when you are in a gymnasium with him, you feel it. He is a master of the psyche and he a master at connecting with people and he makes you feel very special. I mean, in that gymnasium in Iowa in January, I was trying to think, what speaker have I ever seen who could forge such a visceral connection with so many people in so short a time? And you could just feel it in the air. So, when the event was over, people were happy, they were smiling. That a sure sign it been a great success. They didn’t just wander off, like, “OK, now it time for dinner”. It was like they had been through something. MG But you’re subtly evading my question, which is am I wrong in reading a little bit of … You take a certain delight in him. BF Well, yes, I do. A morbid delight. You have to acknowledge the showmanship and the raw talent and the effectiveness of what he doing. And I was watching to see my own reaction, like, would I be taken by him on some level? I was half expecting to, and I walked out of there really depressed, really sad. I just felt bad. Everybody else felt great. MG You make your politics leanings obvious. Did the process of doing this editing, of doing this reporting increase or decrease your affection for Hillary [Clinton]? BF Both, I guess. I will say, and this is true of almost all the politicians I came across, when I was in their presence – it weird – I felt a strange tenderness for them, because in some ways they seemed very vulnerable. And they are flesh and blood and they’re putting themselves out there to do this thing that might well destroy them. I felt that way with Hillary Clinton. I did not feel that way with Ted Cruz . I just, I have a very low opinion of him, and we can leave it at that. Hillary has done a lot of good things and she has worked hard for a lot of good things. She has also aligned herself very much with the power establishment of this country that has degraded the lives of working-class people and middle-class people in this country for the last years. So, that is a very heavy thing to weigh against all the good things she done. MG Did your own politics evolve over the course of doing this book? BF Yeah. Became more radical. Farther left. I feel like the working and middle classes of this country have gotten the shaft over the last or years, and part and parcel of that has been a very effective sales job on the mind of America, this hard sell of free-market fundamentalism. It has benefited a few people at the top and there been scant trickle-down. It made me angrier. We are not just units of production for some higher power to get the maximum economic benefit they can out of us Ben Fountain Also, the center in American political life has shifted so far to the right. Just me standing still, I felt like I was moving farther and farther to the left. I mean, Eisenhower Republicanism is basically Democratic socialism. I mean, he expanded social security, he inaugurated the interstate highway system, he was very much in favor of collective bargaining and he pushed back against the military-industrial complex. I mean, those are all things we would associate more with somebody like Bernie Sanders these days. So, I think I just recognized the center has shifted so far in American politics, and left me standing there as a hardcore leftie. A large part of America, poor people, working-class people, middle-class people, immigrants, they are trying to insist on their humanity, insist on their reality. We are not just units of production for some higher power to get the maximum economic benefit they can out of us. Our humanity is just as important as anyone else, and there are powerful forces working against that. MG Last question. Do you have any ambitions for the book? What do you hope it does? BF It hard to change people minds with information and rational arguments. I think what really changes people are experiences. Beautiful Country Burn Again review: Trump, and America 'long con' I hope that people who are looking for answers, I hope they could turn to this book and feel like this is an honest attempt to try to find, one writer trying to find his way towards some answers. Even if he doesn’t have the answers, perhaps his writing is a useful thing to think with and keep in mind, as this reader is processing his or her own experience. In terms of bringing fiction techniques to non-fiction, art, when it really working is the right piece of art, the right person at the right time. It more in the nature of an experience than information. I mean, works of art do change people. They can be so powerful and profound. So, perhaps, I do have a hope that for some people there will be elements of an experience in there, and maybe that will help them get more understanding. MG That lovely, Ben. Thank you.

8,"n at the start of the Reagan years, photographer Janet Delaney decamped from the South of Market – or SoMa – neighbourhood in her beloved San Francisco , where she had lived since her teens, to a new home in the Mission district. Aged just she had spent the previous few years documenting social change and gentrification in SoMa. “I was using a large format camera on a tripod, so I had to put my head under a black cloth to take a photograph, which made me feel very conspicuous,” she says. “It was kind of formal.” She wanted a more “fluid” experience of street life, and in Mission that is exactly what she got. It was a turbulent time and protests and parades were playing an increasingly important part in the daily life of the primarily Latino district, which was also home to sizeable gay and African American communities. “We were responding to a radical change in political perspective not unlike what we are feeling now,” says Delaney, speaking from her home in Berkeley, California, just across San Francisco bay. “Anyone who, like me, came of age during the age of Aquarius, the summer of love, the ever hopeful was just thrown off balance by the political shift that happened as the Reagan era came in. In San Francisco there was a really strong backlash against the invasion of countries such as Nicaragua and Grenada. People were angry that Star Wars was using up a huge amount of money, abortion rights were being cut back and Reagan was refusing to provide funds towards finding a cure for Aids. So it was not dissimilar to the rollback of civil liberties we are experiencing again under Trump. There was plenty to talk about and parading, marching and protesting was one of the main ways to do it. We didn’t have the internet then.” Delaney, who began her career taking photographs in war-torn Central America, found herself taking to the streets of Mission whenever she had a spare moment, with a smaller, less conspicuous camera slung around her neck. This allowed her to move almost invisibly through the crowds. “I was really enamoured of the parades and protests and the spirit they encapsulated. And with the smaller camera – it was a twin-lens reflex like the one Diane Arbus used – I could just sidle up to people and take a photograph. It was an exercise in relaxing a bit, just recording what was going on around me on the streets and taking it in,” Delaney says. Now published together for the first time, her photographs lead us in and out of crowds, through demonstrators, street parties, dancers, cross-dressers, union organisers, beauty contestants and Bible-toting Christian children. Gay men in girl scout uniforms protest against the contras. Mothers and children march for “Peace, Jobs and Justice”. Among them, Delaney finds intimate moments as well as collective voices. Surprisingly, Delaney never intended the photographs to be published. “I was really just taking them as an act of love for my neighbourhood, as you might document a family, and then putting them away,” she says. For two decades, during which she married, raised two children and pursued other projects, they lay in a box, which ended up in the attic of her Berkeley home. They were rescued only recently, alongside her SoMa photographs – now also published in book form – when she bought a state-of-the-art scanner capable of turning them into digital files. Why publish now? “It seems to me that the concerns of the Reagan era have returned,” she says. “The parallels are remarkable. Here we are, post-Obama, which was probably one of the more hopeful periods in our history, once again feeling as if the rug has been pulled out from under our feet.” As the anger has returned, so too have the protests and parades. But do they make a difference? Delaney thinks so. “I can’t run the numbers but I think the purpose of protests is manifold, not least of which is to energise the people who are in them and to generate a collective sense of responsibility so that we are not just isolated in our own worlds.” Public Matters by Janet Delaney is published by Mack,",709,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/30/public-matters-photography-janet-delaney-san-francisco-interview
9,"n Jason Lutes , a cartoonist with just one slim graphic novel to his name, was leafing through a magazine in the house he shared in Seattle when his eye fell on an advertisement for a book of photographs about Bertolt Brecht Berlin. The ad briefly described the German capital in the with its wild cabarets, seedy bars and jostling population of artists, architects, writers and philosophers, and in as long as it took him to read it, his life was changed. Lutes had never visited Berlin. He knew almost nothing about the city beyond what the copywriter at this university press had to say about it. But, no matter. Here it was in black and white: his next project. The plan – it came to him in an instant – was to write an epic comic about the end of the Weimar republic and the beginnings of Nazism. It would be pages long and he would publish it in three instalments. “It was quite a commitment to make at the age of he says, wryly. “At that point, admittedly, I only thought it would take me years to do [in fact, the book took more than two decades to finish; the complete edition is published this month ]. But even so, I don’t recognise the person who did that strange thing.” Was it hard to keep going? “Yes. About halfway, there were financial struggles, other pressures. I did think of giving up and doing something else. But I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself if I hadn’t followed through on it.” It was before Lutes finally travelled to Berlin, a trip that, until the moment he landed, was fraught with anxiety (he was terrified that once he saw the city, the work he had already done would be “scattered to the wind”). For the first four years, he had drawn his visual inspiration entirely from photographs, something that was difficult before the advent of Google image search. “Most books of photographs show only the most dramatic pictures – the Brandenburg Gate, say, or the Reichstag – whereas my goal was to take a street-level view. I wanted to know what a four-poster bed in a working-class Berlin apartment might have looked like; I wanted to know about the alleys, not the major streets.” I didn’t want to be fatalistic, for the reader to feel: that the only way history could have gone Jason Lutes But there were other, self-imposed limitations. The better to prevent hindsight from creeping in, he did not allow himself to look at any images taken after when the Nazis came to power. For the same reason, he also avoided Charlie Chaplin The Great Dictator , and, later on, Oliver Hirschbiegel film, Downfall , which depicts the last days of Nazi rule, when Hitler was restricted to his Berlin bunker. At first, Lutes hoped to deploy a “highbrow thematic notion” in his unlikely masterwork. His two most important characters were to be a journalist, Kurt Severing, who bears a distant but pleasing resemblance to Hergé Tintin, whom Lutes adored as a boy, and an art student, Marthe Müller, who has newly arrived from Cologne; through these two and their preoccupation with words and pictures respectively, he would explore not only Berlin but the medium of comics itself. He laughs. “Luckily, that fell by the wayside. They became real characters, not just stand-ins for ideas.” They also became part of a larger crowd (the book has a cast of around among them a cross-dressing lesbian, a Jewish family and several working-class leftists, as well as a small number of the historically recognisable, Joseph Goebbels and Josephine Baker included. But if such a roll-call was intended to evoke the excitements of Berlin in the jazz age, and thus of the burgeoning modernity that would be snuffed out so brutally in Lutes was careful not to overplay his hand. For a long time, no swastikas can be found in Berlin ; not until the final quarter does one appear. “As a symbol, it had tremendous weight then,” says Lutes. “But nowhere near what it came to have in the following years. I didn’t want to be fatalistic, for the reader to feel: that the only way history could have gone.” What he knows now, however, is that most readers, if not all, see the symbol anyway; when they look back through the book and realise there is only a white space where a swastika should be, they’re all amazement. “Some media spell everything out,” he says. “But in comics there is space into which the reader has to project. When you put two panels next to each other, it the reader who has to make the connection both between them, as well as between the words and the pictures inside the panel.” He wonders now if he might have been even more restrained. “There is some early foreshadowing that I regret. David Schwartz, the Jewish boy who has a dream with an eagle in it… I didn’t actually need to do that.” When Lutes began work on his book, he was a “starving artist” and Bill Clinton was the American president; by the time he came to draw its final pages, he was a father of two, a professor at the Center for Cartoon Studies in Hartford, Vermont, and Donald Trump was installed in the White House. Antisemitism was on the rise across Europe, populist rightwing parties having made political gains almost everywhere. “It a horrible kind of good fortune,” he says of this shift, one he knows will change the way new readers receive Berlin . “Five years ago, in the face of climate change, the whole project had come to seem more and more irrelevant. People used to ask me who was going to care about a comic book about Germany. Now, though, it more and more relevant and I think that probably says something about the cycle of history. My initial choice was impulsive. It came from an unconscious desire to learn about that period and about the circumstances that led to war and the Holocaust; what I wanted to figure out was what essential aspects of human nature contribute to that kind of catastrophic event. “The racist aspects of American culture were apparent to me and it was clear that people with wealth and resources were holding all the power. I was living in Seattle, where the World Trade Organisation protests had happened, and there was already strong friction between the internet millionaires and the less fortunate. I was relating my experience in the moment to [what was going on in] my imagined Berlin, so I didn’t only think of the subject in a bubble to be looked at from a distance. All the same, I could never have predicted what would eventually come out of all of that.” The spectre of the president and his divisive policies can, he thinks, be felt, albeit in a loose way, in the book final chapter and a half, which he wrote after Trump was elected in “I wanted the book to be both tragic and hopeful at the end,” he says. “That came directly out of this moment and the fact that I have children. I live in rural Vermont so I am isolated from things to a degree. But they do feel dark. As someone who was at high school in the at the height of the cold war, when we had nightmares about the end of human civilisation, I’ve always lived with what you might call a sense of the impending apocalypse. But while I’m conscious of how bad things could go, I actively look for positives.” On the line from the US, his voice rises a few notes. “Yes, I cling to them. Cling is a good word.” Once his characters have finally left the page, their destinies now apparent, Lutes dispenses with panels, drawing instead a series of dramatic cityscapes. In the first, Berlin, bombed and broken, is on fire; smoke rises from its ruins as if from a funeral pyre. In the second, the city is divided; we see razor wire and the Wall. In the third, the Wall, now covered in graffiti, has a break in it; beyond it, cranes rise above the rooftops. Finally, there is a full-colour photograph – the rest of the book is in black and white – of Berlin as it is now, Potsdamer Platz gleaming in the sunshine. Only in the last image are any people to be seen. They are tiny as ants, but with their baby buggies and their rucksacks, their aspect nevertheless seems breezy. If any of them do see ghosts as they go about their day, you would certainly never know it. Berlin isn’t the only new comic to take on Germany and its wartime politics. This autumn also sees the publication of a graphic novel version of Anne Frank Diary adapted by Ari Folman and illustrated by David Polonsky, the Israeli pair best known for the Oscar-nominated film, Waltz With Bashir ; of the remarkable Heimat , a memoir by Nora Krug , a German-American illustrator who teaches at the Parsons School of Design in New York; and of The Three Escapes of Hannah Arendt , a biography of the German-born Jewish philosopher by Ken Krimstein , a Chicago academic whose cartoons have appeared in the New Yorker . Is this a coincidence or does it have a wider significance? Though he has not yet read the other books, Lutes believes it does. “It so interesting,” he tells me. “On some profound level, we are all connected to this deeper thing. We are all processing, consciously or subconsciously, our world and having tapped into something that in the air, our books have bloomed simultaneously.” I found great solace spending time with Hannah Arendt, this woman who was so reality-facing, so truth-telling Ken Krimstein It also reflects, he feels, the growing sophistication of comics. For the graphic novel, this is a golden age. Readers and publishers are vastly more receptive, writers and artists vastly more ambitious. Nothing is off-limits. “This is what I always hoped for as a teenager,” he says. The graphic adaptation of Anne Frank Diary was commissioned several years ago by the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel, Switzerland, in the hope that it would bring a new generation of possibly book-wary readers to her story; Folman , whose parents were Holocaust survivors, has spoken of his and Polonsky conviction that they should not treat the book as a sacred text and luckily the Fonds agreed with them (“Take the entry where she writes about Hans van Daan and his sausage making,” he says. “It might be [only] four sentences in the diary, but we make it a really fun part, a big thing, colourful and beautiful to look at.”). But the other books owe their existence entirely to the determination of their authors, who have made the seemingly impossible possible, something even they are wont to acknowledge when pressed. “What, you mean aside from the fact that I was hit on the head with a hard object?” jokes Krimstein when I ask what on earth made him believe he might be able to turn Arendt long life and highly complex philosophical thinking into a comic. Unlike Lutes and, to a lesser degree, Krug, he wrote his book quickly, starting in the summer of by which time Trump was the Republican presidential candidate (“and yes, I found great solace spending time with her, this woman who was so sensible, so reality-facing, so truth-telling”). For ages, though, he drew nothing at all, concentrating instead on how best to tell her story, which begins in the cobbled streets of Königsberg, when carriages were still drawn by horse, and ends on the Upper East Side of New York after the Ramones have started to gig (Arendt was born in in what was then still the German empire; she died in America in where, among other things, she was the first woman to be appointed a full professor at Princeton). In the end, he decided to divide his narrative into three, like a play. Each act would involve an escape: the first from the Gestapo in Berlin, after she was arrested in for researching antisemitism (Arendt and her mother fled by night over the mountains into Czechoslovakia, eventually making their way to Paris); the second from the French internment camp in Gurs to which she was sent in as an “enemy alien” in anticipation of the German invasion of France (in a period of confusion following France capitulation four weeks after her arrival, Arendt simply walked out of the camp; eventually, she made her way to Lisbon and then to the US); and the third from her former teacher, the philosopher Martin Heidegger, with whom she had been in love ever since she was a student and whom she had long been unable wholly to give up, even after he was compromised by appearing to support National Socialism. Krimstein next problem was getting Arendt to look right. “That took a while,” he says, when we meet in London (cartoonists seem to travel a lot these days; he is en route to the US from Germany via Ukraine). “She has a distinctive look, but I needed to draw it in such a way that it could be replicated again and again and easily aged. “Only a handful of photographs of her are extant, maybe I got to know them very well. Early in though, the Bibliotheque National in Paris found her library card from a new image, taken side-on. After that, I got it. The chin, the eyebrows; they became something.” He allowed himself to use only one colour in the book and that was green, which Arendt was known to wear and which also speaks of the earth, of life, of what she called natality (when acting together can create the unexpected). “That gave me a through line – that and the fact that she was a chain-smoker.” Krimstein book makes for a primer for Arendt ways of thinking and also for that of many of her friends and acquaintances (in homage to David Foster Wallace, The Three Escapes comes with copious footnotes on everyone from Walter Benjamin to Billy Wilder). But it is deeply concerned, too, with extremism and how attentive one should be to changes in the political atmosphere. “When she and her friends first heard about the camps in Germany, they were incredulous,” he says. “‘It doesn’t make any political sense,’ they said. But when the proof came, then she understood. Here was the abyss. “Those who say she minimised the crimes of the Nazis [in her book about the trial of Adolf Eichmann, in which she coined her now famous phrase “the banality of evil”], that she blamed the victims, were quite wrong.” The point is that the abyss opened up so relatively quickly and easily, a function of precisely the kind of unthinking nationalist zealotry that is now abroad, say, in Viktor Orbán Hungary. Krimstein believes we are at a liminal moment. It is almost years since the end of the war. Fewer and fewer people who lived through it are around to tell their story; soon, there will be no one left at all. “So then it becomes narrative and that is already opening up new ways of storytelling.” Comics are so inordinately nimble, capable both of great concision and formal inventiveness: “Art Spiegelman [author of Maus , the book that might be said to have made all other comic books about Hitler possible] said that comics are the art of turning time back into space and that is it, exactly. Certainly, that thought helped me a lot.” In Heimat , Krug turns time into space using not only cartoons and drawings but also documents, photographs and ephemera of all kinds. Her book, which takes its title from the German word meaning a sense of belonging that is strongly connected to place, is a memoir in which she seeks to discover what, exactly, her grandparents did in the war, a quest born both of her sense of “responsibility as a German who lives abroad” (it is years since she left the country where she was born) and of her own ignorance. “My generation had a rigorous war and Holocaust education,” she says. “It was good, and very important, but we learned [broad] facts, not what went on in our home towns. Most Germans of my generation know fairly little about what happened in their own families. Of course I was afraid. I worried the book would come across in the wrong way, as me trying to make excuses for the Germans, or trying to point out that they were victims, too. But I needed to tell it. I realised the war was so deeply buried in me.” Whatever you already know about Nazi Germany, it hard not to be horrified by Heimat , a narrative that reveals almost casually how easy it is to poison minds, how quickly the atmosphere of a country can change. On her father side, she traces the history of his brother, killed in the war at One day, she finds in an exercise book a story he wrote at school in aged in which he likens Jews to poisonous mushrooms (“Just like the poisonous mushroom can kill a whole family, the Jew can kill a whole people.”) For this, his teacher, having corrected three spelling mistakes, gave Franz-Karl a “B” for content. On her mother side, Krug discovers that Willi, her grandfather, was not the hero her family had made him out to be (a comforting myth had it that he hid his Jewish employer). Krug is appalled to discover that he joined the Nazi party (only of Germans did, membership having been closed by the leadership at a certain point); that he owned a copy of a photograph of a local Jewish lawyer being paraded before a crowd en route to a concentration camp. But every stage of her research brings with it a sense of all the horribly quotidian ways in which Nazism was experienced. Looking through some old phone books, she notices the first time Jewish citizens are listed separately and then, in the directory for that their names have disappeared altogether. Krug book, which took her six years to write, was published first in Germany, from where hate mail has already arrived. “Why should we continue to feel guilty?” her correspondents ask. She expected this but it doesn’t make it any easier. “I wish the book weren’t so relevant,” she says. “It very frightening, what happening.” Having traced the history of antisemitism in Külsheim, the town where her father was born, back to the century, she feels it is perfectly possible for history to repeat itself. “Antisemitism is an old sentiment in Europe . It disturbing to see the words favoured by the Nazis being used again: describing your political enemies as pigs, for instance.” Like Krimstein, she has a strong sense of this as a key moment. “People are dying. This is the time when we need to think about how we want future generations to learn about the Holocaust.” When Heimat begins, Krug has just arrived in New York from Berlin to study. She is standing on the rooftop of a friend apartment – the only person she then knew in the city – when an elderly woman who is sitting in a deckchair asks where she from. “I’m from Germany,” she says. They talk and the woman reveals that she survived a concentration camp because one of the female guards rescued her from the gas chamber times – perhaps because she had a crush on her (she was merciless towards everyone else). On hearing this, Krug feels a “familiar heat” in the pit of her stomach. What can she possibly say? A silence opens up between them. This story now has a postscript. A few weeks ago, on a whim, Krug typed these details – “camp, saved times” – into Google and, to her amazement, up came the name of this woman whose words she’d never been able to forget. She traced her phone number and, summoning all her courage, called her. “When I spoke to her, I burst into tears,” she tells me. “It felt so wonderful to speak to her. That moment on the roof... I was always going to make it the beginning of my book. It is a reminder that we don’t live in a historic vacuum, that we carry these pasts in us even when we haven’t lived through them ourselves.” And now, if I will forgive her, she must dash. Today, she and this survivor are to have lunch.

10,"as he, in the end, a musician or a poet? A grave philosopher or a grim sort of comedian? A cosmopolitan lady man or a profound, ascetic seeker? Jew or Buddhist? Hedonist or hermit? Across his years, the Montreal-born Leonard Cohen was all of these things – and in his posthumous book of poetry, given the Lawrentian title The Flame by his son Adam, all sides of the man are present. Other than that, Adam Cohen won’t say much more. “This was all private,” he says, sitting in an office on Los Angeles Wilshire Boulevard, near the house where his dad passed away after a late-night fall almost two years ago. “My father was very interested in preserving the magic of his process. And moreover, not demystifying it. Speaking of any of this,” he says, his voice dropping to a whisper, “is a transgression.” But after a few more remarks – stressing that Cohen wrote entirely in solitude, that he would consider discussion of his work a dangerous sort of “vanity” – Adam describes his late father, his sense of himself, and the heart of his achievement reasonably well. He’d call himself slow. He’d write poems about how Leonard Cohen was a lazy bastard living in a suit Adam Cohen “It all song, and it all poetry – for him there wasn’t any delineation,” he says of the decades of wrestling over the nature of his father gift. To Cohen himself, though, it was never enough. “He’d call himself slow,” Adam says. “He’d write poems about how Leonard Cohen was a lazy bastard living in a suit.” In fact, Cohen was a fierce perfectionist, devoted to an almost impossible level of rigour, and the bearer of what his son calls “a monastic discipline”. Adam nods toward a finished copy of the book: “This is what he was staying alive for.” Cohen had leukaemia, and dropped hints about his impending demise on You Want It Darker , his final album. (“I’m leaving the table / I’m out of the game,” he sings on one of its tracks.) “He was a man on a quest, on a mission,” Adam says, describing his father increasing sense of purpose and dedication in his last months, which included sending “do not disturb” emails to friends and family so he could finish the project. “That probably bought him some time on Earth.” Countless rock singers, from folkies to CBGBs punks, have been lazily dubbed “poetic” but Cohen was, by any measure, the real thing: he published no fewer than four books of verse, across a decade, before the release of his first LP, the mostly acoustic, finger-picked Songs of Leonard Cohen , which led off with the undeniably poetic “Suzanne”. (Oddly, he made early forays into music as a teenager, forming a country-folk band with friends called the Buckskin Boys, but he mostly let music drop until the release of his debut at age Those first poems emerged from a close-knit group of Canadian versifiers reading stanzas to each other in cafes and flats, printing mimeographed copies. “There were no prizes or grants or awards,” Cohen said in a radio interview. “There weren’t even any girls.” It seems appropriate that his last words – despite the power of You Want It Darker , released weeks before his death – would come in the form of a posthumous book of verse. As a young man, Cohen favourite poet was perhaps Federico García Lorca; he’d later name his daughter after the doomed Spaniard. But his sense of the art stretched back thousands of years and great writing would, he knew, outlive what he saw as his own meagre contributions. “He could recite to the letter,” Adam says. “Byron, Shakespeare, Rumi, the Bible … The guy was outrageously fluent.” Cohen once said his training, and sense of vocation, went back to Robert Burns, the French troubadours, Homer and King David. Adam calls his style “mytho-romantic,” which seems as good a term as any. Cohen was an exacting reader of the verse of others. In he sued his longtime business manager, a decade or so after she began taking his money. “He didn’t know where the accountant was cheating ,” Adam says. “But you could present him with a poem, and he could tell where the poet was cheating.” For Cohen, faking it was not an option: his own work, Adam says, “was a mandate from God”. In the same way it hard to imagine Cohen with even an untucked shirt – in later life he almost always appeared in full suit and tie, typically with brimmed hat and leather shoes – it difficult to conceive of an unfinished song, a number that would have been improved with an additional verse, or played in a different key. For his final publication, he left almost nothing to chance. Unlike, say, the mass of work, unfinished and otherwise, that often appears after a writer or musician dies – the endless songs and demos authorised by the Jimi Hendrix estate, for instance, or the obsessive mining of Tolkien Middle-earth – The Flame shows the emphasis Cohen put on distillation. “Nothing about this book,” Adam says, “is haphazard.” Reading the notebooks is a bittersweet experience: here are the seeds of Cohen songs we never got to hear Though Cohen came up during the beat era and admired Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, the cult of spontaneity never appealed to him. (“That never worked for me,” he said in “My first thoughts are dull, are prejudiced, are poisonous. I find last thought, best thought.”) The Flame is divided, as per Cohen instructions, into three sections, and organised by editors Robert Faggen and Alexandra Pleshoyano, scholars in California and Quebec respectively. The first is a selection of poems, some of which have been published before, going back several decades. Adam calls the first, “Happens to the Heart,” the “blueprint” of the entire collection. Most of it is in rhyme and metre; at least half could be described as light verse. The second section reprints the lyrics (sometimes differing from their recorded versions) from Cohen last three albums, plus “Blue Alert”, a recording by his former backing vocalist and romantic partner Anjani Thomas. (Cohen produced and wrote the lyrics.) On the page, the poise and polish of these songs remain striking. The third part is a selection from Cohen notebooks – distilled from more than pages across roughly years, up to and including, apparently, the day he died. A acceptance speech for a Spanish award serves as a brief coda. (There is also an email exchange with a friend; even his online correspondence seems to be in rhyme and metre.) Included in various proportions are love, sex, death, regret, exaltation, piety and gentle fondness. The blending of the earthy with the spiritual – in his last years Cohen was as influenced by a Hindu teacher as much as the Buddhist guru he studied with on a California mountain – would give John Donne and Marvin Gaye a run for their money. Throughout the book are sketches by Cohen, mostly self-portraits, with a few, unsurprisingly, of musical instruments and topless women. Even as the body failed, the flame of Cohen libido seemed to continue burning. While the notebooks are uneven, reading them makes for a bittersweet experience: it hard not to see these as the seeds of Cohen songs we never got to hear, finished poems we’ll never get to read. But Cohen never rushed his output, and could go almost a decade between albums. This wasn’t because ideas and images didn’t flow: he apparently filled notebooks every day of his life, and Adam describes finding them, as a child, in the poet desk drawers and jacket pockets, even, later, while seeking a bottle of tequila, coming upon a chilled, forgotten notebook in the freezer. This is an artist who worked on a single song – what would become “Hallelulah” – for several years, writing drafts and as many verses, only to have it rejected by his record label. (The final, much shorter, version became, after covers by John Cale and Jeff Buckley, Cohen most recorded song.) He wasn’t, then, one to dash things off. Despite the generous and world-weary humour that emerged in his last decades, – his early, folkie work was denounced as “humourless” –the task of writing was deadly serious. He surely knew the line from Yeats – a poet he deeply admired – about how “The intellect of man is forced to choose / Perfection of the life, or of the work.” On this wager, Cohen was unambiguous. “Religion, teachers, women, drugs, the road, fame, money,” Adam quotes his father saying; “nothing gets me high and offers relief from the suffering like blackening pages, writing.” It was also, he writes in his foreword, “a statement of regret”, since Cohen sacrificed so much – he never married, considered himself a poor father, let his health and financial state decline – for the Muse. Amidst numerous liaisons and botched relationships, poetry is the one thing he remained entirely faithful to. The Flame is the incontrovertible proof.

11,"Consider all the small anxieties that pepper your average day, to leave you quietly irritated or uncomfortable. They might be so ordinary that you barely realise you’re bothered; perhaps a manspreader on your commute, a person who walked into you while gazing at their phone, the coffee queue jumper. New Yorker cartoonist Liana Finck calls these “micro-unkindnesses – the tiny permutations of rudeness that people perform on one another”. From afar (lurking on her Instagram), it is easy to identify Finck main bugbears: the strange distribution of seats in her local cafe in New York, boorish people blundering into her personal space, slow walkers. But it this eye for small annoyances that makes her so popular. She may feel that her constant existential terror makes her a bit weird, but it seems there are enough like-minded souls out there to make her quite normal. (Her followers on Instagram are devout enough that her biography states: “You may tattoo.”) “All my weirdness around people is just weirdness about myself. I’ve always been self-conscious and shy, but I wonder if that can be your whole life. I might get used to all the things in the world and stop being anxious about them,” she says. She doesn’t sound very sure. Finck style reflects her anxieties: her humans are spindly scribbles with childlike faces that are sometimes little more than a chin, or two bulging eyes. Yet, it is anything but simple; she can reproduce a complex emotional state in just a squiggle – a talent she credits to her synaesthesia. One might think that supernatural levels of confidence must be required to draw as she does, where nothing can be hidden by beauty. “Thank you,” she says, gravely. “I fake it. My dream is to think while I work. I don’t know if that will ever happen.” Finck loves observing human behaviour, whether it is through advice columns (she addresses strangers’ romantic woes, anxiety problems and zipper issues in her own, the New Yorker Dear Pepper ), talk radio or simply watching passers-by. But her latest book, Passing for Human is all about people she knows most intimately: herself and her family. Set around a family story – that women are born with a shadow, a literal embodiment of their true self – Passing for Human is a bildungsroman of sorts, laying out all the decisive moments that have made Finck who she is now. Her shadow, a looming figure that watched over her early life, simultaneously inspiring and holding her back, is Finck explanation for the strange scrap of a girl she once was: one who talked to rocks and plants because she “saw the souls of objects”, made an imaginary friend and struggled with communication. (She took to barking at adults, after “learning” from her dog, Pepper). Then, at the age of she began deliberately adopting what she considered normal behaviour, changed her clothes, developed an eating disorder – and, finally, made friends. But lost the shadow. Finck talks about her shadow matter-of-factly – as if it was a literal friend who left her life: “It is not the self, but the judgment that helps you know yourself. It walks behind you, knows you better than you know yourself and guides you to what is right for you. My shadow was a burden, it made me weird, shy and awkward. But it also taught me to draw, so it not all bad.” Passing for Human is also a creation myth, about creation: entire worlds, babies, houses, childhood stories – even the book itself, with the narrative constantly restarting as Finck reattempts to explain herself. Finck is Jewish, and links her architect mother construction of their childhood home with God efforts designing the Garden of Eden. (Finck God is also a woman, quietly moulding a paradise from clay.) Her family faith sits uneasily on her: she reads the Torah and loves Hebrew, but she feels an outsider in her parents’ orthodox community. “Plus there are so many Jewish holidays, it too much. With all the get-togethers, you feel like you’re in an Edith Wharton novel,” she groans. Finck has a noticeable flair for phrases that are simultaneously odd and precise: her high school was too “tight-sweatpantsy” for her, while her father is “very smart, but in a presidential-biography way”. Yet she still struggles with communication. She likens her feelings during any regular conversation to the rising panic a tourist might feel in a foreign country – trapped in her own mind, scurrying about for the perfect words to “appease” whoever she talking to. Passing for Human by Liana Finck – review Drawing was the perfect communication method, then – until it wasn’t. Countless artists and writers talk of learning by copying; for Finck, her favourites became a burden: “When I started as a cartoonist at the end of college, I was trying too hard. I thought I couldn’t be a true artist unless I was Daniel Clowes, Haruki Murakami or Saul Steinberg. I was just a stuffier version of them.” Everything that emerged from her time at Cooper Union college in New York was “overworked”, too deliberate compared to her childhood efforts: “I think I was a real artist until I turned I was a perfectionist, but I wasn’t trying to be professional.” These days Finck only works with a single black pen, a sign to herself that she has relaxed somewhat. For she has found her people through the New Yorker, braved publishing an exposing memoir and has learned, as she puts it, “to turn myself outward. That never came naturally to me.” She may be the only person on Earth that has had her anxieties – about being alone, about being misunderstood – soothed rather than exacerbated by social media. “I am already starting to feel like I have exorcised those demons through Instagram. I don’t feel like writing about them any more,” she says. “It a bit sad!” Passing for Human is published by Penguin Random House .",1000,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/27/i-was-a-real-artist-until-i-turned-11-the-anxieties-of-new-yorker-cartoonist-liana-finck
12,"Sapiens author Yuval Noah Harari has warned Donald Trump that global cooperation is crucial if humanity is to face its “existential crisis”, after the US president publicly rejected the approach at the UN this week . The Israeli academic, whose books about the past and future of humanity, Sapiens and Homo Deus, have sold in their millions, said Trump speech embracing “the doctrine of patriotism” was very disturbing. Speaking on Thursday, Harari said that humankind faced an existential crisis due to three overlapping problems: nuclear war, climate change and technological disruption. “All these problems are global problems in essence, and it should be clear to everybody – especially to politicians – that there is no national solution to nuclear war, climate change or technological disruption,” Harari said. “You can’t build a wall against nuclear winter or against global warming and you can’t regulate artificial intelligence or biotechnology on a national basis. Because nobody would like to be behind, nobody would like to limit their own research and development if other countries are not adopting similar regulations. Global cooperation is the first and necessary step to successfully facing our challenges as a species.” Harari also took a dim view of Brexit, which he described as “basically a distraction. I don’t think inherently it a bad idea … but the timing is terrible… If the EU breaks up into different countries, it going to be much more difficult to negotiate climate agreements, to have a common front against the hi-tech giants. Every minute the UK and EU institutes are spending on Brexit is a minute they don’t spend on climate change. And they spend a lot of minutes on it. [Brexit] is just a fantasy about being independent ... there are no longer any independent countries in the world “Also it all just a fantasy about being independent. But there are no longer any independent countries in the world. It doesn’t matter what written on some document.” According to Harari, technological disruption – through the rise of artificial intelligence, biotechnology and surveillance programmes – is a threat to freedom, due to the use of personal data by corporations and governments. “That a very big danger,” said Harari, who does not own a smartphone and was meeting press in London to promote his new book about the dangers of accelerating technological development, Lessons for the Century. “If we reach a point when governments have the ability to press people emotional buttons in a very efficient way, then elections don’t mean anything anymore. And we are quite close to that point.” Regulation of future technology should be a top political priority, he said, because some countries are likely to adopt it to control their populations: “If we don’t want this to happen we need to think about it now, not in or years, because that will be too late.” The author found room for hope, however, praising “the amazing peacefulness” of Brexit negotiations. “In previous centuries a question like this could only have been decided by a major war with millions of people being displaced or injured and as far as I know only one person lost her life,” he said, a reference to the murder of MP Jo Cox. “It amazing that you just vote about it and accept it, whichever way it would have gone.” “For the last few decades, humankind has enjoyed the most peaceful era in history. I don’t think the new challenges are impossible. It depends on what we decide to do.” This article was amended on September to correct a misquote: Harari called Brexit a “distraction”, not a “destruction”.",601,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/27/yuval-noah-harari-trump-patriotism-global-threats-sapiens
13,"This month on the reading group, we want to celebrate the Windrush generation. This was a reader suggestion – and it a fine one. Now is a very good time to acknowledge the debt we owe to this essential part of UK community, and the many fine things the Caribbean diaspora has brought the world, enriching both literary culture and our daily lives. It possible to argue that UK publishing has been benefiting from Caribbean talent for more than years. Even before the Empire Windrush steamed over here in writers from the islands were making their lives here. One of the first to be published was Jean Rhys, the daughter of a family with rapidly diminishing fortunes who set sail from Dominica in She best known for her writings in Paris in the but she actually spent just as much time in London. Not, it should be noted, that she enjoyed being in the city, describing it as “a cold dark dream”. Like so many who came after her, Rhys suffered from poverty, snobbery and mistreatment in a society distrustful of her heavily accented English. But she also published superb books like Good Morning, Midnight, Voyage in the Dark – and, of course, years later, the crowning glory, Wide Sargasso Sea . Trinidadian CLR James was the next unforgettable name to arrive in the UK. He first visited in and soon became the first black Caribbean author to publish a novel here, when the groundbreaking Minty Alley came out in . Alongside numerous books about culture and leftwing politics, James also went on to publish Beyond a Boundary in This pioneering blend of sport, memoir and serious politics is another stone-cold classic. It remains one of the best books you could hope to read about cricket – not to mention an essential account of West Indian culture and a magnificently eloquent challenge to colonialism. Then came James Berry, one of the first writers to come to Britain after Windrush docked in Tilbury and a Jamaican poet who started writing in a mixture of standard English and Jamaican patois. In turn, Berry helped inspire writers like Samuel Selvon, author of The Lonely Londoners , which made extensive use of Trinidadian English for narrative as well as dialogue – and was partly inspired by (and what could be more London?) a bus ride. “I sat like a passenger,” said Selvon, “and let the language do the writing.” The result was electric – a book that has never since gone out of print and inspired dozens more by writers such as George Lamming, Andrew Salkey, Stuart Hall, Wilson Harris, Edgar Mettleholzer and Edward Brathwaite. In Braithwaite said that within years of the publication of The Lonely Londoners “nearly every West Indian novelist worth the name had come to London”. It was an amazing flourishing of talent – although, less happily, Braithwaite also noted that the British public knew next to nothing about these books. He would later help set up the Caribbean Artists Movement , an initiative to help those writers (and actors, poets and musicians) receive the recognition they deserved. This month reading group should be an excellent opportunity to acknowledge that talent – but I’m also keen not to restrict things to first generation immigrants. Before we get to the nominations stage, one more thing. This is also an opportunity to commemorate VS Naipaul, who said of arriving in London: “It had become the centre of my world and I had worked hard to come to it. And I was lost.” Lost or not, he wrote novels while living in the city that would help earn him the Nobel prize. Whatever you make of him personally , his novels certainly deserve a place in the hat. Talking of that hat, I’ll gather all your suggestions later this week and make an announcement when I draw out the winner. So please get your nomination in by commenting below: we welcome all suggestions of books by and about the Windrush generation, their descendants and the wider Caribbean diaspora. Here a useful set of names if you’re looking for inspiration – that an awful lot of talent to choose from.",696,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/oct/02/reading-group-what-should-we-read-to-celebrate-the-windrush-generation
14,"The Quiet Snow The quiet snow Will splotch Each in the row of cedars With a fine And patient hand; Numb the harshness, Tangle of that swamp. It does not say, The sun Does these things another way. Even on hats of walkers, The air of noise And street-car ledges It does not know There should be hurry. The Canadian poet John Raymond Knister was born in in Ruscomb, Ontario. He began publishing short stories and reviews in and moved to Iowa City in where he became associate literary editor of the Midland , a flourishing little magazine. Knister had ambitious aims for Canadian literature. Reading this biographical note , I was reminded of Edwin Morgan more recent project to develop Scottish poetic identity through contact with the wider currents of modernism. Knister was concerned with Canadian writing in a similar way, and his own work contains a subtle fusion of the different energy sources, national and modernist. The Quiet Snow is interesting no less for its layering of different styles than its presentation of contrasting “pictures”. Fourteen lines do not a sonnet make, of course, but there are other traditional echoes: the unconventional “turn”, revised as a scene-shift between the two stanzas, is one of them. This shift from rural to urban space might be following Knister real-life itinerary to from Canadian farmlands to US city. It doesn’t change the argument of the poem, but radically alters the scenery. We begin with a pastoral in which order and wilderness are interestingly combined. The informal verb “splotch”, applied to the action of the snow, suggests the latter might be an abstract artist of the natural world. But this artist is also praised for “a fine / And patient hand”. There is orderliness in the “row of cedars” itself, and contrasting wilderness in “tangle of that swamp”. The latter image follows an abstraction that Knister ideally might have avoided, “numb the harshness”. But if “numb” seems slightly misjudged, “harshness” is swiftly and effectively translated by the unruly “tangle” and “swamp”. It as if the poet had decided to have the best of two poetic worlds, the romantic and the imagist, the “telling” and the “showing.” The rhymes he allows to sneak into this stanza (“row”/“snow” and more emphatically, “say”/”way”) have a similar effect, that of a quick, backward glance at tradition. But now we’re in a different scenario, with a surprise of pedestrians’ hats, “street-car ledges” and the “air of noise”. The latter is an oddly effective phrase. It seems to gather the diverse, continuous sounds of the city into a wind-like roar. (Could the city in question be Chicago, where Knister apparently drove taxis for a time?) The image is also visual, like a sort of snow-dappled fog. After the nine lines of the “rural” stanza, the compression of these “city” lines to five enhances the sense of overcrowding but, thanks to the strange, synaesthetic amalgam of air, noise and leisurely snow, without losing the impression of surrounding space. Despite the jocular bathos in the appearance of those hats, the underlying concept of the poem is romantic: the snow, representing unhurried nature, challenges and corrects the time-harried city, its pedestrians and traffic. At the same time, the message is muted, and the tone ironically amused rather than stern. The snow is an apparently conscious agent, and, in the second stanza, quizzically, “It does not know / there should be hurry.” Imagism may have been abandoned, but so, too, has the voice of the poet as moralist. The snow itself is the exemplar of quiet country habits and traditional virtues. Knister contributed to a number of genres besides poetry: as well as his work as an editor, he wrote fiction and criticism. He died prematurely in in a drowning accident, but young though he was, he had made a vibrant contribution to the literature of his country, and to poetry in English. His work is essential reading for anyone interested in those still-unfinished narratives.",663,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/oct/01/poem-of-the-week-the-quiet-snow-by-raymond-knister
15,"Welcome to this week blog. Here our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. “Please recommend me some classics, TLS,” said , who also offered “bonus points” for “excellent classics by female authors”. Here just a small selection of the excellent suggestions that came in, starting with SydneyH : That depends on your definition of “classic” - if you mean Greek or Roman, you won’t find too many women. I often recommend as entry points for people who don’t read classics things like Treasure Island, and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea - books which are wonderful works of popular escapism, which challenge any sort of stuffy notion of what a classic is supposed to be. But I support every recommendation of Great Expectations. If you want texts by women, Wise Blood by Flannery O’Connor is a really great start. Goodyorkshirelass recommended Elizabeth Gaskell Cranford: A short novel. I first read it some years ago, before the TV adaptation. I was beguiled by the freshness of it, almost as if it had been written yesterday. went for Ann Radcliffe The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Sicilian Romance: Both superb examples of the Gothic novel. I’ll recommend them to anyone looking for something thrilling and haunting. ChronicExpat took us further afield: If you’re at all interested in the world beyond ‘the West’, and you’re up for a bit of a challenge, try The Tale of Gengi by the century Japanese noblewoman, Lady Murasaki Shikibu. It is often credited as the world first novel; if not the first, it is certainly one of the very earliest. Translations matter here: go for the Edward Seidensticker translation which is faithful to the original; and other-worldly in the beauty of its imagery. If you open your heart and mind to it, Gengi will change your life. Swelter went back to fundamentals: I should add that I found Classical Literature: An Epic Journey from Homer to Virgil and Beyond by Richard Jenkyns a useful overview - I believe it published in the UK as a Pelican Introduction to Classical Literature. It is indeed a Pelican – and it excellent. Elsewhere, paulburns has finished Kate Atkinson Transcription: It is a tense suspenseful spy novel from beginning to end, replete with Atkinson delightful sense of Englishness and her rich, very dark humour … As one expects of Atkinson, her attention to historical detail is impeccable, but lightly portrayed. Captain_Flint has enjoyed John Fowles The French Lieutenant Woman: A nice piece of prose emulating the Victorian novel to a fault, with its quirky vocabulary and stilted turn of phrase, but encased in a postmodern narrative frame. The plot device commonly known as authorial intrusion, which writers developed into a recognisable hallmark fixture in fiction, is here used to such an extent the narrator himself becomes a character in the novel. And he not there just to tell the story and reveal the characters’ innermost thoughts; his purpose is first and foremost to challenge the Victorian literary tropes that helped establish the modern popular view on Britain by frequently alluding to historically informed data based on sources other than fictional accounts... I very much enjoyed this novel, and the clever contrivance that turned The French Lieutenant Woman into a bestseller in the and the fact of putting forward three different endings, still retains considerable charm Finally, provides a fascinating report from crime writing festival Bloody Scotland: Mick Herron has been my first choice since I returned. I think he is a brilliant writer. Not just a brilliant crime writer. On this theme, on several of the panel talks I attended, sly and wry comments were made by some of the crime writers on “literary” fiction, notably the sentences that seemed to pass muster because they are deemed “poetic”, the fact that some literary writers wouldn’t know what a plot was if it fell into their soup. I am using my own language here, not theirs but basically, the point was how much bad writing gets praised and overhyped because it is “literary” and often is in fact not particularly good writing. And before anyone says it, yes, I know, much crime writing can be poor and formulaic - just like so-called literary fiction. Intriguing. Which writers are overhyped, I wonder? Interesting links about books and reading An article for when you want to know about the second person in literature. A round table of New York Times critics discuss the Nobel Prize. “What did Doris Lessing mean when she called Anna and Molly in The Golden Notebook “free women”?” Madeleine Schwartz explains . “The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re: fiction.” Flannery O’Connor knew a thing or two about reading.

16,"ne quiet weeknight in June, my phone buzzed. Pause, then another alert. A steady stream of notifications swept in over the evening. What on earth was going on? Just moments earlier, I had tweeted a request for reading tips. The goal: to make my way through books written by women from every country in the world. Recommendations were flying in thick and fast. My new bookshelf would be piled high in no time! My debit card quivered. The following days saw a global span of readers, authors and translators nudge me towards women writers from Cameroon, El Salvador, Lebanon, Mauritius … I gathered all of them into a blog and set off on my biblio-travels. And it been quite the journey. My starting point – a realisation that anglocentric and male-dominated reading habits were blinkering my worldview – feels a long way back. Sure, the publishing industry gender bias is old news, but I was shocked to learn that male authors dominate more than two-thirds of the translated fiction market. Meytal Radzinski, founder of Women in Translation month, recently exposed the solid foundations of this status quo: over five years, we’ve seen no change to the proportion of translated fiction written by women authors – just is the rule. Now think about that figure in the context of translated works squeezing into only of the UK fiction sector. Yet you don’t have to look far to find plenty of excellent translated fiction by women. Just this summer, I have visited every continent – including Antarctica, thanks to Alicia Kopf sparkling Brother in Ice , translated by Mara Faye Lethem. Some days I’ve been immersed in stories by young debut writers, other days in stories by garlanded literary stars born more than a century ago yet who are often only newly out in English. I try to steer away from higher-profile authors, for instance, swapping Italy Elena Ferrante for the acclaimed but lesser-known Elsa Morante . Three months in, I’m through and on track to finish my lap of the world in That may sound a long way off, but I want to avoid rushing and be realistic about reading books alongside full-time work and a social life. Will I struggle to commit for the long run? Absolutely not. I’ve staved off any potential non-fiction withdrawal symptoms with the occasional long read online, and am getting by with reading reviews and interviews with British authors whose books I’m missing in the meantime. It has also proved to me how ridiculous the phrase “women writing” is. The books I’ve read have been wildly, delightfully different in both style and substance, zigzagging from a surreal Chinese short-story collection to a Mexican gothic novella to an epic Polish “constellation novel” and so on. My favourite so far? Disoriental by the Iranian author Négar Djavadi (translated by Tina Kover), a mesmeric debut novel in which a daughter of Iranian dissidents records her family history from a Paris fertility clinic waiting room. These months have also exposed my own prejudices. Several pages into The Iliac Crest by Cristina Rivera Garza (translated by Sarah Booker), I realised with surprise that the narrator was male. Why hadn’t I expected a woman could write from a man perspective? The reverse happens inexhaustibly. I grew up in south Wales during the era of Cool Cymru , and if there one thing I learned in Welsh class it that we shouldn’t accept a one-dimensionally English curriculum. Gloomy publishing stats aside, I see reasons to be cheerful about reading habits veering in favour of translated fiction, which accounts for up to of all UK fiction sales. On a recent episode of my podcast series bookSHElf, translator Jennifer Croft (who won this year Man Booker International prize for her translation of Olga Tokarczuk Flights) revealed her optimism about attitudes changing. “I’ve been really amazed lately,” Jennifer told me. “As much as I believe in the power of this novel, I never thought it would have made such a huge splash in the US.” Are you keen to read more women?

17,"’m aware of the consequences for women who go off-script. When I published a book earlier this year – six personal essays about all the things we’re not meant to say – I was fearful of the public response, afraid of being labelled disruptive. And I have been – but mostly in a good way. Every day I get emails from readers thanking me for talking about alcoholism, infertility and sexual violence. One of the few negative reactions came from a radio journalist, who questioned how –not why – I’d chosen to write about having been raped when I was Why hadn’t I put the description of the rape at the beginning of the book, he asked, to “hit people between the eyes”? I was taken aback by his question, and after the interview I found I couldn’t let it go. Why had he asked me that? And why had he asked me live on air? His question suggested that the only reason I could possibly have to describe being raped was so I could use it as a weapon. All the emotions I had – fury, sadness, regret and fear – were reduced to one: anger. It as if there a new script: the angry woman script. And I’m not sure that I like this one, either. When I was I read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Like every girl who wants to be a writer, I idolised Jo. Rereading it recently, I re-encountered so many things I’d loved, from Jo exuberant character to her ability to make an independent living from writing. But I stumbled when I came to these words from Marmee: “I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo; but I have learned not to show it … I’ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips; and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked.” Marmee advice to Jo is: repress your anger, because the cause is not the problem – it you. When I was asked by that interviewer to justify how I had written about being raped, I was not angry. I so wanted to be likable that I only said it was “my life and my story” and left it at that. Did I check myself because as a child I had internalised Marmee advice? Should I have reacted with fury? As we find ourselves in the age of #MeToo, when women anger – so long seen as a problem – has been rebranded as a solution, do all women have a duty to be a little bit angry, all the time? This moment seems to demand our individual and collective fury – as Rebecca Traister puts it, “the anger window is open”. Yet it complicated, this anger. I find myself dwelling on it, reflecting on its sudden scale, wondering how long the window will be open, whether there a right kind of anger, or a right way to express it. And I wonder, too, how I can write and speak into this window without throwing myself out of it. Where once women emotional labour was invested in suppressing anger, now we work to display our pain for a public gaze Perhaps I need a more up-to-date literary model than the dutiful Jo, who tries to please her mother by quietening her temper. So I looked to my bookshelves to consider how anger pays off for women in novels. So often, they feature women who get angry – strong and inspiring, exasperating and joyfully disobedient women. But these women also get punished for their anger. From Nora in Claire Messud The Woman Upstairs, whose first lines seem to promise a brilliant explosion of anger (“How angry am I? You don’t want to know”), but who foments only her own pain; to Lila in Elena Ferrante Neapolitan novels, repeatedly punished for her passionate self-direction by poverty, violence and the loss of a child – it seems the trajectory of anger brings only negative consequences. This is a paradox that I struggle to reconcile – that the fictional characters we love because they dare to say or do the things we won’t are also made to bear the harshest penalties. The forms of anger may vary – from the global feminist uprising in Naomi Alderman The Power to the quiet, private fury of Elizabeth Strout Olive Kitteridge – but punishment remains consistent. Though these are electrifying characters to read, the dividends of their words and actions are, at best, alienation and loneliness. At worst, it is rape and death. Even when a narrative is reimagined for the social media generation – as in Kamila Shamsie reworking of the Antigone myth in Home Fire – the heroine still dies at the end. I wonder why female characters still seem fated to plot lines that compel their punishment and death. Have we really not moved on from Antigone, or Hedda Gabler, or The Awakening? My disappointment that the subversive power of women anger does not result in utopian finales is not because I hold women writers to an unreasonable or impossible standard. My dismay is that their diagnoses seem so cuttingly accurate. For it not only on the page that women are punished for their anger – these novels are mirrors to the trolling and abuse we see in life and online every day. Does society have to transform before these plots do? Do novels lead change, or only reflect it in hindsight? Rage is beginning to feel like a permanent state of being. The cultural turn towards listening to women anger is, obviously, a good thing. But there are times when it feels as if being vocally angry has become a requirement, rather than an option. Where once women emotional labour was invested in suppressing anger, now we work to display our pain for a public gaze that is often unsympathetic. Think of all the hashtags: #MeToo, #TimesUp, #WhyIStayed or #WhyIDidn’tReport. A lot is being asked of women – not only that they identify and labour to fix the problems of gender inequality, but also that they absorb the emotional and social consequences of protest. Protest is necessary. But it is also exhausting. ‘I broke the contract’: how Hannah Gadsby trauma transformed comedy I thought about all these questions as I watched Hannah Gadsby standup show Nanette , a call to action to angry women. Gadsby reveals the damage done by the self-deprecating scripts gay women are forced into by our homophobic culture. She demands that the narrative changes – both her own, and ours – to accommodate her fury. But then, in the show final moments, Gadsby declares that she is wary of anger. Anger, she says, is a way to unite people, but ultimately it only serves to spread “blind hate”. It a double bind. We need anger to call out inequality and violence, we need anger to provoke a reaction, and we need anger to drive us towards change. But anger will scar and consume us. It a salutary warning. Gadsby invocation to tell our stories, but to resist anger, is worlds away from Marmee advice to Jo. No longer are women expected to shake themselves; instead, we are being asked to shake the world. But giving permission to women to be angry does not mean that we have divested ourselves entirely of attitudes to women and power. When I am told that I am “brave” for writing about all the things I shouldn’t say, I want to say: “I’m not brave – I’m angry.” Too often, though, I say nothing – because I know the risks of being labelled angry, and because, like Gadsby, and perhaps a little like Marmee too, I am distrustful of the restless energies of anger. And I am distrustful, too, of the way that a woman expressing a strong opinion, or being honest about painful experiences, is now identified only with anger, rather than any other emotional or intellectual capacity. And so, while I relish reading angry women on the page and am grateful for those angry women leading campaigns against inequality and violence, most of all I hope for something else. I hope that this moment is about much more than anger. I hope that we can create a permanent space for women to be more than just one thing at a time. We have so many stories to tell. Let go off the script entirely. Notes to Self: Essays by Emilie Pine is published by Tramp Press.

18,"The book I’m currently reading As always, I have submissions to read (I work in publishing). When I’m allowed to read for pleasure, it usually non-fiction – or something ancient and Greek. The book that changed my life I was brought up within earshot of north-east Scottish dialect, folklore and music, in what remained of a fishing community with its oral tradition, superstitions and legends. Tending to the solitary, I fell naturally towards books and read indiscriminately. The stories I remember were Scottish folk tales, the Greek myths (in some hopelessly expurgated edition, upgraded slowly through the years) and Grimm. As a teenager I found Mervyn Peake Titus books intoxicating, and those novels, probably, started my passion for fiction, while Yeats and Hughes and Heaney were making poetry crucial to me. I’m not sure a book has changed my life, but all great art jolts your perspective and enlarges your gaze. The book I wish I’d written I suppose I’m always trying to write that book (which is the only way to pay attention, the only way to improve). To have produced books of the stature of James Joyce Ulysses , or Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry, or David Jones In Parenthesis , without the attendant physical or psychological damage – that would be an achievement. The book that influenced my writing The work of David Jones – not just the poetry and essays, but the engravings, drawings, watercolours and, particularly, the painted inscriptions. I hope my admiration for his writing doesn’t stray into mimicry. The world of poetry is small and currently polarised: it often either simplistic or incomprehensible The book that is most underrated There are great books that fail to be recognised at the time but are rediscovered, like John Williams Stoner , or novels like Ulverton or Death and Nightingales that offer a constant admonitory warning to judges of literary prizes. I wish more people read Jane Bowles: Two Serious Ladies and Plain Pleasures are wonderful. The last book that made me laugh The books that make me laugh, cry, then smash furniture tend to be written by people driven by self-promotion and shallow narcissism; they don’t have time to bother with all that pesky learning-the-craft business: they want “Likes” on social media and they’re having strong and important feelings somewhere near you, right now. The world of poetry is small and currently polarised: it often either simplistic or incomprehensible. I find myself in the middle, vaguely appalled. I’m allergic to “light verse”, because it seems a betrayal of the purpose of poetry. Equally, poetry that sets out to be deliberately opaque is betraying the purpose of language. The book I couldn’t finish I spend my life not finishing books – though they’re mostly manuscripts rather than books. The book I’m ashamed not to have read Being Scottish, I carry enough shame already without needing the help of books. My earliest reading memory I remember sitting in the congregation of King College chapel in Aberdeen, transfixed by my father sermon. I was never a believer, but the power and beauty of his delivery was thrilling. It was the cadences rather than the creed that moved me, and I understood then how language could be made to sing. The book I give as a gift I almost never give books as presents: it feels rather presumptuous, or something ... My comfort read I feel I’m drifting towards a fondness for biographies, where one can find comfort in seeing people make a mess of their lives and the lives of others and still produce art that is beautiful and lasting.

19,"n the digital age, time is precious. Many technological innovations, from faster broadband to instant messaging, promise to make our lives easier and more efficient, saving time for the good stuff. Yet many of us feel more harried than ever. We vacillate between blaming technology for our time pressure and turning to it for the solution. Our fixation with optimising time recalls The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, whose eponymous hero arrives on Earth to find a merchant selling sophisticated pills intended to quench one thirst: take one each week and the need to drink disappears. “Why are you selling those?” the little prince asks. “Because it saves a lot of time,” replies the merchant. “Experts have worked it all out. You save minutes a week.” “If I had minutes to spend,” says the prince, “I would walk very slowly towards a spring of fresh water.” Clearly, the desire to save time isn’t new. A long-standing theme in social theory has been the sense that the pace of everyday life is accelerating. As early as in The Philosophy of Money , Georg Simmel describes how the speed of the modern metropolis gives rise to a new temporality. For him, the acceleration of city life is intricately bound up with the velocity of the circulation of money. His analysis of modern time-consciousness, as one involving immediacy, simultaneity and presentism, speaks directly to our own sense of living at a rapid pace. The question should not always be how do we save time, but what do we want to save time for? In Social Acceleration , Hartmut Rosa shows how constant connectivity – in a culture that prioritises hyper-productivity, speed and efficiency – does not save time. Just as creating more roads produces more traffic, so answering emails generates endless email traffic. The Silicon Valley gurus who designed these technologies then, without irony, seek temporal refuge by embracing mindfulness, via a new range of marketable apps. Or they go off the grid for the weekend: their Californian libertarian dreams now turnturn the wheels of today turbo capitalism. Tim Wu The Attention Merchants reveals how the campaign to capture and monetise our attention has shaped advertising. There is no precedent for how much time we now spend staring at screens, whether at work, leisure or for everything in between. Wu is right to focus on design: the expertise of the world best psychologists is being harnessed to keep us online. No wonder we find these platforms addictive – they are meant to be. Over the last decade, even economists have recognised that downtime is a significant measure of life satisfaction and wellbeing. As the political philosopher Julie Rose argues in Free Time , discretionary spare time is a basic resource – an all-purpose means to pursue one conception of the good, whatever it may be. And if the ability to choose how you allocate your time lies at the core of a positive notion of freedom, then it follows that a just society must guarantee all citizens their fair share of free time. Rather than read the plethora of self-help guides to time management, it is perhaps more advantageous to understand the pressure to maximise time. Saving time should not be venerated as an end in itself, nor taken as the divine doctrine of technological progress. Instead, as we learn from the little prince, the question should not always be how do we save time, but what do we want to save time for? &nbsp; Pressed for Time: The Acceleration of Life in Digital Capitalism by Judy Wajcman is published by Chicago.",600,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/01/books-to-understand-pace-of-life-further-reading

22,"t is years exactly since Matilda, Roald Dahl novel about a brave little girl who loves books and hates bullies, was first published. To celebrate this anniversary, eight new illustrations of Matilda by Dahl longtime illustrator Quentin Blake are revealed for the first time. Blake was only asked by Matilda current publishers, Puffin, to create one sketch, showing what she would be up to as a Instead, the decided to create eight, three of which appear on the covers of the anniversary editions. “I have had a lot of fun imagining what that little girl might be doing now she all grown up,” Blake writes in a new foreword. “Since, as a small child, Matilda was gifted in several different ways, it wasn’t very difficult.” To celebrate her birthday, we asked six children authors to imagine what Matilda would be doing at – and asked how her childhood would have influenced her character and behaviour as an adult. Michael Rosen : ‘She’d be a standup comedian – and do an incredible impression of Miss Trunchbull’ I think Matilda at would be a very successful standup comedian. Comedians are quite vulnerable people, in my experience, and I think Matilda would have been scarred by her parents. Though she had saved herself, it would have made her very raw. If you got too close, she might tongue-lash you a little bit. Comedy would help relieve her of the hurt her parents inflicted on her, a way to kind of love them. She knows Virginia Woolf off by heart and draws on this whole hinterland of literature during her act. She shows her own fallibilities and hopes on stage, which is something I think good comedians are really good at doing. She would do an incredible impression of Miss Trunchbull but also of Miss Honey, whom she’d present as too good to be good: “What the point of that?” she’d ask the audience. She go off into a whole riff about her telekinesis: “Oh by the way, when I was a kid I could make a water jug move.” She would talk about it in a way that would leave you not knowing what was real and finish with: “And then a teacher threw one of the kids out of the window.” And you would half-believe her. Tragically, Miss Honey is dead. She fell off the side of a boat in a fjord in Norway while looking for Roald Dahl , when Matilda was in her So now there is an inner sadness in Matilda, which she hides. Doing comedy helps her keep her feelings of sadness at bay. Michael Rosen latest book Reading and Rebellion: An Anthology of Radical Writing for Children is out now. Francesca Simon : ‘She would not be an explorer or a scientist. She’d have a job around books’ When I think of Matilda, I think of books. Books are the main part of her life and make her life worthwhile. And although she brave and comfortable in her own skin, she introverted. She a person who likes to sit in an armchair and read. So there no doubt in my mind that, at she would not be an explorer or a scientist. She’d have a job around books – maybe running a bookshop, working as a children librarian or, at a stretch, being an education minister. As an adult, she would have a great capacity for happiness because she has survived situations that would crush most children. She still an extraordinarily fast reader and by now, she will have read everything. Sharing books is what gives her joy. She continues to be strong-minded but she probably quite shy, one of those quiet people who is a really good listener. I can also see her being a passionate advocate for libraries and spearheading a campaign to ensure that every school has a library. She would force herself to come out of her quietness to do that. The opera based on Francesca Simon book The Monstrous Child opens at the Royal Opera House in February Ed Vere: ‘She would have been prime minister for a couple of years at least by now’ Matilda was precocious so I think at the young age of she would have been prime minister for a couple of years by now. She had a great sense of right and wrong so on her way into power, I think she would have enlisted the help of the army to dangle Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, George Osborne and David Cameron from helicopters and take them over the sea to an island. There, she would have had them dropped into a very, very deep pit. At the bottom of that pit, I feel sure that there would have been an enormous crocodile who hadn’t eaten for a very long time. Hence there would never have been any mention of Brexit or referendums. With Matilda at the helm, we would now be living in a peaceable country where all are at ease with each other. School libraries would have been a huge priority for her and libraries across the country would be blooming and full of people. Education would be at the heart of everything, and art and music would flourish again in schools. Matilda would know that it important to educate whole human beings, not cogs to fit into economies. Ed Vere new book, Goodnight, Max the Brave, will be published on October. Matt Haig: ‘She would be writing her own version of Game of Thrones’ Matilda very self-reliant, so I think at she would be doing precisely what she wanted to do. She wouldn’t rule the world, because she wouldn’t want to. I think she would be a writer, writing something vast and epic but not realistic, because she got such a good imagination. Maybe she would be writing her own version of Game of Thrones, or a harrowing memoir of her childhood. She got a lot of demons. But books would be her therapy so she wouldn’t have to be on medication or have counselling. Books will continue to be her salvation. I don’t know if she would be happy. I saw Matilda as a child as a very yearning kind of person. I feel like, as an adult, she would know happiness, but she wouldn’t be totally satisfied. She would still be on a quest for stories. Matt Haig new children book, The Truth Pixie, will be published on October. Jeff Kinney : ‘She’d work in a bookstore – but she would not be the owner’ I think she would be working in a bookstore with a robust children section. She would not be the owner. In the book, she distrustful of adults. I see management as a grey figure behind her, while Matilda is the one actually putting the book in the child hand. I think Matilda would know that that a sacred act. That what would drive her. She very curious and adventurous so, in her I think she would have bounced around the world, having a taste of everything. She spent time on an oil rig in Norway and tracked great white sharks in South Africa. But she come back home to live with Miss Honey again, because she wants to always be close to her. In her spare time, she writes fantasy books for young adults aged to Not because she wants to become a published writer, but to nurture a child who reminds her of herself – maybe an underprivileged kid she met in the bookstore one day. She would write just for that kid, to open up new worlds for them. She would write stories for dreamers. Jeff Kinney new book Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Meltdown will be published on October. Kate Pankhurst : ‘Matilda would co-found a school for children with special powers’ Along with Miss Honey, Matilda would co-found a school for children with special powers such as telekinesis, whose potential is not being tapped. It would appear to be a normal school, but Matilda would have a secret mission to find children with unusual talents, seeking out stories in newspapers and on TV. It would be a very stimulating, creative school where the children would get to make the most of their talents and do what they most enjoy. Matilda, stay young: it bittersweet to see Roald Dahl hero turn | Cressida Cowell Miss Honey would be the headmistress and Matilda would be the school librarian. Perhaps she would appear a bit reserved when you first meet her, but that would change once you got to know her and realise how warm and caring she is. Even at she would still have a love of playing tricks, so the kids would know if anyone messed with her she would think up a cunning and unusual way of getting back at them. But it definitely would not be the Chokey .

23,"he cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.” Thus Vladimir Nabokov memorably opens the first chapter of his autobiography, Speak, Memory That “brief crack of light” is what concerns us all, and the art form best constructed to examine and elucidate its many complexities is, I would argue, the novel. DH Lawrence defined it as the “one bright book of life” (once again luminosity is the metaphor). Of course, all art is an attempt to come to terms with and explain the human condition. However, the way the novel has evolved makes it supremely successful in investigating our lives – or, more significantly, revealing other lives to us. You can write a long and complicated novel about a single day in an individual existence ( Ulysses , Mrs Dalloway ) or you can write a novel about war and conquest and the decline and fall of empires ( War and Peace and the Fortunes of War and I, Claudius novels), but the novel unique power lies in its scrutiny of the human factor. No other art form – though theatre runs it close – can deal so effortlessly with the minutiae of our everyday lives. Crucially, no other art form can penetrate the subconscious mind so easily, can expose and elucidate the tiny shifts in nuance of a person behaviour and thinking. Other people are opaque, mysterious – even those closest to you. If you want to know what makes human beings tick , in every sense, good and bad, banal and sinister, read a novel. And yet, looking at the history of the form there is, it seems to me, something of a lacuna. Novels have covered every possible aspect of human experience but very few have attempted to do full justice to the entirety of that “brief crack of light” that Nabokov describes. By this I mean the whole-life or cradle-to-grave novel. The genre is small and its exemplars rare. Even long novel sequences such as Proust A la Recherche du Temps Perdu or Anthony Powell A Dance to the Music of Time end long before their protagonist demise. The life described is not complete. To attempt a definition: the whole-life novel must begin in early childhood or youth and follow, chronologically, the individual life through to that character death or near-death. One imagines that it quite common – Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope, Austen, Eliot, not to mention Balzac, Zola, Tolstoy, Melville, Twain et al … surely they wrote whole-life novels? But the great novels , for all their compendiousness and range, always offered only parts of a life, however richly detailed these were. Taking on the long baggage of an individual entire existence is not only unusual in fiction, it also demanding, technically speaking: decades of living have to be compacted into a few hundred pages. The narrative sleight of hand required over necessary matters of elision, compression and summary is complex. So what are the great exemplars of the whole-life novel? A varied collection of titles comes to mind. Perhaps the earliest is Goethe The Sorrows of Young Werther Another is Thomas Hardy Jude the Obscure . Both end with the death of their protagonists. Martin Amis has written a whole-life novel in reverse in Time Arrow – a grave-to-cradle novel. Hilary Mantel trilogy – Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies being volumes one and two – will eventually be an authentic and epic whole-life novel about Thomas Cromwell. Is Laurence Sterne The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy a whole-life novel, given that Tristram is not even born by the novel end, yet we know his destiny? Is Virginia Woolf abidingly strange novel The Waves an attempt to schematically cover the cradle-to-grave aspect of the human condition through her six characters’ monologues? Think of HG Wells The History of M r Polly , Compton Mackenzie Sinister Street and its sequels, Giuseppe di Lampedusa The Leopard . Sometimes I wonder whether – at least in the Christian western world – the whole-life narrative that lurks behind all others, the Ur-narrative, as it were, is that of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. Christ birth-to-death story (by many hands) is relayed in tremendous detail and occupies the Nabokovian prenatal darkness as well as the posthumous one – which makes it unique. The eclecticism of this random list underlines the genre idiosyncrasy. I first fell into the whole-life genre with my novel The New Confessions . I know its germination absolutely: I was trying to write a version of Jean-Jacques Rousseau Les Confessions , published in one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. But Rousseau ends the account of his life when he was I decided, for some reason, to take the narrative on into the central character very old age. At the end of the novel John James Todd – my Rousseau – is an old man. If not in his final senescence, he is waiting resignedly for his mortal clock to stop. His entire life is detailed in pages. As we read we can construct the parallel novel of our own life or postulate and prefigure how such a story might unspool The whole-life novel is also a clear act of colonisation – by fiction – of what we now call life-writing: biography, autobiography and the intimate journal. But in fiction there is a different kind of authority. It is all, paradoxically, true – because it been invented by the author. Other forms of life-writing are highly suspect and partial. Donald Rayfield, Chekhov great biographer, has defined biography as “a fiction that has to fit the documented facts”. Beyond the documented facts the biographer cannot go or can only tentatively speculate. Not so in the whole-life novel. The fundamental “truth” of a life in fiction is guaranteed – this is it, this is what happened, this is what this person felt – and these novels exploit and relish that trust from the reader absolutely. Having, somewhat to my surprise, now written five such novels – The New Confessions , Any Human Heart , Sweet Caress , Nat Tate: An American Artist and my latest, Love Is Blind – I am in a singular position to testify that the response from readers is often quite dissimilar to that afforded an orthodox novel. The reader comes to identify with the central character of the whole-life story that is being related in a different, more engaged way because they have all the necessary information, significant and insignificant. Parents, schooldays, love affairs, marriages, children, illnesses, bereavements, misfortune and good fortune, triumphs and disasters – all the biographical matter that slowly but surely fleshes out the adventitious elements of an individual life makes that life seem more real, somehow, less of a fictional construct. It the haphazard rollercoaster of a life that is key in the whole-life novel rather than a particular plot, theme or central relationship. Everything is grist to the mill for such novels and this is what distinguishes the type. Love Is Blind by William Boyd review – a rapturous return to form In the vast majority of orthodox novels, however, we are often ignorant of characters’ early lives or their middle age and old age or have only the sketchiest information. Even after the novel closure and catharsis the narrative of the rest of the life is left hanging, more often than not. We don’t really know what will become of Becky Sharp or Molly Bloom or – even – Harry Potter (though there is The Cursed Child and JK Rowling may steadily construct the whole of his life, I realise, in various media). However, there is one narrative with which we are intensely, intimately familiar – our own. I think that one of the greatest appeals of the whole-life novel is that we can see in a fictional alter ego journey from the cradle to the grave a paradigm or model of our own journey in all its aleatory and fascinating nature. As we read we can construct, if you like, the parallel novel of our own complete existence or, if we’re young, at least postulate and prefigure how such a story might unspool and be recorded. It gives the total life novel a powerful extra-literary frisson. It can be very beguiling for both the writer and the reader.

24,"he poet Mary Robinson was, said Coleridge, a woman of undoubted Genius. She published her first book while a child bride in a debtors’ prison; she was a political radical who took the future George IV as a lover; in portraits her eyes are serious and her mouth is not. But sickness being no respecter of even the most fascinating people, she acquired an infection at the age of and afterwards lived with paralysis and pain. One night in Bath, finding her suffering intolerable, she dosed herself with drops of a tincture of alcohol and opium, and drowsily composed a poem called “The Maniac”, “like a person talking in her sleep”. Inspired by the memory of a vagrant, it is not a work on which to pin a reputation, but has a place in the history of letters as the first of the English Romantic opium poems. In my Puritan youth I held the cult of the drug-addled artist in contempt. Thomas De Quincey in his voluminous sleeves? A sap, I thought, of doubtful moral fibre. William S Burroughs? What did I want with a man who shot his wife? Besides, Naked Lunch was nothing like as nasty as it thought it was. If marijuana had caused Jack Kerouac sentences to be as affectless as the rap of a fork on a Formica table, it was a pity he hadn’t confined himself to tobacco. Susan Sontag wrote on speed: this I admired, since it indicated a solid work ethic. I adored Coleridge, but flinched from the thought of him in the arms of Morpheus as I’d flinch from seeing my father naked. Secretly I admired Middlemarch Casaubon, whose ascetic and studious life was directed towards “thoroughness, justice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement”. Much later – my youth behind me; my Puritan strain softened but still present – I began to write my third novel. It was inspired by Charles Robert Maturin Melmoth the Wanderer , and in it a guilt-stricken woman encounters the myth of a cursed being wandering the world bearing witness to folly and failure. Like Casaubon, I wanted my comparisons to be just, and my arrangements effective. I was in some respects a prig, I suppose, and prided myself on my priggishness, and the pride preceded a fall; for what I have on my hands now is a novel that was written while high. Melmoth is not an opium novel – it is nothing so Romantic as that – but it is certainly an opioid one, and a gabapentin one, and a diazepam one: it is an amitriptyline and clonazepam novel, and if it did not quite come to me in a dream, I sympathise with John Milton Eve, who had something devilish squat by her ear like a toad listing “phantasms and dreams”. In the aftermath of writing it I have come to understand literary drug culture as being more properly a culture of pain, and the relieving of it; of works written under the influence both of suffering and the doped-up euphoria of respite. “My sole sensuality,” Coleridge said, “was not to be in pain.” He had eye infections and a gammy knee. Percy Bysshe Shelley had headaches; De Quincey had trigeminal neuralgia; Kurt Cobain took heroin for stomach pain. If others applied their medicine to some other kind of pain – that of boredom, say, or misery – it seemed hardly my place to cavil that this suffering had been deserving of relief, and not that. In the autumn of my body weakened by chronic illness, a disc ruptured in my lower spine. My left leg, oblivious to signals from a compressed nerve, weakened and dragged, and my foot burned as if I’d stood in the sun at noon. The pain was considerable, but tolerable. Some months later, the disc ruptured again. In my MRI scan, white streaks of muscle wastage framed the black pulp of leaking disc matter, which was pushing at the sciatic nerve like a cellist finger on a string. Seeing it, the inscrutable doctor softened. You must be in torment, he said. How would I rate my pain, from one to He looked at me. I was beyond speaking. Ten, he said. Ten. He made a note. The world dwindled down to the mattress on which I lay and sometimes howled. In a Tupperware box on the dining table (out of reach, because my husband understood that either by mistake or resolve an overdose was possible), were drugs to prevent muscle spasm, and to reduce nerve pain; there were drugs that mimicked opium, and drugs to reduce inflammation; there were drugs to flood me with serotonin and aid sleep. With anxious exactitude he recorded each dose in a small black book, and I came to know each pill. Green-and-yellow tramadol, busying itself about my limbic system and my spinal cord, could cause my head to float above the pillow. Fistfuls of Neurontin came in capsules the colour of clotted cream, and when I could walk gave me the reeling gait of a disembarked sailor. I despised the chalky dots of codeine that made me sick, but longed for the hour when I could be dosed with so large a quantity of diclofenac that it could not be administered orally. Diazepam thrice daily and never soon enough) caused in me a kind of weary resignation, and slowed my speech to that of someone half-sleeping. I was – for the first time in my life, and for some weeks, if not constantly – more or less out of my mind. I recall once dividing in two, so that my old sober self stood, walked into the corner, and looked down aghast at the figure on the mattress that rocked and groaned: who was she? Her hair was filthy. She was not dressed. She ought to be ashamed of herself. The problem with describing pain, of course, is that you can no more know what I mean by torment than I can know what you mean by love – and besides, privately we all think ourselves made of sterner stuff than the sickly. Poorly writers with time on their hands are, I suspect, rather a bore, and even more so when high. They plead their case; they become their own subject. Perhaps it is this, as much as the effusion of opium, that has created the body of work written under the influence. Shelley, who carried his laudanum about in a flask, considered freedom from pain as far from human grasp as flight: what could the skylark sing about but love of its own kind and “ignorance of pain?” Coleridge in “Sonnet: Composed in Sickness” wrote that “Tyrant Pain had chased away delight.” No wonder he retreated into laudanum: it unlocked the gates to Xanadu when all other gates were bolted. No wonder he retreated into laudanum: it unlocked the gates to Xanadu when all other gates were bolted In solitary confinement on my mattress I devised a taxonomy of pain. Virginia Woolf, prone to the flu, bemoaned the poverty of language for pain in English. How could the woman who saw the tolling of Westminster bells dissolve like leaden circles in the air not have known the whole thesaurus of suffering, and made entries of her own? Perhaps she could have done with drops of laudanum. Galen, the Greek physician, had identified four kinds of pain – the pulsating, the lancinating, the weighty and the stretching – and Avicenna expanded the canon in the century: there is the soft, the breaking, the coarse, the penetrating, the bitter and the numb. With my imagination unloosed by opioids and nothing else to do, I conceived of ways to describe my pain. Muscle spasms had me in a vice that a quiet man turned with the implacable strength of a carpenter working oak. Nerve pain was dialysis that replaced my blood with thin and icy fluids. Sometimes only the cheapest of metaphors would do. Pain was maddening: once, when I had exhausted my ration of painkillers, I beat at my leg with clenched fists. By then I had only the opening pages of my novel in hand, and months of research into atrocity and genocide behind me. The fruit of that study went rotten on the branch, because I could not put it to use. I tried to dictate to a laptop on the floor by my pillow, but what appeared on the screen was a poor effort, and in any case I could barely read. The urge to write became a question of lancing a boil: I was full of poisonous matter and needed to let it out. I did not hallucinate. No monsters jostled my mattress unless summoned. I have never been one of those writers who say: “I saw him, this character of mine – he was standing on a station platform with a red coat and he bared his teeth at me.” My characters are plot devices that do as they’re damn well told. But in those drugged months the monsters I summoned were vivid and ghastly. De Quincey lamented opium effects of intellectual torpor, but described with pleasure “the reawakening of a state of eye generally incident to childhood”. Did his reader know, he said, that children “have a power of painting, as it were upon the darkness, all sorts of phantoms”? I regained the eye of childhood. One night a pale girl stood in my room in a party dress and frilled white socks. In Prague an opera house filled with jackdaw feathers, and somebody somewhere was burning alive. Might I have written a sober affair, had I not been under the influence? Perhaps not – I have never needed tramadol to be attended by angels, or to feel demons pricking my feet. But I think of Vincent van Gogh, who looked at the world through the yellowish haze conveyed by digitalis, and grew enraptured by sunflowers and straw chairs, and I think of a glass prism through which a beam of white light passes and is split into a rainbow. What had been a single lucid idea had passed through the drugs I took and been dispersed into a spectrum of colours I had only half foreseen. In the century, East Anglians worn out by working on the fens called laudanum “elevation”. How apt! If I was not exactly happy, a curious kind of stoicism descended on me. I was willing to look horrors both real and imagined dead in the eye, which can be nothing but useful to the novelist. At about that time I had burned the deadened skin of my leg with a hot-water bottle, and was left for weeks with a necrotising hole. Twice a day I peeled back the dressing and sluiced the wound with saline and did it quite cheerfully and disinterestedly, as if I were attending to someone else. I was tranquillised, a little euphoric. And the book was full of burning: with acid, with petrol, with bundles made of young green wood to make the burning slower. Later, weaned off the tramadol and the diazepam, I could not bear to look, and would plead with others to do it for me. When in time my pain outgrew the contents of the Tupperware box, my GP said: next, we try morphine. I was appalled. I did not want to be one of Alfred, Lord Tennyson “mild-eyed melancholy lotus-eaters”. Tramadol is cousin to heroin, but morphine is her sister. I would strangle a dog, I thought, for respite, but I drew the line at smack. The shame I obscurely felt, and the notion it would be immoral to pass idle months drowsily sucking at a bottle of opiates, was a modern anxiety. Mary Robinson had not felt she was transgressing; Jane Austen mother had recommended opium for travel sickness; Louisa May Alcott took opium after a bout of typhoid fever. In the Cyclopaedia of Six Thousand Household Recipes provided instructions for opium remedies for sleepless babies. Opium, it suggested, may be mixed with quince and oils of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and mace. Opium enemas are advised. Coleridge relied on the potent Kendal Black Drop, which included treacle and vegetable oil to aid its digestion. The drug itself carried no stigma – but an excess of it, as with an excess of anything, was a disgrace. Coleridge felt the shame deeply and in in Malta, he wrote: “I have never sought pleasure for its own sake, but only as a means of escaping the pains that coiled around my mental powers, as a serpent around the body and wings of an Eagle!” My own person from Porlock came in the form of Mr Rai, a Norwich neurosurgeon, who intervened before morphine last resort. He opened my back and released the crushed sciatic nerve from its tormentor and I was transported into a world in which walking and sitting and coughing and turning did not cause me to wonder if death, on the whole, would be preferable. The morning after surgery he stood lightly stroking my feet. Feel this, he asked. I could. I had not been paralysed. There is nothing, I said. There is no pain, there is nothing, I am in no pain at all! He laughed, and said that I was (a clear tube drained blood from my flank into a glass flagon set on the floor), but that it simply did not register. It was too mild, in comparison: the parameters had shifted. I am no longer elevated but the doors that opened do not seem to have been firmly bolted. Months later, in the attic of a house in St Andrews, under the influence of nothing but chamomile tea, I felt the covers slip from my feet and the whole bed sink while floorboards creaked underfoot. I consulted the Sunday School lessons stored on the shelves of my mind. The Bible did not provide, strictly speaking, for ghosts; but advised a simple stern command for the banishment of demons. This, I felt, would hardly suffice: the bedcovers slipped again. I sang Psalm until I fell asleep, mocking myself a little, but to no effect. I have never sought pleasure for its own sake, but only as a means of escaping pains that coiled around my mental powers Samuel Taylor Coleridge Casaubon-like, sober, ascetic in my habits, I turned diligently to the novel. Permitted to sit for short periods at my desk I worked and reworked the manuscript. The sleep of reason had bred monsters that required the red pen. I cut, and pasted, and jostled, and scowled; in time it became impossible to judge what had been written before the pain, what during, and what after. Sometimes I reflect on that time – the mattress, the pills and the little black book, the taxonomy of pain – and cheerfully concede that it was not a waste. I had resolved to write a novel that would force the reader to bear witness to wickedness, and it had demanded that I bear witness too. I had been given a brief period of suffering against which to measure the suffering of others, and sometimes the courage – dispensed each fortnight by the supermarket pharmacist – to face both. Grateful for my good fortune at escaping pain, and escaping with nothing to show for it but two scars and a slight limp, I illuminated the dark materials of my research and my dreams with the promise, or at least the possibility, of redemption. Wherever I go I carry a little beaded bag containing my few remaining tramadol, a strip or two of diazepam. I do not need them – I am quite well; I sometimes run; I sleep easily – but all the same … “Today I shall sing more sweetly,” said Coleridge, “but the tomorrow is yet to come.” Melmoth is published by Profile.

25,"X marks the spot: Robert Macfarlane on Treasure Island In the beginning was the map. Robert Louis Stevenson drew it in the summer of to entertain his stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, while on a rainy family holiday in Scotland. It depicts a rough-coasted island of woods, peaks, swamps and coves. A few place names are marked, which speak of adventure and disaster: Spyeglass Hill, Graves, Skeleton Island. The penmanship is deft, confident – at the island southern end is an intricate compass rose, and the sketch of a galleon at full sail. Figures signal the depth in fathoms of the surrounding sea, and there are warnings to mariners: “Strong tide here”, “Foul ground”. In the heart of the island is a blood-red cross, by which is scrawled the legend “Bulk of treasure here”. Stevenson map was drawn to set a child dreaming, but it worked most powerfully on its grownup author, inspiring him to write his great pirate novel, Treasure Island . Poring over the map with Lloyd, he began to populate his landscape with characters (Long John Silver, Captain Flint, Jim Hawkins) and to thicken it with plot. From that flat page sprang up one of the most compellingly realised of imaginary places. Countless children have made landfall on its blond beaches, moved cautiously through its grey woods and seen sunlight flash hard on the wild stone spires of its crags. Once visited, the island inhabits you. We are now habituated to regard cartography as a science: an endeavour of exacting precision, whose ambition is the elimination of subjectivity from the representation of a given place. But before it was a field science, cartography was – as Stevenson proved – an art. It was an art that mingled knowledge and supposition, that told stories about places, and in which astonishment, love, memory and fear were part of its projections. It is instructive to consider these earlier artistic forms of mapping, for they exemplify neglected ways of proceeding within a landscape. Broadly speaking, we might say there are two types of map: the grid map and the story map. A grid map places an abstract geometric meshwork upon a space, a meshwork within which any item or individual can be coordinated. The power of such maps is that they make it possible for any individual or object to be located within an abstract totality of space. Their danger is that they so reduce the world to data that they record space independent of being. Story maps, by contrast, represent a place as it is perceived by an individual or by a culture moving through it. They are records of specific journeys, rather than describing a space within which journeys might take place. They are organised around the passage of the traveller, and their perimeters are the perimeters of the sight or experience of that traveller. The grid map has proved an efficient method for converting place into resource, and for devising large-scale approaches to a landscape. It is a way of representing the world that has brought uncountable benefits, but so authoritative is its method, so apparently irrefutable the knowledge it dispenses about a place, that it has all but eliminated our sense of the worth of map-as-story: of cartography that is self-made, felt, sensuous. Cultures that grow up in close correspondence with a particular terrain often develop innovative methods of representing that terrain. In at Cape Prince of Wales in the Canadian Arctic, a British naval officer encountered a hunting party of Inuit. Unable to communicate directly with the officer, but comprehending his desire for orientation, the Inuit created a map on the beach, using sticks, stones and pebbles “in a very ingenious and intelligible manner” to build a scaled replica of the region. The Inuit people are also known to have carved three-dimensional maps of coastlines from wood. In this way, the maps were portable, resistant to cold and, if they were dropped into water, would float and could be retrieved. Inhabitants of the Marshall Islands used sticks and shells, bound together with plant fibre, to create similarly buoyant accounts of the ocean currents that ran between the islands of their archipelago. We would do well to recall these felt maps – for they are born of experience and of attention. Such maps, held in the mind, are alert to a landscape changeability as well as its fixtures. They tell of the inches and tints of things. They offer knowledge that might be found, as it were, off-grid. And they are sensitive to the mysterious fourth and fifth dimensions of cartography – the relationship of mapmaker to landscape, and the relationship of map-reader to map. Snufkin in Moominland: Frances Hardinge on Tove Jansson map I remember poring over the Moominland map at the front of Tove Jansson Finn Family Moomintroll . The map is homely, crowded and jubilantly out of scale, yet also haunting. Like the books themselves, the map always touched me with a gentle and inexplicable sadness. I imagined the Lonely Mountains isolated by their own vastness and strangeness, their slow, cold hearts filled with a drear and incurable loneliness. But even then I noticed that one feature of the little map was not accurate, except in the sense that a stopped clock is right twice a day. Near a bridge is drawn a small tent, and beside it sits a little figure in a tapering hat. This is clearly meant to show the campsite of the green-clad, harmonica-playing Snufkin. But Snufkin cannot be pinned to a location so easily. He is an inveterate nomad, vanishing from the Moominvalley for long months at a time, then returning without warning or explanation. He was probably packing up his tent before the ink on the map had dried. Unlike me, Snufkin never fears losing his way, because “his way” is wherever his feet lead him. He is content, intrepid, at ease. There is nowhere he needs to be, only paths he chooses as the whim takes him. He is free. About the only things that ever upset him are fences, which offend his philosophy of freedom. Fences carve up the world into this and that, yours and mine, in an attempt to tame it and make sense of it. Maps arguably do the same, and perhaps that is why Snufkin never seems to carry one. Did it daunt those early cartographers to know that they were shaping everybody idea of reality? When I first laid eyes on that Moominvalley map, I was content to let my mind swoop down into it, and never asked myself which character was supposed to have created it, or why. I never stopped to wonder whether it had been drawn by fussy Hemulen hands, or scrawled with a charred stick from some summer campfire, or lovingly sketched by Moominmamma so that young trolls could find their way home. Now, of course, I notice the extra attention paid to the layout of the Moomins’ own dwelling, and exciting details such as caves and camping spots. It is a map that a child of the Moominhouse might have drawn, with a child deep-seated understanding of what is important. Back then, the map was the map, and that was all. It showed what there was, or at least what I needed to know. My fascination with the makers of maps came later. I learned to love old maps of our own world, the big, crazy, beautiful ones where countries have implausible, doughy outlines and the oceans are full of guesswork and sea monsters. In their day they must have been mind-blowing, revelatory. Now they are second cousins to the fantasy landscapes, with the same mystery and mournful sense of a place forever beyond reach. The past becomes an imaginary other-land with its own geography. You can almost sense the seams where the maps have been stitched together from travellers’ tales, other maps, rumour, legend and wishful thinking. Did it daunt those early cartographers to know that they were shaping everybody idea of reality? How could they cram in everything important? What was important? The glory and heroism of cartography is that it attempts the impossible. Reality is unmappable – too big, sprawling and changeable to be captured entire on paper or canvas. It like trying to trap a giant squid with a rock pool net. Navigating Hogwarts: Miraphora Mina on making the Marauder Map The phone rang one Monday morning. It remarkable to think now how the conversation that followed led to a project that would fill the next years of my life. It was the production designer Stuart Craig, inviting me to join his creative team to work on the adaptation of a novel. He described the new project as a story “about a magic school, a brave young boy and a dark wizard” and left it at that. The very first thing I created was the letter inviting Harry to Hogwarts. Mr H Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Those words are a map in themselves, a path to an unpredictable future, an invitation into a new world. I agonised for days about the right balance of delicate marks to place on an envelope, such a simple thing really, but it was important: a handwritten address on a letter delivered by an owl to a boy who did not yet know his destiny. I wanted to create a map that would confuse unless you had all the skills to decode it Of all the things our team produced for the world of Harry Potter , the Marauder Map is the object that readers seem to love the most. A blank document that reveals all the secret passages of Hogwarts, it first appeared in the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , and we soon started thinking about how to actually make it. I knew immediately I didn’t want it to be an obvious burned-at-the-edges kind of treasure map, but rather something much more complex, multilayered. As an object I wanted there to be a logic to opening and folding it, while it would be deliberately bewildering at the same time. A map that would confuse unless you had all the skills to decode it, as well as being a map that continued to reveal new things each time it was used. Folding paper is an artform and we engineered the map as best we could, channelling the spirit of Escher impossible staircases. Everything was handmade, cut, drawn and delicately sewn and glued. That it really: ink, paper and a great deal of care. Through the course of the films I probably made copies as props. I often regretted it being so intricate, but there is no other way to make something that is beautiful and that can honour a book people love so much. UK worst-selling map: The empty landscape charted by In doing so, the lines between the real and the fantasy, between the reference source and the recreated, are narrowed. The artefacts seem real, perhaps even more real. They are alive. As makers, it also about a totality of experience. Although many of the things we create might never be shown on screen, they are seen by the actors and “felt” by the audience. For me, the best stories are those where real and imaginary places are constantly overlapping, colliding perhaps, the fantasy and the everyday, both magic and muggle.

26,"A radical reframing of our understanding of the teenage mind, that explains typically ridiculed behaviours such as risk-taking, emotional instability and heightened self-consciousness as outward signs of great transformation, has won the prestigious Royal Society prize for science book of the year. Two thousand years since Socrates said that teenagers have “bad manners, contempt for authority, show disrespect for elders and love chatter in the place of exercise”, Inventing Ourselves: The Secret Life of the Teenage Brain by neuroscientist Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore has scooped the prize on Monday night. Blakemore is the fourth woman to win the prize over its history, and also the fourth in a row, following Cordelia Fine for her book Testosterone Rex last year, Andrea Wulf in for The Invention of Nature and Gaia Vince for Adventures in the Anthropocene in ‘Teens get a bad rap’: the neuroscientist championing moody adolescents In the book, Blakemore demonstrates how the human brain develops during adolescence and how previously unknown details of this process mean society treatment of the often-maligned group should change. Self-absorption, hyper-sensitivity and risk-taking, she explains, are all reasonable responses when the biological purpose of adolescence is the creation of a sense of self. She has argued that GCSEs impose enormous stress on teenagers during a period of huge neurological change, and recommends that they should go to bed later and start school later, as evidence shows the brain circadian rhythm is knocked out of kilter during puberty. She also shows that the brain levels of white and grey matter continue to shift long after our teen years, meaning the period of human adolescence could be considered to last until our and Judges for the prize praised Blakemore inclusion of her own laboratory research in the book, conducted as professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, working in what she calls “a young science”. They also praised Blakemore for examining how stressful experiences during her formative years may have shaped her own development; she grew up under police protection because her father, the scientist Sir Colin Blakemore, received death threats from animal rights groups and was once targeted by a mail bomber. “The biggest emotion I had was, I was so embarrassed,” Blakemore told the Guardian in August, about her reaction at the time . “At school there would be bomb scares. Everybody would know it was possibly targeted towards us, and that was just devastatingly embarrassing.” Professor Dame Frances Ashcroft, chair of judges and professor of physiology at Oxford, said Inventing Ourselves was “completely captivating” and “truly a book that everyone should read”. She said it stood out “because it addresses an important but somewhat neglected area that affects every one of us”. “She given us a different view of the teenager and corrected all the myths that people have started out with. It is a very important book because she teaching us to look at teenagers in a completely different way. These are people in a period of great creativity, not just moody individuals,” she told the Guardian. “The best science writing helps us to look at ourselves and our world in new ways, and does this by combining compelling storytelling with scientific depth and detail,” said Professor Brian Cox, the Royal Society professor for public engagement in science. “This book not only has all of these qualities, but also has something to offer every reader – whether you are a teenager, parent of a teenager, or just interested in understanding your former teenage self.” Inventing Ourselves was chosen from a six-book shortlist that spanned the sciences, including Lucy Cooke examination of zoological myths, The Unexpected Truth About Animals; Daniel M Davis study of the immune system, The Beautiful Cure ; Liquid by the winner Mark Miodownik; Hello World , Hannah Fry study of artificial intelligence and algorithms; and Simon Winchester book on precision engineers, Exactly. Joining Professor Ashcroft as judges were Dr Leigh Fletcher, associate professor in planetary sciences; Peter Florence, director and co-founder of the Hay festival; scientist and broadcaster Vivienne Parry; and Greg Williams, editor of Wired magazine.

27,"More than years after Samuel Johnson asserted that “no man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money”, a comprehensive new survey of the UK authors has found that many make nothing at all from their writing. According to a report into the earnings of almost working writers released on Monday by Queen Mary, University of London, there is a “huge inequality” in the amount of money made by writers, with the top earners taking a vast proportion of the total money earned. The top of professional authors, those who make or more a year from their writing, earned of all the money made by professional authors in and the top those making more than earned of that money. The top who make mean average earnings of more than take of all earnings, said the Authors’ Licensing &amp; Collecting Society, which commissioned the UK-based survey. The picture for lower-earning writers was much bleaker. The bottom of authors were those who earned less than in and accounted for just of the amount earned by all writers put together. And of all writers did not earn anything at all during said the ALCS, adding that of those authors had published a work every year from to “Thus, at least of writers are continuing to work without any expectation of earnings,” said the report, The Business of Being an Author. “It appears that writing is a profession where only a handful of successful authors make a very good living while most do not.” Philip Pullman, president of the Society of Authors, condemned the findings as “a national disgrace”. The award-winning author of the His Dark Materials trilogy said: “In the past ten years, while publishers’ earnings have remained steady, the incomes of those on whom they entirely depend have diminished, on average, by While bankers and hedge fund managers (who do nothing that can be understood) gather in more money than can be imagined, the work of authors (who give delight, or knowledge, or consolation) is rewarded on average with little more than of the national median earnings. “While Amazon makes earnings of indescribable magnitude by selling our books for a fraction of their value, and then pays as little tax as it possibly can, the authors whose work subsidises this gargantuan barbarity are facing threats to their livelihood from several directions: from publishers’ increasing habit of letting backlists disappear while concentrating largely on proven bestsellers, as well as from the government obvious disinclination to do anything to help keep the library sector alive.” Nicola Solomon, Society of Authors’ chief executive, said “We are not surprised to see that there is a high concentration of earnings in a handful of successful writers whereas most do not earn much at all; that has always been the case. However we are saddened to see that the inequality is increasing.” She added: “That confirms our observations that publishers are tending more and more to concentrate on safe choices and celebrity brands, sometimes at the expense of supporting backlist and midlist authors who sell steadily but more slowly.” Solomon also pointed to the difference in earnings between genres: according to the survey, adult fiction writers made a mean net income of in children fiction non-fiction writers travel writers and academic authors “Non-fiction and particularly academic writers fare badly in comparison with fiction,” she said. “It is notable that in the areas where income is lowest, terms and conditions are worst. Academic writers are less likely to have received advances and fiction writers are more than twice as likely to retain their copyright than academic writers or travel writers. We have long been concerned that the worsening of terms in academic and educational writing is leading to a decline in writers in these fields as it is simply not worthwhile to write the type of quality books for which Britain is renowned and which contributed to the huge export sales of British books last year.” James Dawson, an award-winning young adult novelist, is a full-time writer. “That because I decided to make it work,” he said. “I pitched a non-fiction title because I thought if I’m able to write two books a year I’ll be able to manage. I also do one day a week for a charity, and I write journalism. I just have to make it work, but then I don’t have a mortgage, or kids – no one depending on me.” Dawson said he didn’t begrudge the top their sales. “It the fact there such a gap – it feels like there nothing in the middle,” he said. “I was lucky to get a really good deal as a debut author; it seems publishers gamble a lot on a debut, but then if it doesn’t pay off, the pay plummets. But that the system, and I don’t see it changing. There an element of alchemy to it – they’re trying to create gold, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.” Daniel Hahn, chair of the Society of Authors, said: “Anybody interested seeing in a future with books in it should be profoundly troubled by what today report is telling us.” The comprehensive report follows the release of initial findings from the survey last summer that the median earnings of a professional author, defined as someone who spends more than half their working life on self-employed writing, were just down in real terms on and less than the minimum wage. The median earnings of all authors were just Secondary sources of income are limited for authors, as Pullman pointed out: “The writers of the books that we know people love to read cannot earn a living by going on tour, filling stadiums night after night, and then signing books at the door. Our business doesn’t work like that. We’re not demanding special treatment: just pointing out the need for simple financial justice.” Queen Mary also revealed that “there remains a significant gender pay gap among professional authors”, with women writers earning of that earned by men, compared to in the population as a whole. This “discouraging finding”, said the report, is “balanced slightly” when the earnings of all writers, not just those who define themselves as “professional”, are included: female writers then earn of what male writers make. Just over a quarter – – of respondents had self-published a book in the last year, revealed the report. The top of self-published writers made a profit of or more, and the top made almost But the bottom of DIY earners made losses of at least revealed the report, adding: “it remains a risky venture therefore, but one where there are meaningful returns on investment in some cases”. David J Rodger , who has self-published nine novels, said that “if I was to value the time I’ve spent writing, according to my commercial rate as a digital project manager then I am definitely in the ‘making a loss’ category”. But he still chasing “the big success.

28,"very writer, of school age and older, is in the sentences game. The sentence is our writing commons, the shared ground where all writers walk. A poet writes in sentences, and so does the unsung author who came up with “Items trapped in doors cause delays”. The sentence is the Ur-unit, the core material, the granular element that must be got right or nothing will be right. For James Baldwin, the only goal was “to write a sentence as clean as a bone”. What can celebrated writers teach the rest of us about the art of writing a great sentence? A common piece of writing advice is to make your sentences plain, unadorned and invisible. George Orwell gave this piece of advice its epigram: “Good prose is like a windowpane.” A reader should notice the words no more than someone looking through glass notices the glass. Except that you do notice the glass. Picture an English window in when Orwell wrote that sentence. It would be smeared with grime from smoke and coal dust and, since houses were damp and windows single-glazed, wont to mist and ice over. The glass might still be cracked from air-raid gunfire or bombs, or covered with shatterproof coating to protect people from flying shards. An odd metaphor to use, then, for clear writing. Behind Orwell windowpane theory of prose lies a puritan pride, a sense that the writer will be purified by a clean, sinewy style as by an early morning run and a cold shower. “The great enemy of clear language is insincerity,” he wrote. Insincere writing spat out tired idioms “like a cuttlefish spurting out ink”. Bad ideas were the bedfellows of bad prose. Fake thoughts made fake sentences. Some of this is true but none of it is a good way of learning how to write a sentence. More ethical demand than useful advice, it forces writers back to their own reserves of wisdom and authenticity. It blames bad writing on laziness and dishonesty, when a likelier culprit is lack of skill. If you ordered me to make a blancmange, all I could come up with would be a gloopy, inedible mess – not because I am lazy or dishonest, but because, although I have some vague idea that it needs sugar, cornflour and boiled milk, I don’t know how to make a blancmange. Orwell saw the plain English sentence as the sword of existential truth, a cure-all for the bad faith of modern life. But much of the time he didn’t even follow his own advice. “If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out,” he ordered. Perhaps he should have written: “If you can cut a word, do.” Orwell prose, as well as ignoring his own rules when it suits, is really a beautiful contrivance. Take the last thing he wrote, in his hospital notebook: “At everyone has the face he deserves.” This unforgettable sentence has an argument behind it that a moment thought will reveal as unfair and untrue. Orwell oeuvre is full of such sentences that read like eternal verities and turn out to be nonsense. “We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine gun.” (We didn’t.) “Serious sport … is war minus the shooting.” (War minus the shooting isn’t war.) “Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness.” (Steady on.) A good sentence imposes a logic on the world weirdness. It gets its power from the tension between the ease of its phrasing and the shock of its thought slid cleanly into the mind. A sentence, as it proceeds, is a paring away of options. Each added word, because of the English language dependence on word order, reduces the writer alternatives and narrows the reader expectations. But even up to the last word the writer has choices and can throw in a curveball. A sentence can begin in one place and end in another galaxy, without breaking a single syntactic rule. The poet Wayne Koestenbaum calls it “organising lava”, this pleasure to be got from “pushing a sentence in a wrong direction without altering its sweet grammatical composure”. A sentence is much more than its literal meaning. It is a living line of words where logic and lyric meet A memorable sentence makes immediate sense but sounds just slightly odd. The model Kate Moss , once asked for her motto, replied: “Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels” – a terrible message to send about dieting and body image, but a well-turned sentence, surely. Skinny, usually an adjective, is here turned into an abstract noun, paired with another abstract noun, nothing. And yet skinny is also quasi-concrete, because where it lies in the sentence suggests that it can actually be felt, just as food has a taste. But feels also retains its non-sensuous sense of intuiting or experiencing something: skinny feels good. As the sentence ends with the snap of a stressed syllable, our perspective has been altered in a way that feels true, even if we don’t share the sentiment. Reality has shifted a little and then clicked back into place. A sentence is much more than its literal meaning. It is a living line of words where logic and lyric meet – a piece of both sense and sound, albeit the sound is only heard in the reader head. Rookie sentence-writers are often too busy worrying about the something they are trying to say and don’t worry enough about how that something looks and sounds. They look straight past the words into the meaning that they have strong-armed into them. They fasten on content and forget about form – forgetting that content and form are the same thing, that what a sentence says is the same as how it says it. The word “sentence” comes from the Latin sentire, to feel. A sentence must be felt by the reader, and a feeling is something that grows and fades like anything else that is alive. A line of words should unfold in space and time, not reveal itself all at once, for the simple reason that it cannot be read all at once. John Donne sermons are full of sentences that are ever-alert and open to the world: “And into that gate they shall enter, and in that house they shall dwell, where there shall be no Cloud nor Sun, no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light … ”. His sentences puzzle out their purposes in allusive phrases that hold the attention briefly before the next phrase takes to the floor. They flaunt their learning but revel in the loose-fitting ligatures of speech and thought. Donne prose, just like his poetry, is a sort of heartfelt thinking. It brings together judgment and gentleness, reason and passion, acerbity and receptivity. You can actually see him working it all out in front of you on the page, as each sentence moves and gathers force under the prickling itch of the moment – as if he is scrabbling his way towards a beautiful truth just beyond reach. It all in the verbs. Virginia Woolf wrote that she wanted to go beyond the “formal railway line of sentence”, to show how people “feel or think or dream … all over the place”. Her serpentine sentences, held loosely together with dashes and commas, catch the butterfly restiveness of the human mind, and the evanescence of human life, as they come up against the more solid surfaces of the world. Like every skilled writer, though, Woolf starkly varies sentence length. Her long, elastic thought refrains collide with shorter, percussive fragments. A year into the second world war, she wrote this defiant sentence in her diary: “Thinking is my fighting.” Even if that doesn’t have what style guides tend to like – a concrete subject and a strong verb – it has a low rumble of energy running through it. Why? Because, apart from the possessive pronoun my, it consists wholly of verbs or verb forms. A good lesson for any writer: make each sentence worth reading, and something in it will lead the reader into the next one A decade ago the American writer Gary Lutz gave a lecture to Columbia University students titled “The sentence is a lonely place”. Lutz told them that he was drawn to writing in which “the sentence is a complete, portable solitude, a minute immediacy of consummated language”. He wanted to read books that he could open at any page and find a sentence – “a totality, an omnitude, unto itself” – that gave him something illuminating and cherishable all on its own. Contemporary writers mostly side with Lutz. They leave space and silence between their sentences, so that the reader can see the full stop and hear its click. Sentences have become less shackled to each other. Those written a few hundred years ago typically began with a whereof or a howsobeit, to resume an unfinished thought. And they used lots of conjunctive adverbs, those connecting words like moreover, namely and indeed. Such adverbs are in historical retreat. The use of indeed peaked in print in the century and has been declining ever since. The number of howevers and moreovers has been falling since the Readers today can link sentences in their heads without lots of thuses and whereupons to do it for them. Just as cinemagoers have learned to see the implied continuity of time across the quick cuts of a film, without needing a caption that says “meanwhile, back at the ranch”, so have readers learned to make a little cognitive jump between sentences. A lot of contemporary writing treats its sentences as lonely places, and then joins them together through evocative juxtaposition – the convergence of their collective solitude, if you like. This makes the sentences at the start and end of paragraphs crucial, because that is where the biggest thought-leap occurs. You can alter the whole tone of a sentence by moving it from the end of a paragraph to the start of a new one, and vice versa. Annie Dillard likes to start or end her paragraphs by swerving into unexpected terrain: “Why do we concern ourselves over which side of the membrane of soil our feet poke?” Maggie Nelson leaves gravid pauses between her sentences and paragraphs, where implications sit. Her book The Argonauts tells the story of a developing romance and relationship in short paragraphs and single sentences surrounded by white space. One paragraph begins with a sentence that sparingly conveys a new intimacy: “And then, just like that, I was folding your son laundry.” If a writer sentences have enough life and interest in them – with “every step an arrival”, as Rainer Maria Rilke put it – they will hold the reader and move the writing along. The writing finds a hidden unity that has no need of the mucilage of linking phrases. Each sentence is like a tidal island that looks cut off until, at low tide, a causeway to the mainland appears. A good lesson for any writer: make each sentence worth reading, and something in it will lead the reader into the next one. Good writers write not just in sentences but with sentences.

29,"Jean-Claude Arnault, the man at the centre of a sexual abuse and financial misconduct scandal that forced the postponement of this year Nobel prize in literature, has been convicted of rape. In a unanimous verdict, Stockholm district court sentenced Arnault – the husband of a member of the Swedish Academy, which awards the world most prestigious literary prize – to two years in prison, the minimum sentence. The judge, Gudrun Antemar, said there was “sufficient evidence, consisting mainly of statements during the trial by the injured party and several witnesses”, to convict the defendant of one of the two counts of rape with which he had been charged. The verdict came at the start of Nobel prize week, shortly before the award for medicine was announced. Arnault lawyer, Björn Hurtig, earlier told local media his client would appeal if convicted. He has said his client strenuously denies all charges against him, describing them as a witch-hunt based on fundamentally flawed evidence. After a trial held behind closed doors, the public prosecutor, Christina Voigt, had called for the Frenchman to be sentenced to at least three years in jail. The maximum sentence for rape in Sweden is six years. Arnault, an influential figure in Sweden cultural scene for many decades, faced charges of forcing a woman to engage in oral sex and intercourse in a Stockholm apartment on October and of raping her again on December in the same apartment while she was asleep. In a statement, the court said Arnault, who reportedly bragged of being the academy member” , had been found guilty on the first count and acquitted on the second. “The injured party has been awarded compensation for damages,” it added. The scandal first erupted last November when the Dagens Nyheter newspaper published detailed allegations by women accusing Arnault – who describes himself as a photographer – of rape, sexual harassment, physical abuse and harassment over a period of more than years, in Sweden and France . Eight women filed formal complaints, but all bar one of the cases were subsequently dropped for lack of evidence or because they had exceeded the statute of limitations. The woman in the case that came to trial – a writer and academic – told police of the assaults a few days after the Dagens Nyheter report was published, saying she had not come forward earlier because Arnault was a good friend of her manager. Bitter internal disputes over how to handle the accusations against Arnault led to the departure of seven of the academy members, including his wife, Katarina Frostenson, a poet and playwright who stepped down in April at the same time as the organisation then permanent secretary, Sara Danius. In May, the academy – which was founded by King Gustav III in and is still under royal patronage – announced that in view of its “currently diminished” membership and the public “reduced confidence” in its deliberations, it would not be awarding a prize this year. Two laureates are to be announced in For many years, Arnault and Frostenson ran Forum, a club in Stockholm that showcased exhibitions and readings by prominent cultural personalities including Nobel laureates. The club was partly funded by the academy, prompting secondary allegations of a conflict of interest. As the scandal unfolded, Dagens Nyheter also reported that an internal investigation by the academy had concluded Arnault may have leaked the names of seven Nobel literature laureates – the subject of heavy betting – in advance of their announcement, including those of Bob Dylan in and Harold Pinter in",593,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/01/jean-claude-arnault-centre-nobel-scandal-jailed-rape
30,"legy, an individual response to the death of a person or a group, began in Greece and Rome as a particular metrical form. But elegies are among the greatest poems in every language, whatever their form. Traditionally, they mirror three elements of mourning: grief; memories of the dead; and some kind of consolation – because people in grief often find relief in poems expressing a loss they thought was unique to them. But elegy took me completely by surprise, just as death itself can do. When I began work on my new collection Emerald , I was simply interested in the gems themselves, their mining, myths, geology, history. I talked to emerald cutters, pondered the paradoxical symbolism of green, colour of envy and poison as well as magic. Then, very suddenly, my old mum was rushed to hospital. During that dark time, the emeralds surprised me by triggering a flood of poems about her: her jokes and determination, the pleasure she took in talking to old friends, the generous mutual support of everyone in the family as she died; my childhood memories of her; snapshots of her childhood. After she died, I realised that because she was a biologist, and passionate naturalist, these jewels signifying spring, hope and renewal were also offering, totally unexpectedly, true elegiac consolation in the saving green of nature. Elegies are a rich seam in poetry, so I have divided my choices into distinct sub-genres. Elegy for a child: A Part Song by Denise Riley ( from Say Something Back ) The worst loss of all. Riley heart-rending poem on the death of her adult son follows a powerful tradition of lament for children that includes the poem Pearl, in which a father loses his “pearl” in a garden, and Ben Jonson poem On My First Son . Riley poem begins by questioning the point of poetry and “song”, but goes on, through vivid domestic memories evoking the infant, the boy and the man, to demonstrate how very powerful elegy can be, and how loss is at the heart of all lyric poetry. Elegy for a mother : Freud Beautiful Things by Emily Berry (from Stranger Baby ) Nearly everyone loses a mother. But relationships with mothers vary and everyone loss is different. Seamus Heaney sequence for his mother, Clearances , is gentle and measured; Berry opens her breathtaking book on her mum death (when she herself was seven) with Freud comment that “the loss of a mother must be something very strange”. Freud Beautiful Things is an exquisitely controlled journey through loss, chaos, hurt and anger, but also love and hope. Elegy for a father: Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by Dylan Thomas Thomas poem for his dying father is a villanelle , a form in which two lines repeat (just as thoughts recur obsessively in grief) and appear together in the hard-hitting ending: “Do not go gentle into that good night. / Rage, rage against the dying of the light.” Sylvia Plath poem Daddy is a more savagely conflicted variation, driven not only by loss but by the fury at abandonment that also needs to be acknowledged in mourning. “I was ten when they buried you. / At twenty I tried to die / And get back, back, back to you.” Elegy for a wife: Orpheus and Eurydice by Czeslaw Milosz , translated by the author and Robert Hass (from Selected and Last Poems, ) In this marvellous poem, the Polish-Lithuanian Milosz, entering the hospital to visit his dying wife, becomes Orpheus braving the underworld and failing to recover Eurydice. Another more recent, devastating elegy for a wife is Ian Patterson The Plenty of Nothing , for Jenny Diski. Further back in this tradition are Milton sonnet, Methought I saw my late espoused saint , and Thomas Hardy The Voice , the latter written at a moment when the death of his wife, with whom relations had broken down, turned a great novelist into an even greater poet. Elegy for a husband : Elegy for my husband by Toi Derricotte This harrowing poem foregrounds injustice in her husband early life: “the aunt bleeding out on the highway / (too black for the white ambulance to pick up).” It memorialises his body: both her own memories of it (“the hand that laid itself over my heart and saved me / the eyes that held the long gold tunnel I believed in”) and its private past: “muscles which white girls longed to touch / but must not … You would be lynched in that all-white town you grew up in.” The poem ends with bare, inescapable loss: “All that is gone.” The only consolation here is in the artistry, the true placing of beautiful, powerful words. Elegy for a brother: Poem by Catullus , translated by Anne Carson ( from Nox by Anne Carson ) This famous Latin poem was written in original “elegiac couplets” by the Roman poet Catullus for his brother, who died far away from Rome. Tragically aware it is addressing “silent ash”, the poem ends ave atque vale , “hail and farewell”. Carson memorialised her own dead brother by translating this as the centrepiece in a memory-box of scraps for her brother: a box that Carson (echoing Catullus Poem Five which says, “once our brief light is set, we must sleep a perpetual night”) labelled Nox – “ Night”. An echo-box that doubles as a tomb. Elegy for an idealised girl: She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways by William Wordsworth A lost loved girl is a potent muse. Wordsworth “Lucy” poems evoke unrequited love. Scholars argue whether she really existed, this Lucy who lived and died unnoticed by everyone but Wordsworth, who never told. His haunting poem projects onto Lucy his own sense of loneliness and loss, just as it was the death of a friend daughter that inspired Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke to write his mysterious elegiac sequence Sonnets to Orpheus , in which the archetypal poet searches for the dead girl he will always fail to bring back to the light. Elegy for a fellow poet: In Memory of WB Yeats by WH Auden A poet sense of vocation can be tipped into crisis by the death of another poet whose work they passionately admire. Thomas Gray Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard was probably inspired by the death of poet Richard West; Shelley poem Adonais is an elegy for Keats. And Auden elegy for Yeats is a touchstone for all poets, reminding us that poetry, the generative lens through which poets see the world, “ makes nothing happen ” . But also that poetry “survives / in the valley of its making ”. Elegy for a friend: In Memoriam by Alfred, Lord Tennyson Poets are often close friends, so categories eight and nine overlap. One recent elegy I find especially poignant is Don Paterson poem Two Trees for his dear friend, poet Michael Donaghy. The great English prototype of elegy for a friend is Milton poem Lycidas : published, like Shelley Adonais , the same year the friend drowned. Tennyson, though, took years to finish his cantos. In Memoriam is a goldmine of deep-felt grief, summing up the centrality of loss to human life: “Better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all . ” Douglas Kennedy top books about grief Elegy for a group: Requiem by Anna Akhmatova translated by Judith Hemschemeyer ( from Complete Poems of Anna Akhmatova ) Elegies for a group are among the most profound poems of all. Death Fugue by German-speaking, Romanian-born Paul Celan is one of his most famous poems but all his work memorialises victims of the Holocaust; as Michael Longley Wounds elegises victims of the Northern Irish Troubles and Thom Gunn collection The Man with Night Sweats addresses Aids-related deaths in the Akhmatova Requiem memorialises the suffering of the Soviet Union under Stalin purges. Refusing to go into exile, she dangerously carried it with her, writing and redrafting it for three decades, in towns across the Soviet Union. “The ones who smiled / Were the dead, glad to be at rest.” Emerald is published by Chatto &amp; Windus, priced It is available from the Guardian bookshop for .",1377,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/18/from-catullus-to-dylan-thomas-the-top-10-elegies
31,"Reading Madame Bovary for the first time was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life - at least up to that point. I was a very young woman - not even eighteen. I was au pair in the French provinces in the and I read Madame Bovary in French, sitting in the furrow of a vineyard. I was like Emma Rouault before she became Madame Bovary, someone whose most intense life was in books, from which I had formed vague images of passion and adventure, love and weddings, marriage and children. I was afraid of being trapped in a house and a kitchen. Madame Bovary opened a vision of meaninglessness and emptiness, which was all the more appalling because it was so full of things, clothes and furniture, rooms and gardens. The worst thing of all was that it was the books that were the most insidious poison. Recently Madame Bovary appeared in a British newspaper listing of the 'fifty best romantic reads.' It was, and is, the least romantic book I have ever read. If I have come to love it , it is because now I am half a century older, and not trapped in a house and kitchen, I can equably sympathise with the central person in the book, who is its author - endlessly inventive, observant, and full of life. Madame Bovary was published in and is at the centre of any discussion of the European realistic novel of bourgeois life - especially provincial life. The nineteenth-century novel, however much it criticises the bourgeoisie, is a bourgeois form that grew up with the prosperous middle classes who had time for reading, and were interested in precise discriminations of social relations and moral and immoral behaviour. It comes after the chivalric epic with its codes of honour and courtly love, and after the religious epic, Paradise Lost, the Divine Comedy, religious dramas of the nature of the human soul in the mythic cosmology. The dense social novel flourished in countries with large cities - London, Paris, St Petersburg, Moscow - in which populations were in a state of rapid change - and provincial societies in which old orders and hierarchies and habits persisted and change was slower. The novel was interested in the structures of societies - from money to education, from religious habits to kinship and marriages, from ambition to failure. Fairy tale images, the hopes of princesses and kitchenmaids, of youngest sons and poor old women, are contained in but also corrected by the realist novel. Fairy stories end with the lovers marrying and living happy ever after. Jane Austen novels keep that pattern. The great realist novels study at length what happens after marriage, within marriages, within families and businesses. One of the great subjects of the realist novel is boredom - narrow experiences in small places and unsympathetic groups. There is no greater study of boredom than Madame Bovary - which is nevertheless never boring, but always both terrifying and simultaneously gleeful over its own accuracy. Madame Bovary is also at the centre of any discussion of literary descriptions of adultery. Denis de Rougemont, in his book, Love in the Western World, observed that 'to judge by literature, adultery would seem to be one of the most remarkable occupations in both Europe and America'. He discussed the great lovers of mediaeval Romance - Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Iseult - and pointed out that the difficulty and unlawfulness of their love is part of the essence of their passion. Marriage is so to speak the social and normal framework of the human story - adultery is the great act of individual self-assertion and longing. In terms of mediaeval Romance which takes place in a world of dynastic marriages and chivalric devotion, such transgressions are doomed and glorious. In terms of bourgeois monogamous society they are different. Engels believed that 'individual sex love' is a recent concern in human societies, and in our modern capitalist monogamous world is more difficult for women than for men - for men are not condemned and ostracised for promiscuity as women are. Anna Karenina and the heroines of Henry James and Edith Wharton suffer for their desires; their souls are battlefields between good and evil, their fates are tragic. The outward events of Emma Bovary life are a petit bourgeois version of the doom of Anna Karenina - with important differences. Both heroines have sexually unappealing husbands, and lives that leave them dissatisfied. Both take lovers and both, in their ways, are betrayed or let down by their lovers. Both are sensual and vulnerable and both commit suicide. It might even be said that both are physically attractive to the men who invented and trapped them in their stories, and that both are punished by their authors, as well as by society. Anna Karenina is tragic almost despite Tolstoy. But if Emma Bovary - who is small-minded and confused and selfish - is tragic, it is not in a romantic way, and not because her readers share her feelings or sympathise with her. Our sympathy for her is like our sympathy for a bird the cat has brought in and maimed. It flutters, and it will die. When Emma Rouault marries Charles Bovary - the fairy tale happy ending - she becomes the third Madame Bovary in the book, after her living mother-in-law and Charles Bovary dead first wife, whose decaying wedding bouquet she finds in her drawer. Her name, and the title of the novel, define her as a person who is expected to behave in certain ways, fitting her station and function. She loses what individual identity she had. She herself has had vague conventional expectations of marriage, and Flaubert wonderfully describes her sexual disappointment, her reluctance to let go of the idea that she is experiencing post-wedding bliss. He also describes her fairytale, women magazine attempts to make her house and clothes conform to an idea she has of decorum and elegance. What makes it impossible for her to inhabit her house or her marriage is her romantic sense that there is something more, some more intense experience, some wider horizon if she could only find it. Her desires are formed by her reading and her education. In the convent where she was educated her dreamy spiritual ecstasies are succeeded by dreamy visions of happiness derived from novels, good and bad. She is like that other archetypal reading hero, Don Quixote, in that her reading habits corrupt her vision of the world and her conduct of her life. They are both Romantics. Don Quixote desires to make provincial La Mancha into a battlefield of giants, demons and ladies in distress. Emma Bovary desires to be happy in lovely clothes in swift carriages, dancing at balls, being admired. The psychoanalyst, Ignès Sodré, wrote an illuminating paper on Madame Bovary, entitled 'Death by Daydreaming' in which she used Freud essay on 'Creative Writers and Daydreaming' to discuss the particular daydreams of Emma Bovary. According to Freud, daydreams are related to children play, in which the toys and objects they arrange are, like 'castles in the air', symbols of what they desire in their lives. Freud interest in this essay is not, he explicitly says, in the great authors of epics and tragedies whose material springs from the myths and history of their world. He is interested precisely in the writers of consoling fantasy tales, minor fictions in which the reader can bathe in narcissistic fantasies of being perfectly brave and beautiful, beloved and successful. Folk tales, Freud says, are the daydreams of a culture. In George Eliot wrote one of the funniest critical essays of her time on 'Silly Novels by Lady Novelists'. In her mock accounts of the heroines of what she calls the 'mind-and-millinery' novel she describes its heroine as surrounded by men who 'play a very subordinate part by her side.' 'Ostensibly the final cause of their existence is that they may accompany the heroine on her tarring' expedition through life. They see her at a ball and are dazzled; at a flower-show, and they are fascinated; on a riding-excursion and they are witched by her noble horsemanship; at church and they are awed by the sweet solemnity of her demeanour. She is the ideal woman in feelings faculties and flounces.' Emma daydreams derive from this pattern. In fact her lovers tire of her and desert her, and it is she who is subordinate. Freud also makes the point that the hero or heroine of the daydream is in a narcissistic solitary world. Emma Bovary romantic desires are little scenes in which she plays the heroine. She prefers to dream about her first lover, Léon, rather than to see him. Her moment of ecstasy after she has been seduced by Rodolphe is when she is able to tell herself in a mirror, 'J'ai un amant. J'ai un amant.' When she decides to set out on the fatal riding expedition with him, it is not desire, let alone love, which propels her - it is Charles Bovary promise of a riding habit, an 'amazone'. 'L'amazone la décida.' She is, as other writers have pointed out, not only a romantic reader, but a bad reader. Flaubert is very precise about the lethal vagueness of her fantasies, as they sap the reality from her world, and simultaneously lay her open to the financial depredations of Lheureux, who sells her the concrete toys - the riding whip and cigar-case - to act out her daydreams. And to destroy the lives of her husband and child. It is not a nice story. So why is it one of the greatest novels of all time? To answer that, it is necessary to look at the history of its writing, and Flaubert ideas about what he was trying to achieve. Flaubert was born in in Rouen, where his father was the chief surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu hospital. His father hoped that Gustave would also be a doctor but the son seems always to have known that he wanted to write. He lived most of his life in Normandy, though he travelled often to Paris and in travelled with his friend Maxime du Camp in Egypt, the Near East and the Mediterranean. He contracted syphilis on this journey, and was also subject to severe epileptic fits. He never married, and lived close to his mother. He had a long, unsatisfactory affair with Louise Colet, eleven years older than he was, and also a writer, who saved his splendid letters. He had himself a Romantic interest in the distant and strange, both in space and in time. In Flaubert finished writing La Tentation de Saint Antoine, inspired by a painting by Brueghel he had seen in Genoa in which depicted the ascetic saint in the desert beset by demons and fleshly temptations. He did a great deal of research on fourth century beliefs, pagan, Christian and heretical, and staged his tale as an exotic drama of ideas. In just before setting out for Egypt with Du Camp, he spent - according to Du Camp - thirty-two hours reading the text aloud to him and his other great friend Louis Bouilhet. Also according to Du Camp, Bouilhet, when Flaubert finally demanded his opinion of the work, said 'I think you should throw it into the fire and never speak of it again.' Flaubert was understandably distressed by this response. In he abandoned various other romantic and exotic projects - Une Nuit de Don Juan, Anubis - and embarked on his novel of provincial life. The immediate inspiration for the plot was the death of a local doctor in Normandy, Eugène Delamare, whose second wife, Delphine, had caused scandal by taking lovers and running up huge debts. But already at the age of sixteen Flaubert had written a tale based on a news story in the Rouen newspapers. He called it Passion et Vertu. Its central character is a woman who poisons her husband and children in order to join her lover in America, and commits suicide when the lover rejects her. Flaubert gave his murderess and suicide romantic tastes as motivation, whereas the original woman seems to have been driven more by money and a desire to evade trial and execution. Flaubert published letters - especially those to Louise Colet about the writing of Madame Bovary - are some of the most fascinating accounts of the writing process that exist. He tells her he is 'two distinct persons: one who is infatuated with bombast, lyricism, eagle flights, sonorities of phrase and lofty ideas; and another who digs and burrows into the truth as deeply as he can, who likes to treat a humble fact as respectfully as a big one, who would like to make you feel almost physically the things he reproduces.' And early in the writing of the novel he says 'The entire value of my book, if it has any, will consist of my having known how to walk straight ahead on a hair, balanced above the two abysses of lyricism and vulgarity (which I want to fuse in a narrative analysis.) When I think of what it can be, I am dazzled.' He wrote also that his new novel would be 'a book about nothing, a book dependent on nothing external, which would be held together by the external strength of its style, just as the earth, suspended in the void, depends on nothing external for its support; a book which would have no subject, or at least in which the subject would be almost invisible, if such a thing is possible.' He was both excited and exhausted by the difficulty of the enterprise - Bovary, he told Louise in July 'will have been an unprecedented tour de force (a fact of which I alone shall ever be aware): its subject, characters, effects etc. - are all alien to me. Writing this book I am like a man playing the piano with lead balls attached to his knuckles.' The supreme importance of style is something to which he returns again and again. He believed he lived in a time when it was not possible to create great types, like Don Quixote or the characters of Shakespeare who 'was not a man, he was a continent; he contained whole crowds of men, entire landscapes. Writers like him do not worry about style: they are powerful in spite of all their faults and because of them. When it comes to us, the little men, our value depends on finished execution.' Flaubert himself is famous for the struggle with every sentence, for the length of time it took him to orchestrate and finish a scene. His style, he wrote, should be 'lisse comme un marbre et furieux comme un tigre' 'chaud en dessous et splendide à la surface.' Prose, he said, should be stuffed with things 'et sans qu'on les aperçoive.' The prose of Madame Bovary depends for many of its most startling effects on its accurate rendering of things. Flaubert told Louise that he wanted to make his reader feel his world 'almost physically' and the emotion and feeling of the novel are embedded in things, from Charles uncouth cap in the first chapter, to Emma delicate presentation of her meals, to her presents to Rodolphe. 'elle trouvait moyen d'offrir un plat coquet, s'entendait a poser sur des feuilles de vigne les pyramides de reines-claudes, servait renversés les pots de confiture dans une assiette, et même elle parlait d'acheter des rince-bouche pour le dessert.' This is an image of Emma making herself an image of domestic finesse and elegance, slightly absurdly beyond the limitations of her, and Charles social situation. Her whole world is imbued with her sensations - we experience her most intensely through them, because she does not think clearly or well in abstract language, but only with images. Occasionally Flaubert choice of comparison carries with it a lyric charge. Here is his description of Emma vision of her garden in winter, when she has become bored and disillusioned. She is seeing a winter world through windows heavily frosted, whose whitish light remained unvaried throughout the day. She goes into the garden 'La rosée avait laissé sur les choux des guipures d'argent avec des longs fils clairs qui s'étendaient de l'un à l'autre. On n'entendait pas d'oiseaux, tout semblait dormir, l'espalier couvert de paille et la vigne comme un grand serpent malade sous le chaperon du mur, où l'on voyait, en s'approchant, se trainer des cloportes a pattes nombreuses.'

32,"even years after the publication of Robinson Crusoe , the great Tory essayist and poet Jonathan Swift – inspired by the Scriblerus club, whose members included John Gay and Alexander Pope – composed a satire on travel narratives that became an immediate bestseller. According to Gay, Gulliver was soon being read “from the cabinet council to the nursery”. In its afterlife as a classic, Gulliver Travels works on many levels. First, it a masterpiece of sustained and savage indignation, “furious, raging, obscene”, according to Thackeray . Swift satirical fury is directed against almost every aspect of early life: science, society, commerce and politics. Second, stripped of Swift dark vision, it becomes a wonderful travel fantasy for children, a perennial favourite that continues to inspire countless versions, in books and films. Finally, as a polemical tour de force, full of wild imagination, it became a source for Voltaire, as well as the inspiration for a Telemann violin suite, Philip K Dick science-fiction story The Prize Ship , and, perhaps most influential of all, George Orwell Animal Farm . Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World by Lemuel Gulliver (to give its original title) comes in four parts, and opens with Gulliver shipwreck on the island of Lilliput, whose inhabitant are just six inches high. The most famous and familiar part of the book (“Lilliputian” soon became part of the language) is a satirical romp in which Swift takes some memorable shots at English political parties and their antics, especially the controversy on the matter of whether boiled eggs should be opened at the big or the little end. Next, Gulliver ship, the Adventure, gets blown off course and he is abandoned on Brobdingnag whose inhabitants are giants with a proportionately gigantic landscape. Here, having been dominant on Lilliput, Gulliver is exhibited as a curious midget, and has a number of local dramas such as fighting giant wasps. He also gets to discuss the condition of Europe with the King, who concludes with Swiftian venom that “the bulk of your natives [are] the most pernicious race of odious little vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.” In the third part of his travels, Gulliver visits the flying island of Laputa (a place-name also referenced in Stanley Kubrick film Dr Strangelove ), and Swift mounts a dark and complicated assault on the speculations of contemporary science (notably spoofing the attempted extraction of sunbeams from cucumbers). Finally, in the section that influenced Orwell ( Gulliver Travels was one of his favourite books), Swift describes the country of the Houyhnhnms, horses with the qualities of rational men. These he contrasts with the loathsome Yahoos, brutes in human shape. Orwell would later echo Swift misanthropy, looking ahead to a time “when the human race had finally been overthrown.” At the end of it all, Gulliver returns home from his travels in a state of alienated wisdom, purged and matured by his experiences. “I write,” he concludes, “for the noblest end, to inform and instruct mankind… I write without any view to profit or praise. I never suffer a word to pass that may possibly give the least offence, even to those who are most ready to take it. So that I hope I may with justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless…” When he died in Swift, remembered as “the gloomy Dean”, was buried in Dublin with the famous epitaph “ubi saeva indignatio ulterius cor lacerare nequit” (where fierce indignation can no further tear apart his heart) inscribed on his tomb. A note on the text: Swift probably started writing Gulliver Travels in (when Crusoe fever was at it height), and delivered the manuscript to the London publisher Benjamin Motte in March The book was published, anonymously, at top speed. Motte, who sensed a bestseller, used several presses to foil any attempt at piracy, and made many cuts to reduce the risk of prosecution. The first edition appeared, in two volumes, on October priced and sold out its first printing in less than a week. In the Irish publisher, George Faulkner printed a collection of Swift works. Volume III became Gulliver Travels , based on a working copy of the original manuscript. The textual history of Gulliver Travels now becomes incredibly complicated, and Swift later disowned most versions, including Motte first edition, saying it was so much altered that “I do hardly know mine own work”. Later scholarly editions of Swift have to choose between Motte and Faulkner, but whatever the version it has never been out of print since the day it first appeared.

33,"ertainly it is valuable to a trained writer to crash in an aircraft that burns,"" Ernest Hemingway told the Paris Review in . ""He learns several important things very quickly."" By the time he made this statement, which seems almost to parody his macho persona, Hemingway long and hugely successful career as a writer was effectively over. He had been in two successive plane crashes in when he had gone on safari to recapture the happiness, and perhaps the inspiration, he experienced on a similar trip to British East Africa in That expedition had inspired the last two major stories he wrote, ""The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber"" and ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"". Their publication in marked the end of a remarkable years in which Hemingway left an indelible mark on the short story. Hemingway earliest published stories are stark formal experiments. In Our Time a book of vignettes often just a paragraph long, describes scenes from the first world war (Hemingway served in the Red Cross in Italy), the Greco-Turkish war, criminal life, and the bullring. They rank with Felix Fénéon elevation of faits-divers to the status of art, but are fired by an even greater intensity through what Edward Said identifies as their ""incredible purity of line and severity of vision"". ""When he was young,"" Frank Kermode notes of Hemingway, ""he worked very hard at never saying anything the way anybody else would say it, and his success was remarkable."" His numerous influences include Chekhov, Sherwood Anderson, Joyce, and his Parisian mentors Pound, Stein, and Ford Madox Ford. He only became derivative later in his career, and then only of his younger self. His next two collections, expanded In Our Time, which interleaved the vignettes between longer stories, and Men Without Women, saw him hone his style to acuteness, producing writing so compressed that, as Frank O'Connor writes, ""[a]t an extreme point it attempts to substitute the image for the reality"". A New Republic review of compared Hemingway prose to cubism, but the more direct comparison is with the powerful ""form as content"" approach Joyce developed in Dubliners. Blended with Hemingway journalism training and the tenets of Pound Imagism, this results in prose that deals with its subject in short, simple sentences mostly comprised of nouns and verbs. Adjectives and adverbs are used sparingly, synonyms are spurned; key words are repeated in patterns to evoke the thing itself, as in the introduction to ""In Another Country"": ""In the fall the war was always there, but we did not go to it any more. It was cold in the fall in Milan and the dark came very early. Then the electric lights came on, and it was pleasant along the streets looking in the windows. There was much game hanging outside the shops, and snow powdered the fur of the foxes and the wind blew their tails. The deer hung stiff and heavy and empty, and small birds flew in the wind and the wind turned their feathers. It was a cold fall and the wind came down from the mountains."" The sense of ""cold fall"" permeates, dominating the paragraph beginning and end, while the repetition of ""wind"" is remorseless; it whips around you as you read. Amid this concrete description, the detail of the dead deer hanging ""empty"" is particularly resonant. This ascetic style material effect is that the stories' meaning often lies hidden deep within the words, or even in the spaces between them. Joseph M Flora has said that ""deciphering nuance quickly becomes the primary challenge to [Hemingway] readers"". Hemingway most powerful stories are masterpieces of implication, ""conveying,"" HE Bates wrote, ""emotion and atmosphere without drawing up a tidy balance sheet of descriptions about them"". Consider ""Big Two-Hearted River"", outwardly a methodical description of a trout-fishing trip during which absolutely nothing unusual happens. Nick Adams (an autobiographical character who appears in two dozen Hemingway stories) camps, fishes, and considers then decides against fishing a nearby swamp. Yet despite this calm surface it is, as Italo Calvino describes, ""a very depressing tale, with a sense of oppression... of vague anguish besetting [Nick] on all sides"". The concrete reality of the story is subtly shown to be a slender bridge spanning dark torrents. Charles May describes this story as ""the best example of Hemingway transformation of ordinary everyday objects and events into projections of psychic distress"". Nick has returned from the war psychologically damaged and is attempting to rehabilitate, but none of this is mentioned. This omission follows what Hemingway calls the ""iceberg principle"", which many lesser writers have foundered on. ""A writer who omits things because he does not know them,"" Hemingway writes, ""only makes hollow places in his writing"". In his stories these lacunae are pregnant absences where raw emotion lies encoded. They are almost all there is to what many regard the quintessential Hemingway story, ""Hills Like White Elephants"", in which an abortion is discussed but never explicitly mentioned. The couple desultory conversation swarms with unarticulated meanings. Taken as a whole, Hemingway fiction portrays a brutal world dominated by conflict and surrounded by nothingness: the ""nada y pues nada y nada y pues nada"" the waiter recites in ""A Clean, Well-Lighted Place"". In that story, however, we see an example of the ""Hemingway code"", in which the arbitrary violence and meaninglessness of life is met with dignity, which in turn confers meaning. This battle informs ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"" Although for me one of his less successful stories (like Calvino, "" I cannot take 'lyricism' in Hemingway ""), it nevertheless contains individual passages that rank alongside nearly anything else in his oeuvre. Some of the dying writer memories are as sharply evocative as the early vignettes, while his description of the ""sudden evil-smelling emptiness"" of death is as compelling as Tolstoy ""black sack"" in ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"". It fashionable to knock Hemingway, but risible as certain aspects of his life and work may be, the influence of his best writing seems to be underestimated not because of its lack of relevance, but its ubiquity. You don't have to look hard to find a short-story writer influenced by Carver, for example, and to be influenced by Carver is to be influenced by Hemingway, whether consciously or not. Taste is subjective, but the literary impact of Hemingway spare, complex stories is measurable and profound.

34,"Today in the centenary of his birth, there is no shortage of interested parties eager to claim George Orwell as one of their own. Though renowned for following his own path and making his opinions as clear as polished glass, he has nonetheless been adopted by just about every political colour in the spectrum, from revolutionary red to Little-England blue, from hard-core Trotskyites to gung-ho neoconservatives, from utopian anarchists to old-fashioned High Tories. His gaunt, forlornly knowing features have become, as it were, the acceptable face of radicalism. The process by which Orwell has been remoulded into a fits-all-sizes paragon is long and twisted, and not without interest (indeed there are whole bookcases of literature on the subject). But before he became a secular saint he was, first and to the last, a writer. And if it is not too clingingly possessive to mention, he was a writer for The Observer. He was also, of course, a writer for many other publications. Orwell was almost as promiscuous as he was prodigious in his freelance journalism. It also fair to say that his output for The Observer, while often first-rate, features few of the works on which his formidable reputation as a non-fiction writer rests. His celebrated 'As I Please' column, for example, was written for Tribune. His gentle but sharply observed meditations on English life - how to brew the perfect cup of tea and what constitutes the ideal pub - were published by the Evening Standard. And the groundbreaking forays into popular culture - his examinations of the British seaside postcard and boys' comics - and the revered polemical essays appeared in periodicals such as Horizon and Polemic. Even so, the mark he left on this newspaper was arguably far more profound than his legacy elsewhere in Fleet and Grub streets, and not just because Horizon and Polemic quickly folded. What was different about The Observer is that Orwell theory of journalistic writing - succinct, provocative, transparent - was designated the house style to which all the newspaper writers were expected to aspire during its 'golden age' of the Fifties. As early as The Observer had called Orwell 'a great writer' in its review of Homage to Catalonia, his account of his experience fighting for the Republicans in the Spanish civil war. This was by no means a universally shared judgment, as was shown by the fact that the book - now recognised as a genre-defining classic - sold a paltry copies. It was not until late though, that Orwell was asked to write for The Observer. At the time, the paper was edited by JL Garvin, a staunch Churchillian Tory, but it was owned by the Astor family. And it was Lord Astor son, David Astor who first approached Orwell, following a recommendation by Cyril Connolly. Astor knew Orwell only by his patriotic call to arms, The Lion and The Unicorn, but already admired his clarity of thought. For two old Etonians, their social backgrounds could hardly have been more contrasting. Orwell (né Eric Blair) was born in Bengal, the son of an official in the Indian Civil Service. He joined the imperial police force in Burma before taking up writing and tramping and writing about tramping. Astor was a scion of a multi-millionaire Anglo-American family. His mother, Nancy, was the first woman to sit in the House of Commons. Their country seat, Cliveden, was the scene of the kind of Edwardian lavishness that, were it not for Merchant and Ivory, would tax the modern imagination. Orwell wanted an end to the class system and economic inequality. Astor was a patrician liberal. Yet the two hit it off immediately. Astor often slept at Orwell Belsize Park flat during the blackout and, like a pair of overgrown students (Orwell never went to university and Astor dropped out of Oxford), the two would stay up discussing politics and the war. The conversations had a lasting influence on Astor. As Richard Cockett notes in his David Astor and The Observer, Orwell was 'the man who more than any other... helped to shape the new Observer'. All the same, as much as Orwell warmed to Astor, it did not prevent him questioning his motives. When the younger man told him about the fiasco of the Allied raid on Dieppe and concluded that it was impossible to invade Europe, Orwell noted in his diary: 'Of course, we can't be sure he wasn't planted to say this, considering who his parents are.' One of Orwell preoccupations throughout this period was Indian independence, a cause that was widely ignored during wartime, not least because the Japanese were calling for the British to leave India. It was also the subject of his first, unsigned, contribution to The Observer on February under the title 'India Next'. It was not the most auspicious of beginnings, but it did point to a change of direction in the paper. For one thing, it was very likely the paper first anti-colonial piece and, for another, many more were to follow. Shortly after, Garvin was replaced by Ivor Brown, although the real driving force was now Astor - who, curiously enough, was actually employed as an officer in the Royal Marines. Orwell was himself working for the BBC in the Indian section of the Overseas Service. His superiors were less than enthusiastic about his moonlighting and, in return, Orwell resented what he saw as the corporation bureaucracy and censorship. He had also grown disillusioned with his own role as a propagandist, his contorted attempt to distinguish between 'honest' and 'dishonest' propaganda evidently having failed. He resigned in September At that point, as Gordon Bowker writes in his vivid new biography (George Orwell, Little Brown), 'there was some talk of him joining The Observer full-time, but to David Astor relief, this idea came to nothing. After the war Astor became the paper editor and the worst thing he could have imagined, he said, was having to reject anything written by Orwell.' Instead Orwell became Tribune literary editor and a fortnightly book reviewer for The Observer. Even so, there was a series of attempts to send him abroad as a reporter. Early in The Observer had asked him to be a war correspondent in North Africa. But Orwell failed the medical and soon after succumbed to a bronchitis attack that left him bed-ridden for three weeks. Perhaps at this juncture we should pause to consider his position. He was about to turn save among a few intellectuals, he was unknown; he had enjoyed next to no success as a novelist and his work as a journalist, while respected, had brought little material reward; he was married and desperate for a child (he believed himself to be infertile); he carried a bullet-wound in his neck from his time fighting in Spain; and he was chronically sick. He had seven years left to live, a good deal of them spent ill in bed or hospital, and all of them under the shadow of war and its austere aftermath. Yet the two novels that would make him famous throughout the world, and much of his finest journalism, were yet to be written. Two years later The Observer succeeded in gaining Orwell services as a war reporter. How the paper achieved this, given the state of the writer health, is not known, but Bowker is not alone in speculating that Astor used his contacts to circumvent a medical. Orwell was stationed in Paris at the well-named Hotel Scribe. Also present were Malcolm Muggeridge and AJ Ayer, both working for British intelligence, and Harold Acton, the dandyish aesthete whom Orwell knew from Eton. Muggeridge introduced Orwell to PG Wodehouse, under house arrest for suspected collusion with the Nazis, which led him to write 'In Defence of PG Wodehouse', again an argument that was a long way from fashionable. He also met Hemingway, from whom, according to the American, he requested a gun. Orwell had worried about being the target of a Stalinist hit ever since his experiences at the hands of Soviet agents in Barcelona. Continual intellectual attacks by Soviet sympathisers, not to mention the assassination of Trotsky, had done nothing to ease his paranoia. Apparently Hemingway lent him a Colt pistol. Orwell narrowly missed meeting Albert Camus when the Frenchman had to pull out of a rendezvous at the Deux Magots café due to illness. The two authors admired one another work, and that was not all they had in common. Like Orwell, Camus was tubercular and, also like the Englishman, he would die (albeit in a car crash) at The Observer of March ran an Orwell piece filed from Germany entitled 'Creating Order Out Of Cologne Slum'. Two weeks later he followed it up with an article about the 'Future Of A Ruined Germany'. In between his wife, Eileen, died in hospital in London during a routine operation to remove a growth in her womb. The previous summer they had adopted a baby boy, Richard. It was the child dreadful destiny to lose two sets of parents before he was seven. (In the event, he was brought up by Orwell sister Avril, and became a farmer, as Orwell had once hoped he would in a letter to a friend.) Eileen wrote to her husband before the operation detailing her joy at Richard and her despair at living in London. She looked forward to a life beyond the decrepit confines of the capital. By all accounts, Orwell was not the most attentive of husbands, and was prone to affairs, but it seems that he had grown closer to his wife after Richard adoption. The crushing sense of loss he must have experienced was reflected in the devastated landscape he encountered on his return to continental Europe following Eileen funeral. 'To walk through the ruined cities of Germany,' he wrote in The Observer on April, 'is to feel an actual doubt about the continuity of civilisation.' In all he filed dispatches from the Continent. Most were written from Paris, but he also travelled to Nuremberg, Stuttgart - where he eloquently described the looting that followed its collapse - and Austria. Taken together, these pieces read not as straightforward reporting, nor even reportage, but more like a sober summary of events that were too large, and too chaotic, to summarise. He had wanted to witness the remnants of a totalitarian regime and found, instead, a defeated people much like any other. Astor did not think reporting was Orwell strongest suit. In the circumstances the singular achievement was not what he wrote but that he wrote. As Orwell acknowledged, Eileen, a former student of Tolkien, had played an influential role in helping to plan a short novel he had completed in the summer of It was one of many sadnesses that the woman who believed so unshakably in her husband was not alive to witness the publication of Animal Farm in August and the overdue recognition it would bring. The book, a brilliantly simple satire on the Russian Revolution, was initially turned down by several publishers, fearful of offending Britain Soviet allies. At that time, and right up until and even beyond, the majority of this country left-wing intelligentsia was engaged full-time in closing its eyes to the reality of life in the Soviet Union. The enemy, as far as they were concerned, was fascism. Orwell, to his undying credit, realised that the enemy was totalitarianism in its totality. While Orwell critics comfortably outnumbered his supporters during his lifetime, the ratio is now reversed. But that is not to say there aren't still plenty of critics. They tend to divide into two groups: those who say he failed because he old out' the revolutionary cause, and those who say he failed because he would not give it up. From the latter group, Louis Menand, recently writing in the New Yorker, played down Orwell consistent opposition to imperialism, fascism and Stalinism. 'The important question, after condemning those things, was what to do about them, and how to understand the implications for the future. On this level, Orwell was almost always wrong.' It true that his predictions were frequently way off the mark, as he himself admitted. But to read Orwell as some kind of twentieth-century political Nostradamus is to miss the power of his message. He was a dissenter, not a strategist, much less a prophet. He may often have been wrong about getting it right, but in the crucial matters he was right about what was wrong. And sometimes, if properly articulated, that is enough. Animal Farm was one such case. It portrayed in words a child could understand what so many adults had refused to comprehend: the inevitable corruption of a revolution that is controlled from the top. With the publication of Animal Farm Orwell resigned as literary editor of Tribune, although he continued to write the 'As I Please' column for another two years. Astor, whose family owned land on Jura, recommended the Hebridean isle for a holiday. Orwell was so taken with the place that he rented a farmhouse called Barnhill on the northern tip of the island for the summer. In the wake of the bombing of Hiroshima, the remote island must have seemed like a prelapsarian retreat from the horrors of modernity. But you would have to spend a long time scouring the British Isles to find a more hostile environment for a man with TB. There was no electricity, the rain scarcely ceased, and the house was miles from the nearest doctor. It might be stretching the point to say that Orwell was a masochist (at least one woman he knew said he was a sadist), but his attitude to his health was wilfully reckless. The correspondence between Orwell and Astor intensified. Barnhill had no phone and was two days of gruelling travel from London, so there was little choice. Orwell letters were bucolic - lots of stuff about horses, flowers and fishing - but the references to the house suggest that partan' may be too generous a description. 'I still haven't got the hot water running,' he informs Astor. And later: 'Do come across if you're ever at Tarbert. There plenty of room here, tho still a bit rough (eg, no sheets on the beds!).' In April Horizon published 'Politics and the English Language', Orwell meditation on how to write what you mean and mean what you write. For years afterwards, Astor circulated the piece to every journalist who joined the paper. Ironically, it is not one of the crystalline essayist clearest efforts. He never quite succeeds in making his case that dishonest politics leads to poor English and that, in turn, poor English leads to even less honest politics. The set of rules he recommends are hit and miss, and his examples of good and bad English often appear to be based on nothing more solid than his own preferences (short words) and prejudices (foreign words). However, within the broad confusion and conflation of his arguments, there are paragraphs and sections that are so exquisitely precise that it is almost impossible to read them without wishing to write better. For example: 'The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one real and one declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink.' These were no doubt just the cautionary words that the confident young group of Oxbridge graduates Astor was assembling needed to hear. During the war, the heart, or more accurately the brain, of the newspaper was made up of brilliant émigrés such as Isaac Deutscher, Sebastian Haffner and Jon Kimche. Now Astor turned his attention to a new generation of homegrown writers for whom, in VS Pritchett memorable phrase, Orwell would perform the role of 'wintry conscience'. Between the end of the war and the mid-Fifties an exceptional group of young journalists, among them Patrick O'Donovan and Kenneth Tynan, joined the paper. To the moral seriousness established by Orwell and others, they added a crisp wit and a panache welcomed by a country emerging from some stark and difficult years. Between when Astor first became involved, and when The Observer overtook the Sunday Times, the circulation went from under to more than Orwell maintained a close interest in upcoming talent. As late as he answered Astor inquiry about employing one wayward writer. 'I think Philip Toynbee is a good idea. I don't know him well, but he seems to me to be quite gifted and politically OK.' Toynbee went on to become The Observer leading book reviewer. Orwell was himself a master of the form. He always got straight to the core of a book argument and if he found it wanting he could be as brutal with his friends as his enemies. One Observer review of a book by HG Wells, his one-time dinner host, was so savage that the old man never spoke to him again. Few contemporary appraisals of seminal works manage to stay the distance, but, years on, his reviews, for instance, of Hayek The Road to Serfdom and Eliot Notes towards the Definition of Culture stand up as well, if not better, than the books themselves. The latter, written in his sick bed in November was one of Orwell last pieces for The Observer. Often misunderstood as a voice of doom, he roused himself against Eliot pessimism (which, under the circumstances, he had every right not to) and concluded: 'Before writing off our own age as irrevocably damned, is it not worth remembering that Matthew Arnold and Swift and Shakespeare - to carry the stock back only three centuries - were all equally certain that they lived in a period of decline?' The sick bed was in Jura. What was he doing there in November? He had already been hospitalised earlier in the year with TB, just when The Observer ludicrously hoped to send him to cover the South African elections. On that occasion Astor had been able to arrange the importation of streptomycin, a TB wonder drug available only in the US, to help treat Orwell. Now he was about to return to hospital for the final time. The previous winter had been harsh and there was a severe fuel shortage. Even armed with his royalty cheques from Animal Farm, he was still reduced to burning his son toys to heat their leaking London flat. 'I think it will be easier to keep warm here,' he wrote to Astor from Jura, 'as we are better off for coal etc.' It hard to decide from that sentence which was most helpless - post-war Britain or Orwell himself. He had also returned to Jura to finish Nineteen Eighty-Four. It was his last and most powerful warning against allowing truth to become the ruthless monopoly of the state. Read today, it may seem like a dated piece of futurism. But that only from the perspective of a society that has had the benefit of its wisdom. If a translated copy fell into the hands of a North Korean, it would probably seem like a work of pure naturalism written this morning. The effort to complete it surely killed Orwell, who was forced to type the manuscript himself; his publisher, Alfred Secker, having failed to arrange a stenographer. Orwell knew that his time was up. When he was told by Astor, on publication of the novel, that The Observer was making him the subject of its profile, he wrote back that perhaps it ought be refashioned as an obituary. This time the streptomycin was of no use (had he lived for another few months, a new drug might have saved him). He married Sonia Bronwell, a young editor at Horizon, on October He was looking for a widow, a literary executor, and Bronwell agreed after several other women had turned him down. Astor sorted out the licence required for a marriage in hospital. He was also best man. On January the bridegroom died. Again, Astor took care of arrangements. Orwell, the atheist, had requested that he be buried according to the rites of the Church of England. Astor found a plot in the churchyard in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire. It was only right that at the end the editor of The Observer watched over Orwell, for the writer, even if he was not aware of it, had watched inspirationally over The Observer. Half a century on, Big Brother is not watching us, but let us hope that at this newspaper George Orwell continues to for many years to come.",3465,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/11/georgeorwell.classics
35,"ritish national self-confidence boomed throughout the century, with that familiar mix of pride and insecurity. Now, more than ever, the educated English reader needed a dictionary. In the new world of global trade and global warfare, a language that was becoming seeded throughout the first British empire required an authoritative act of definition by a vigorous and practical champion. Enter Dr Johnson. Samuel Johnson , born in Lichfield in was a pioneer who raised common sense to heights of genius, and a man of robust popular instincts whose watchwords were clarity, precision and simplicity. The Johnson who challenged Bishop Berkeley solipsist theory of the nonexistence of matter by kicking a large stone (“I refute it thus”) is the same Johnson for whom language must have a daily practical use, and a ready application to the everyday world of the common man. The would-be lexicographer signed the contract for his Dictionary with the bookseller Robert Dodsley at a breakfast held at the Golden Anchor in Holborn on June He was to be paid in instalments, and from this he took money to rent Gough Square in which he set up his “dictionary workshop”. James Boswell ( No in this series ) described the garret where Johnson worked as “fitted up like a counting house” with a long desk at which his clerks could work standing up. Johnson himself was stationed on a rickety chair surrounded by a chaos of borrowed books. He was helped by six assistants (five of them Scots, one an expert in “low cant phrases”). Despite his formidable reputation as a man of letters, there was something rather childish about Johnson. In his awkward, ungainly walk and unkempt appearance, he was like an overgrown boy. It is said that he loved to climb trees and roll down grassy hills. Fanny Burney ( No in this series ), who knew him well, once wrote that “His body is in continual agitation, see-sawing up and down; his feet are never a moment quiet; and, in short, his whole person is in perpetual motion.” Overshadowing his disconcerting exuberance was a chronic depression, reminiscent of Churchill “black dog”, a sometimes disabling despair. He told Boswell that Robert Burton The Anatomy of Melancholy was “the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise”. Out of this troubled psychology, masking a profound inner torment, Johnson found solace in a language that was, in its coarse complexity and comprehensive genius, the precise analogue of his character. No surprise, then, that the Dictionary would occupy almost a decade of his career. The work was immense. Writing in some large notebooks (and without a library to hand), Johnson wrote the definitions of more than words, illustrating their many meanings with about quotations drawn from English writing on every subject, on food, philosophy, fashion and frivolity, from Shakespeare and the Elizabethans, via Milton, to his own time. He did not, he admitted, expect to achieve complete originality. Working to a deadline, essentially on his own, he had to draw on the best of all previous dictionaries, making his work a heroic synthesis. In fact, it was very much more. Unlike his predecessors, Johnson treated English very practically, as a living language, with many different shades of meaning. He adopted his definitions on the principle of English common law – according to precedent. With the Dictionary , the author and his subject achieved a remarkable, unfettered unanimity. Both were adaptable, populist and instinctively subversive (or, to put it another way, libertarian). As a result, in the decades after its publication, the Dictionary was not seriously rivalled until the coming of The Oxford English Dictionary by which time some of Johnson definitions had passed into folklore: Lexicographer: A writer of dictionaries, a harmless drudge… Oats: A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people. Whigs: The name of a faction. The distinctive wit of the Dictionary and its definitions has obscured its remarkable grace and clarity: Heart: The muscle which by its contraction and dilation propels the blood through the course of circulation … It is supposed in popular language to be the seat sometimes of courage, sometimes of affection. Johnson definitions for a simple, but tricky, word like Thought display the fluency and accuracy of an exceptional intelligence: The operation of the mind; the act of thinking. Idea; image formed in the mind. Sentiment; fancy; imagery; conceit. Reflection; particular consideration. Conception; preconceived notion. Opinion; judgement. Meditation; serious consideration. Design; purpose. Silent contemplation. Solicitude; care; concern. Expectation. A small degree; a small quantity. For all its eccentricity, this two-volume work is a masterpiece and a landmark, in Johnson own words, “setting the orthography, displaying the analogy, regulating the structures, and ascertaining the significations of English words”. It was an achievement that, in Boswell words, “conferred stability on the language of his country”, a stability that would be invaluable in the decades to come. However, though it made Johnson famous and well esteemed, the Dictionary did not allay his incessant money troubles. By Johnson was so hard up that he was forced to dash off the potboiling fable Rasselas to pay, he said, for his mother funeral. A signature sentence “When I took the first survey of my undertaking, I found our speech copious without order, and energetic without rules: wherever I turned my view, there was perplexity to be disentangled and confusion to be regulated; choice was to be made out of boundless variety, without any established principle of selection; adulterations were to be detected, without a settled test of purity; and modes of expression to be rejected or received, without the suffrages of any writers of classical reputation or acknowledged authority.” (From the Preface to A Dictionary of the English Language ) Three to compare James Boswell: The Life of Samuel Johnson LL D Noah Webster: An American Dictionary of the English Language James Murray (ed): The Oxford English Dictionary",997,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/25/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-86-a-dictionary-of-the-english-language-by-samuel-johnson-1755
36,"The most celebrated history book in the English language has its own famous founding myth: “It was at Rome, on the of October as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were singing Vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the City first started to my mind.” Edward Gibbon almost certainly contrived this fanciful recollection, but the scholarship that went into his Decline and Fall still stands, like a timeless Roman ruin: majestic, elegant and even sublime. An object of awe, Gibbon history unfolds its narrative from the height of the Roman empire to the fall of Byzantium. The six volumes (published between and fall into three parts: from the age of Trajan to “the subversion of the western empire” in AD; from the reign of Justinian in the east to the second, Germanic empire, under Charlemagne, in the west; and from the revival of this western empire to the fall of Constantinople in In so doing, Gibbon traces the intimate and profound connection of the ancient world to his own, more modern time, linking more or less explicitly the age of the Enlightenment to the age of Rome. Gibbon may have been an amateur historian (his life was otherwise devoted to nurturing his family considerable wealth, and to serving in the militia), but his erudition is staggering. It was commonplace in Augustan England of the century to refer to Virgil, Ovid, or Plutarch. Gibbon alludes to passages in Strabo, Sallust, Seneca, Macrobius and Longinus, among many others. Next to his learning, there his style, whose later devotees include both Winston Churchill, ( No in this series), and Evelyn Waugh. “It has always been my practice,” wrote Gibbon, “to cast a long paragraph in a single mould, to try it by my ear, to deposit it in my memory; but to suspend the action of the pen till I had given the last polish to my work.” Decline and Fall is a cathedral of words and opinions: sonorous, awe-inspiring and shadowy, with odd and unexpected corners of wit and irony, concealed in well-judged footnotes. For example, in chapter VII on Gordian, he writes: Twenty-two acknowledged concubines, and a library of volumes attested the variety of his inclinations, and from the productions which he left behind him, it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than ostentation. His footnote provides a witty coda: “By each of his concubines, the younger Gordian left three or four children. His literary productions were by no means contemptible.” He was also happy to disavow any consequence to this immense undertaking: “History is, indeed, little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortune of mankind.” Gibbon also liked to season his narrative with pithy asides. For example: “Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius.” And again, in chapter VIII: “All taxes must, at last, fall upon agriculture.” Sometimes, Gibbon is almost the equal of Tacitus in his brutal summaries of the historical process: “Corruption, the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty.” And then there his intellectual background, as a scholar steeped in the age of reason. Gibbon famously blamed Christianity for the disintegration of the Roman empire: “As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal that the introduction, or at least the abuse, of Christianity had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and the soldiers’ pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. Faith, zeal, curiosity, and more Earthly passions of malice and ambition kindled the flame of theological discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country.” However, here and there, as in his account of Constantine conversion, he grudgingly allows for the benefits of religion, too: “The sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser motives, the standard of the republic. Religious precepts are easily obeyed which indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the barbarian proselytes of the North. If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.” After several rewrites, with Gibbon “often tempted to throw away the labours of seven years”, the first volume of his Decline and Fall was published on February less than six months before the US declaration of independence, a famous climax to the revolution in the American colonies, and a more than passing coincidence. Two months after the first publication of the first volume of this colossal classic, Gibbon boasted to his stepmother about his work reception: “It has been very well received, by men of letters, men of the world, and even by fine feathered ladies.” It is, in other words, a work of universal interest, and timeless influence, unquestionably a magnificent classic of our literature. Gibbon own farewell to his masterpiece is almost more affecting than his celebrated account of its genesis: “It was on the day, or rather the night, of June between the hours of and that I wrote the last lines of the last page in a summer-house in my garden... I will not dissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom, and perhaps the establishment of my fame. But my pride was soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind by the idea that I had taken my everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion, and that, whatsoever might be the future date of my history, the life of the historian must be short and precarious.” A signature sentence “The strength of the frontiers, which had always consisted in arms rather than fortifications, was insensibly undermined; and the fairest provinces were left exposed to the rapaciousness or ambition of the barbarians, who soon discovered the decline of the Roman empire.” Three to compare Edward Gibbon, Memoirs of My Life and Writings Winston Churchill, A History of the English-speaking Peoples David Womerseley, The Transformation of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon is available from Penguin Classics in three volumes, along with an abridged edition To order the latter for go to guardianbookshop.com or call Free UK p&amp;p over online orders only.

37,"alph Waldo Emerson burst on to the American literary scene in the autumn of as the protege of Thomas Carlyle, under whose spell he had fallen during a visit to England in On his return to America, duly inspired, the Emerson embarked on a brilliant career as an acclaimed public lecturer, a programme of self-enlightenment through which he would evolve his post-Romantic and quasi-religious idea of transcendentalism. This ecstatic concept, typical of the American mind at its more fervent and mystical, was first expressed in a lecture entitled Nature that Emerson gave at Harvard on November in which he articulated his belief that “Nature is the symbol of spirit”. This, according to the critic Jay Parini, would influence “generations of poets and nature writers” for whom this call to arms became “a major source of ideas”. “Nature,” Emerson declared, in a self-conscious echo of the Romantic ideal, “is the incarnation of thought.” He added, with thrilling opacity, that “The world is the mind precipitated.” In explication of these mysteries, he argued that to experience the “wholeness” with nature for which we are naturally suited, we must be separate from the quotidian distractions imposed by society. For Emerson, it was “solitude” that would be the singular mechanism through which the questing individual might become fully engaged in the world of nature. He instructed, in words which soon resonated among an emerging generation of Americans: “To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars.” When a person experiences true solitude, in nature, it “takes him away”, elevating him to a new level of consciousness. Society, Emerson said, destroys wholeness, whereas “Nature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the process and the result. All the parts incessantly work into each other hands for the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapour to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man.” From this kind of exalted secular piety, it a short step to Emerson definition of a spiritual relationship with nature through which the individual can discover the “spirit of nature”, and accept it as the Universal Being: “Nature is not fixed but fluid; to a pure spirit, nature is everything.” Like all the great American intellectual salesmen, Emerson was intent on establishing himself as the chief explicator of nature special language – a unique means of communication, offered exclusively to his followers: “Nature is a language and every new fact one learns is a new word; but it is not a language taken to pieces and dead in the dictionary, but the language put together into a most significant and universal sense. I wish to learn this language, not that I may know a new grammar, but that I may read the great book that is written in that tongue.” Some of Emerson is a passionate American frontier howl which, strangely, can also morph into unvarnished Trumpism This was heady stuff in straitlaced, post-revolutionary New England. Other invitations followed and on August now speaking within the precincts of Harvard, Emerson gave his now-famous Phi Beta Kappa “Oration”, which would become known as The American Scholar, described by Oliver Wendell Holmes as America “intellectual declaration of independence”. After this, Emerson never looked back. He became the Sage of Concord, Massachusetts whose Essays approached the status of holy writ. The first volume of these was published in its influence would reverberate down the remaining decades of the century. Subsequently, Emerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical tenets, but developing ideas popular in America, ideas such as individuality and freedom, mankind ability to fulfil itself through individual endeavour. Emerson is one of several figures who adopted a pantheist approach to existence by rejecting any religious faith that separated God from the world. His Nature was fairly abstract: “Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul.” Emerson high-flown articulation of “America first”, expressed in sentences such as “We have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe”, struck a powerful chord with impressionable and idealistic young men like Henry David Thoreau. His Walden ( No in this series ) is directly descended from Emerson Essays , especially those that addressed quasi-existential questions such as friendship, heroism, art and, in a popular restatement of his Phi Beta Kappa speech, the all-American question of self-reliance, a rhetorical paean that has a strange, almost surreal, topicality in the spring of “Nothing at last is sacred,” declares Emerson, “but the integrity of your own mind…” He had already elaborated what he means by this: “To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men – that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost – and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment.” Some of Emerson, stripped of its high-mindedness, is a passionate American frontier howl which, strangely, can also morph into unvarnished Trumpism: “No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong what is against it… The doctrine of hatred must be preached as the counteraction of the doctrine of love when that pules and whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the doorpost, Whim .” “A foolish consistency,” Emerson remarks soon after this, “is the hobgoblin of little minds.” Emerson, one of the most influential writers in the United States during the century, is central to American Romanticism. His essays and lectures had a profound influence on the thinkers, writers and poets who came after him. Once, when asked to sum up his work, he said he believed in the “infinitude” of the private individual. Emerson is also renowned as a mentor and friend of Henry David Thoreau whose Walden owes him a deep debt. A signature sentence “There is a time in every man education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till.” Three to compare Henry David Thoreau: Walden Dale Carnegie: How to Win Friends and Influence People Robert Macfarlane: The Wild Places Nature and Selected Essays is available in Penguin Classics To order a copy for go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call Free UK p&amp;p over online orders only.

38,"If God Spare My Life: William Tyndale, the English Bible and Sir Thomas More - A Story of Martyrdom and Betrayal by Brian Moynahan Little, Brown, Most people from the past before film and sound recording are now no more than bundles of words: we read what is written about them, or fragments of what they wrote or said themselves. If we are lucky, we also have some idea of how they looked. Not so with William Tyndale: his one portrait was painted by someone who never met him. It is simply a symbolic image, like a medieval saint, proclaiming him the first English Puritan and the embodiment of the English Reformation, grave, bearded, black-clad, self-contained. Yet we are compensated for this facelessness by Tyndale pioneering English translations of the Bible. Unbidden and without a name attached to them, his words rise to our tongues - ""eat, drink and be merry"", ""the salt of the earth"", ""the powers that be"". In Tyndale time, English was not a significant language outside the self-important little kingdom of Henry VIII, but accidents of history have made Tyndale into a major cultural force on the planet. Together with Thomas Cranmer, the compiler of the Prayer Book, and William Shakespeare, Tyndale has shaped a language now tapped into computer keyboards from Tokyo to Tierra del Fuego. Brian Moynahan presents him in a convincing and lively pen-portrait that is fully sensitive to the achievement of the Bible translator who sacrificed his life for words. Of course, Tyndale did not set out to become a cultural icon. He valued English because his own countrymen could come to the Word of God in their own language, rather than relying on clergy to select fragments of the Bible for translating from Latin, to suit their own purposes. Everyone must find God good news of salvation for themselves. So Tyndale painfully learned Greek and Hebrew, the latter while he was also learning German and Dutch in order to survive when he was on the run from England, so that he could translate the Word of God for the English. Many from the old church wanted him dead, chiefly the enigmatic genius Thomas More: the two men brought out the worst in each other, turning their language skills to cheap abuse and fruitless argument. Pope John Paul II has now declared More the patron saint of politicians, which is good news for politicians who want to burn people at the stake. Tyndale could never be the patron saint of politicians: he had no political sense. He alternately delighted and infuriated Henry VIII by telling him to become head of the church, and then telling him to stick to Queen Catherine of Aragon and not marry Anne Boleyn. In the end, Henry did nothing when the Holy Roman Emperor arrested the exile - leaving Tyndale to rot in a prison near Antwerp until the Emperor chose to order his execution by strangulation and burning. Only a year or two later, Henry authorised a completed version of Tyndale Bible to be placed in every church in his realm. Tyndale, in a decade of public life, achieved more than any politician of his age, and made the future of mainstream English culture a Protestant future for four centuries. More remains to be presented of Tyndale life than there is in Moynahan biography, or in another recent work by David Daniell, William Tyndale. Moynahan notes only in passing that Andrew J Brown has disposed of previous assertions that Tyndale came from the soft pastoral landscape of the Vale of Gloucester. In fact, the translator was from that independent-minded and fiercely self-contained home of Lollards, the Forest of Dean - as John Foxe had told us in his life of Tyndale, ""on the borders of Wales"". Was it the sound of a bafflingly different language in the marketplace at Chepstow or St Briavels that made the boy so fascinated by translation? Tyndale always showed a lively awareness of the difference of the Celtic lands. Moynahan can be forgiven for not knowing the yet-unpublished work of Dr Magnus Williamson, which startlingly places a priest called William Tyndale as a chaplain of the Lady Guild in the wealthy Lincolnshire parish church of Boston in - just at a blank spot in the translator career. For Tyndale to be a chantry priest in Boston is not as bizarre as it sounds: the town under the shadow of the Boston Stump was an early hive of religious radicalism, and two of the other major players in Tyndale story, Thomas Cromwell and Thomas Cranmer, were intimately linked with this little port, which was a perfect place for smuggling illicit literature from abroad. The life of Tyndale has surprises in store for us still. Yet Moynahan writes with the passion and style of a veteran journalist in love with his subject. Various slips in his narrative are not significant, and this book is a fine introduction to Tyndale. It might be useful bedtime reading for a pope. · Diarmaid MacCulloch is fellow of St Cross College and professor of the history of the church, Oxford University.",854,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/01/featuresreviews.guardianreview6
39,"Merlin Holland is Oscar Wilde grandson and the sole executor of his estate. He is the author of Irish Peacock &amp; Scarlet Marquess, the first unabridged publication of the famous libel trial. 'Oscar' is the best-known 'Wilde' True, but unfairly so. His father, Sir William, was a remarkable Dublin doctor whose medical work on the and censuses earned him his knighthood, and is still referred to today as essential source material for century Irish history. Sir William also published important contributions to the study of Celtic antiquities and Irish folklore. Oscar mother, Jane, was a prominent Irish Nationalist and poet who was nearly imprisoned for her inflammatory anti-English writing in As Oscar would write from prison in ""She and my father had bequeathed me a name they had made noble and honoured not merely in literature, art, archaeology and science, but in the public history of my own country in its evolution as a nation."" He was homosexual from his schooldays This is most unlikely, to judge from his correspondence. He seems to have been infatuated with Florence Balcombe (who later married Bram Stoker) for two years until he left Oxford in and had previously flirted with other young women in Dublin. He married Constance Lloyd in swiftly had two children with her and, by his own account, was blissfully happy in the first few years of his marriage. His 'conversion' to homosexuality probably came about in with a young man who was to remain a lifelong friend, Robert Ross. He coasted through university, with a reputation for langorousness and a love of lilies Oscar was certainly influenced by the aesthetic theories of John Ruskin and Walter Pater while at Oxford, and he adopted the pose of an effete young man, but he went up as a scholar to Magdalen and came down with a double first in classics and the Newdigate prize for poetry. This took considerable application as his contemporaries later testified and his surviving Oxford notebooks demonstrate. Apart from writing a couple of plays, a few children stories, The Ballad of Reading Gaol and The Picture of Dorian Gray he doesn't seem to have done much Oscar erious' side is often overlooked. He spent a year in the US in lecturing about the decorative arts; he edited a high-profile woman magazine for two years; he wrote thought-provoking and controversial critical essays as well as many art exhibition, theatre and book reviews. He also applied twice, unsuccessfully, to become an Inspector of Schools; his effect on English education could have been startling. Being Irish was just an accident of birth; he was an English author, surely? In the sense that The Importance of Being Earnest and Lady Winderemere Fan are archetypically 'English' plays - perhaps; but there is a profound Irishness underlying much of what Oscar wrote and thought, especially in his correspondence. He may have remarked that the first thing he forgot at Oxford was his Irish accent, but when his play Salomé was banned he openly accused the English of being narrow-minded saying, ""I am not English; I'm Irish which is quite another thing."" 'Earnest' was a code-word for 'gay' and wearing a green carnation was a ecret' sign of homosexuality Both explanations seem to have been conveniently invented years later with little or no foundation in fact. 'Earnest' was supposedly a corruption of 'Uraniste' or one who practices Uranian or homosexual love, and the green carnation was said to be the badge of Parisian pederasts. If either had been true, Edward Carson, the Marquess of Queensberry defence lawyer in the libel trial, would certainly have pinpointed them, as he did the overtly gay passages in the magazine publication of The Picture of Dorian Gray (which were later suppressed in the book.) Oscar Wilde arrest was delayed by several hours to allow him to catch the last boat-train and escape to the continent When Oscar libel action against Queensberry collapsed, Queensberry lawyers sent all their papers to the director of public prosecutions, who consulted the solicitor-general and the home secretary and then immediately applied to the magistrates for a warrant. Oscar was arrested at though there were still four more trains to Paris that night. He was then twice prosecuted by the crown. The jury failed to agree on the first occasion, and the crown, though not obliged to do so, tried him again - hardly the action of a government anxious to see him escape. Once Oscar Wilde was arrested, tried and imprisoned, Lord Alfred Douglas, who essentially got him into the mess, abandoned him 'Bosie' Douglas, in a devoted but often muddle-headed way, was remarkably supportive when the crash came. He visited Oscar on remand in Holloway every day and only went to France before the first trial at the insistence of his brother and Oscar lawyers. After Oscar conviction he wrote a defence of their love for a French journal, which would have done more harm than good, and was never published. He also helped Oscar financially after his release from prison. Oscar Wilde died of syphilis This is an old canard which has been doing the rounds for nearly a century, and was lately championed on the flimsiest of evidence by his best modern biographer, Richard Ellmann. Killing Oscar off with the classic 'disease of the decadents' has always seemed a suitably sensational way of rounding off a sensational life, but modern medical opinion agrees almost universally that it was an ear infection and meningitis which did for him in the end. Oscar Wilde was merely a hedonist who, as he admitted, put his genius into his life but only his talent into his works At his trial Wilde said that his aim in life had been self-realisation through pleasure rather than suffering. Later, in his long prison letter to Douglas, De Profundis, he recants and admits that only through pain and sorrow can true nobility of soul be achieved. He was undeniably a first-rate funny-man, but the jury is still out on whether Wilde belongs in the top division of literature, a paradox which is part of his enduring appeal.",1019,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/07/top10s.oscar.wilde
40,"In a week when the new administration of president Donald Trump in the US has closed the door to travellers from seven Muslim countries, veteran traveller and broadcaster Michael Palin has praised the ability of travel writers to challenge preconceptions and help others understand “why people are so angry”. Speaking as he was honoured for his outstanding contribution to travel writing with the Edward Stanford award , Palin said: “You have got to understand why people are angry, why people do ridiculous brutal things. Not just Islamic terrorists, I mean, why do so many Americans shoot people in schools? We have to understand where these things come from and travel writing hopefully opens doors, when doors are being closed rather abruptly at the moment.” He added: “The best travel writing shows us the differences between us and what makes people special. That involves a whole way of looking at the world that is so completely different from the kneejerk reaction we are seeing from Washington at the moment.” The Monty Python star, who made his name as a travel writer and broadcaster in the with hit TV series and bestsellers Around the World in Eighty Days and Pole to Pole, said travel books offered a more personal perspective than TV, helping the reader to share the perspective of a traveller, but that he liked working in both media. “I like the combination of both television and books. I love the fact that my programmes were collaborations and feel upset that my crew, particularly my cameraman Nigel Meakin, never get mentioned and yet of those shots were chosen by him,” Palin said. Palin received his honour at the Edward Stanford travel writing awards on Thursday night, which saw another veteran writer Paul Theroux and his odyssey through his US homeland, Deep South , beaten to the Stanford Dolman travel book of the year by Julian Sayarer, with his American journey, Interstate . Throwing down the gauntlet to other writers and publishers present, Sayarer pledged to give half of his winnings to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). He added: “Anyone who wishes to match that amount, I will deal with the administration.” Chair of judges, travel writer and biographer Sara Wheeler, said Interstate was the jury unanimous choice. She described Sayarer, who once held the world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle, as “a brilliantly thoughtful writer with no shortage of passion and anger”. Wheeler described Interstate as “challenging and enigmatic – its power derives in part from what is left out. One can’t help thinking that the future of travel writing lies in this adventurous, postmodern genre.” However, she also lamented the lack of female entries: “No genre can survive without women and if any members of the Garrick Club are present and wish to dispute that, please see me afterwards.” In the Specsavers fiction (with a sense of place) award, Madeleine Thien novel Do Not Say We Have Nothing beat books by Man Booker winners Julian Barnes and Yann Martel. Chair of judges Lyn Hughes, co-founder of Wanderlust magazine, said Thien Man Booker-shortlisted novel, set against the backdrop of China Cultural Revolution, was “epic and powerful”. The Wanderlust adventure travel book of the year was taken by Levison Wood for his TV tie-in Walking the Himalayas, an account of his trek across the roof of the world. The judges said Wood exceeded the achievements of the accompanying TV series, giving the book “a real sense of travel and place”. The National Book Tokens children travel book of the year was named as Atlas of Animal Adventures by Lucy Letherland, Rachel Williams and Emily Hawkins, while food writer Tessa Kiros won the Food and Travel Magazine food and travel book of the year award for “a true culinary travel book”, Provence to Pondicherry: Recipes from France and Faraway.",642,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/03/michael-palin-takes-travel-writing-prize-hymning-genres-promotion-of-understanding
41,"don’t have time to write. There are too many emails to answer, too many tax and VAT issues to be sorted out and too many events at festivals, bookshops and conferences. There is cricket and tennis to be played, world wars to commemorate, friends to be met, plays and films to be seen, children to be encouraged and good causes to be supported. Another good way of not writing is doing “research”. I spent two months in Paris earlier this year, wandering the streets and looking for people to have dinner with. You end up saying yes to everything. A nice woman at the American library asked if I would come and talk to her writing group on a houseboat. In English you think: “Dream on.” In French, you say: “ Mais oui, volontiers. ” I was in Paris to look for “inspiration”, I told anyone who was kind enough to ask. Before I went, I tried to bring everything up to date in London. This included ringing the motor insurance people to renew the car cover. “Not a problem,” said the nice man. I gave him the details. “Not a problem,” he confirmed. I told him I was off to Paris to search for inspiration. “Inspiration?” he said. “Not a problem.” Nor was it, really. Loneliness focuses the mind pretty well; it sharpens the receptors. Though nothing works as well as the greatest element in all human endeavour: luck. To be reading the right book at the right time; to remember something random from many years ago that connects two disparate ideas flying through your head … In theory, I came back from Paris with the outline of a novel called Paris Pygmy and three notebooks full of jottings. That was on March, but I just haven’t had a chance to open the notebooks yet. Writing articles for newspapers about writing books – that also helpfully takes up writing time. Asking myself if I have a “routine” has become the only writing routine I still have. I wish I could remember otherwise, but answering the question so often has erased the memory of any regular procedure. Do I have a room where I write? Search me. I think there was one once, but I could no longer say where. And where do I get my ideas from? That at least is an easy question. I get them from a well outside a small mining village in New South Wales. I have a cottage there now, but am not prepared to reveal the name of the village. You can probably find it on GoogleMaps, though, if you type in “well” and “ideas”. Another excellent way of not writing is to update your website. There are so many parts of it that need attention now – the last three novels are lacking summaries, the audio-visual is out of date and so on. Going on Twitter is helpful, too, as I can then link into learned articles recommended by people I follow. I like to read about the Sykes-Picot pact . This often takes up more time than the compulsory Times crossword. In summer the test matches demand commitment. If I leave the room before Joe Root is established at the crease I feel it my fault if he out cheaply and a middle order collapse follows. Joe needs my active support. Regrettably, the aggressive style of modern cricket means the five-day matches seldom go the distance, so there is, hypothetically, a danger of doing some writing on a Monday. But the email backlog takes care of that. Once I used to draw the curtains, put in earplugs, take the phone off the hook, and make tea in a Thermos so there was no excuse to leave the desk. Once, on a roll with Human Traces , I even toyed with the idea of installing a catheter. But, really. I ask you. What sort of existence is that? Drilling down fathoms into the internal lives of people who don’t exist? Not writing, by contrast, is more various and more challenging. It a life.

42,"ver since Alexander Pope liberating declaration that “the proper study of mankind is man”, there been a strong thread of intimate life-writing braided into the catalogue of English prose. Today, no bookshop is complete without its table of memoirs, reminiscences or confessional autobiographies, each owing something to Rousseau ( Les Confessions ) and, possibly, to Goethe ( Dichtung und Wahrheit ), but perhaps most immediately, above all, to De Quincey. There is something so wonderfully modern and provisional about Thomas De Quincey that, of all the writers in this series, he a figure you could imagine seeing but perhaps not conversing with – in Covent Garden (where much of Confessions was written) or on a stagecoach to London (he was incurably nomadic). The back-story to this classic memoir is simple enough. De Quincey was always a drop-out and a drifter. Inspired by the French Revolution, he says, he ran away from school in his teens, wandered homelessly in Wales and London, somehow got to Oxford, where he acquired the taste for opium, and began to discover his raison d’etre: My life has been, on the whole, the life of a philosopher: from my birth, I was made an intellectual creature; and intellectual in the highest sense my pursuits and pleasures have been, even from my schoolboy days. If opium-eating be a sensual pleasure, it is no less true that I have struggled against this fascination with a fervent zeal, and have at length untwisted, almost to its final links, the chain which fettered me. Such self-conquest may be set off in counterbalance to any degree of self-indulgence. There little doubt that, to De Quincey, there was probably no one quite as interesting as himself. But he was not just an obsessive narcissicist; he could be a good companion, too. He certainly seems gifted with an instinctive sympathy for his literary contemporaries. After Oxford, having met Coleridge and Wordsworth, and subsequently flourishing as their admirer and friend, he settled in the Lake District, at Grasmere. Here, he fell under the spell of the Lake Poets to become a full-blown and in some senses archetypal Romantic. By he was also fully addicted to opium; then he married a wealthy farmer daughter, ran through her money and, finally, turned to journalism to make ends meet. Confessions of an Opium-Eater , first published anonymously (to some metropolitan sensation) in the London Magazine in appeared in book form in and secured De Quincey reputation. He was For the next years, he would live precariously, in the more marginal purlieus of Grub Street, as the author of this increasingly famous memoir. De Quincey rather majestic, classically learned and singular style inspires every page of his writing. His Confessions guarantees him a place in this series as a writer whose life and writing were equally expressive of an unquenchable originality of thought and behaviour. Consider, for instance, his acknowledgement of the drug whose symptoms were “as though rats were gnawing at the coats of one stomach”. Taking inspiration from Walter Raleigh History of the World De Quincey salutes his drug as Raleigh had once saluted death: Oh! Just, subtle, and mighty opium! That to the hearts of poor and rich alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for “the pangs that tempt the spirit to rebel”, bringest an assuaging balm; eloquent opium! That with thy potent rhetoric stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the guilty man, for one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands washed pure of blood; O just and righteous opium! That to the chancery of dreams summonest, for the triumphs of despairing innocence, false witnesses… De Quincey Confessions fall into two parts. The first describes, often in comic terms, his schooling and adolescence in Manchester, and his subsequent wanderings in Wales, culminating in his life as a homeless vagrant, living among the street-walkers of Oxford Street, in the London of Part two focuses on opium, the drug itself, and De Quincey addiction to it. He divides this subject into “The Pleasures of Opium” followed by “The Pains of Opium”. In both, his prose, even when it plumbs the darker parts of his experience, teeters on the brink of the ecstatic, using language that would later be echoed by William Burroughs and JG Ballard: The sense of space, and in the end, the sense of time, were both powerfully affected. Buildings, landscapes, etc were exhibited in proportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to conceive. Space swelled, and was amplified to an extent of unutterable infinity. This, however, did not disturb me so much as the vast expansion of time; I sometimes seemed to have lived for or years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings representative of a millennium passed in that time, or, however, of a duration far beyond the limits of any human experience. De Quincey, on the evidence of his own narrative, appears to have had the constitution of a thoroughbred. Certainly, in his mature years, he was ingesting enough opium to kill a horse, apparently, between and drops a day. He writes: My daily ration was eight thousand drops [which later fell] spontaneously from a varying quantity of eight, ten, or twelve thousand drops of laudanum to about three hundred. By middle age, he had got his addiction pretty much under control, but he was still afflicted with his former nightmares: My dreams are not calm; the dread swell and agitation of the storm have not wholly subsided; my sleep is still tumultuous; and, like the gates of Paradise to our first parents when looking back from afar, it is still (in the tremendous line of Milton) “With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms”. All things considered, the self-controlled equanimity of this classic volume is little short of miraculous. It is never less than a pleasure to be in De Quincey company. The reader never quite knows what he going to say next, but it always diverting, never dull, and as full of Romantic enchantment as you’d expect from a lifelong friend of the incomparable Coleridge. A signature sentence I, for my part, after I had become a regular opium-eater, and from mismanagement had fallen into miserable excesses in the use of opium, did nevertheless, four several times, contend successfully against the dominion of this drug; did four several times renounce it; renounced it for long intervals; and finally resumed it upon the warrant of my enlightened and deliberate judgment, as being of two evils by very much the least.

43,"y first book was published when I was I was at that time a copywriter, earning a living by removing errant apostrophes from clothing catalogues, and drafting news reports for legal journals. Before then, I had been a civil servant (a job to which I was ill-suited in every respect), a minimum-wage shop worker, a nanny, an office temp and a legal administrator. Often I am asked what possessed me to join the civil service straight after graduation, and the frank answer is that I had supported myself financially since I was and needed to earn a living: writing, my long-held ambition, would have to wait. When it became intolerable to me that I was not doing the one thing I had ever felt would give my life purpose, I applied for an MA and then a PhD in creative writing (funded by a tax rebate and a scholarship respectively). I began a novel, and abandoned it, and wrote a series of earnest and trite short stories; I took up the novel again, and wrote a thesis on the gothic, and all the while carried out my full-time work as a secretary to a committee of barristers. It never occurred to me that I would be able to make a living from writing fiction, and I did not in the least resent my day job, though naturally I occasionally imagined finding a hoard of Saxon gold in the back garden. I knew that Philip Larkin had been a librarian in Hull , that TS Eliot had worked in a bank, that Harper Lee had worked for an airline . I knew that some books achieved vast advances, but that these were both rare and potentially something of a poisoned chalice. In due course my first novel was sold for an advance entirely in keeping with a strange book already turned down by upward of a dozen publishers, which is to say, roughly a month wages. I continued to write copy for lawyers’ websites, pausing sometimes to look out of the window and think about the legend I’d recently heard of an ancient serpent menacing Essex. Debts were large; money was tight; my laptop – which I’d once inadvertently set on fire while cleaning the keyboard with a canister of compressed air – did not work unless plugged in, and was too heavy to carry for long without backache. The prospect of writing a second novel – destined for an indifferent readership, likely to earn little money – while working late into the night transcribing interminable interviews with businessmen was daunting. But my agent and publisher were warmly supportive, and at any rate I had nothing better to do with my life. If you need not earn much, you are at liberty to write, and write, and write. And writing requires practice Then, in I won the East Anglian book of the year award [for After Me Comes the Flood ]. The effect of the prize was twofold. First, it conferred the sense of legitimacy that I’d never quite been able to summon up: a group of writers had admired my work, and they wanted me to write more. I was by then already at work on my second novel, The Essex Serpent , but always dogged by a curious sense of foolishness. I was poor, and getting poorer: what was I thinking, staring at the wall making things up, when I could do something both more useful and more remunerative? Ought I to have been a barrister? Should I perhaps teach? Writing felt, obscurely, like a moral failing. Then I was handed a glass trophy and a cheque at a ceremony in a Norwich department store, and felt suddenly at ease. Most practically, the prize enabled me to replace my laptop with a slender one light enough to carry on trains, and able to retain its charge. I did not need it, precisely – one can write novels in mud with a pointed stick – but I felt like an apprentice carpenter given the tools of the trade by a benevolent guild. I bought stickers reading THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS and DON’T PANIC in nods to Woody Guthrie and Douglas Adams, fixed them to the lid, and set about my writing with vigour vastly renewed. On my laptop, I have written two novels, two short stories, and innumerable essays and articles. It now contains a document tentatively labelled and following a period of immense good fortune I am free to choose what I write, when I write it, and for whom. Desmond Elliott prize for new fiction reveals all-female shortlist This year I am chair of judges for the Desmond Elliott prize , an award for the best first novel of the year. It was set up in memory of the late literary agent, who arrived in London from Ireland with two pounds in his pocket, and went on to represent Jilly Cooper and Penny Vincenzi. But it is perhaps more accurately an award in support of the second novel, since its prize is explicitly intended to nurture the winner next work, and offer stability and support as they continue to develop their practice. The debut novelist comes equipped with a certain glamour that swiftly fades. Each year the newspapers present, with an enthusiasm that I at any rate find infectious, the “new intake” of writers. There is always the possibility that among those unfamiliar voices will be one still speaking from the shelves in decades to come. Debuts only rarely constitute the best of a writer output but it is striking to note how frequently debut novelists are unable to fulfil their early promise, and how easily the roving spotlight of literary attention moves on to fresher faces. I am particularly invested in the notion of a prize for debuts which frankly acknowledges the need to help authors into the next stage of their career, because I know how a prize can prove transformative both in terms of financial support and in conveying a sense of legitimacy. When I was first published, I confess I felt some anxiety about myself: about the Essex accent that makes itself known unless I concentrate, my lack of connections through family and friends, my polytechnic degree. Would I feel like Pip in Great Expectations , mocked by Estella: “He calls the knaves jacks, this boy”? The Essex Serpent by Sarah Perry review – a compulsive novel of ideas As it turned out, I discovered that organisations such as Arts Emergency and the Arts Council were working to correct a historical skew towards a certain kind of publishing culture (and I was delighted to find that my own publisher was the first to offer internships on a London living wage). Where inequalities in publishing persist, money is often at the heart of the matter. If you are able to devote yourself to writing from, say, your late teens – because you need not earn much, if at all; because you do not need to care for children, or family members; because a friend friend needs someone to house-sit their Edinburgh flat for six months – you are at liberty to write, and write, and write. And writing, like playing the piano, or lathing a cabinet smooth, requires practice. Awards such as the Desmond Elliott prize can help to put a spirit level over the playing field. Any entrant can find themselves suddenly in possession of a sum that is not life-changing, but which will buy a degree of freedom to write, or a necessary research trip, or – as in my case – sharper tools. Writers are not owed a living any more than other artists, and financial prizes are not precisely necessary . Put your mind to it, and you can write a slender volume of verse on the back of till receipts with a stolen Argos biro. But writing is difficult for everyone, and more difficult for some than for others. And in a society in which some communities are significantly more likely to lack financial privilege those difficulties can stultify and narrow the culture. There are many voices going unheard, and it both a duty and a pleasure to help pass on the amplifier.

44,"I first read Melmoth the Wanderer more than a decade ago, after stumbling across a battered copy I picked up for a few pounds in a secondhand bookshop by the sea. Although its author, Charles Maturin , might not be as well known as his near contemporaries – Shelley, Bram Stoker – he succeeded in producing a gothic horror so mind-bogglingly sophisticated that he certainly should be. I was staying in a bed and breakfast in Suffolk at the time, and in the day I walked along the beach, while my nights were spent in an armchair in the corner of my room, reading the book. I remember it was a warm December, and in the evenings I would sit with the windows open. The curtains would flap and a salt breeze would blow into the room, and as I read I could hear the whisper of a name on the wind. Maturin was a protestant Dubliner and an eccentric priest, prone to sermonising and fond of dancing. In he wrote to his friend the author Walter Scott, to say that he was working on a novel so terrifying that it would succeed in “out-Heroding all the Herods” of the German school of gothic authors – Schiller, Hoffmann, Goethe – who were enjoying popularity at the time. Melmoth the Wanderer opens with a student, John Melmoth, leaving college to attend to his uncle deathbed in a house on a clifftop by the coast. John sees a painting of a distant relative on the wall, dated several centuries back – a painting with cold, dead eyes. John enquires about the subject, and his uncle tells him that “the original is still alive … you shall see him again”. It becomes apparent that John ancestor, in proto-Dorian Gray fashion (it is no coincidence that Maturin was Oscar Wilde great-uncle) has made a Faustian pact with Satan for extra years of life. However, unless Melmoth can convince someone to agree to take his place, at the end of the years he will be consigned to burn in hell for eternity. Melmoth has all the devil powers at his disposal, and he spends his years roaming the earth, looking for someone to take the curse from him, moving in and out of locked cells, floating across seas and continents. The night after John uncle death there is a storm. John watches in horror from the house as a Spanish sailing ship crashes on the rocks. He looks across the cliffs and sees a shadowy stranger laughing maniacally as the wreckage is smashed upon the rocks. The next morning, one of the survivors of the wreck – a Spanish sailor – sits with John and tells him his story. He has, he explains, been visited by a shadowy stranger while being held by the Spanish Inquisition in Madrid. After escaping, he comes across a manuscript that details the murder of a woman in the same city. In that manuscript, the woman father meets a shadowy stranger at an inn, who tells him the story of a starving man on the verge of murdering his family. The starving man is visited by another shadowy stranger, who offers him food and salvation, for a price. Stories, within stories, within stories. Melmoth is a gothic matryoshka of fictions inside one another, and the common thread is the Wanderer, moving through every level, never present but always there – spoken of in whispers and hearsay. He is terrifying in his absence, moving through a Daedelian nightmare of narrative strands that twine into one another. The novel is not linear, like “beads on a string” (an analogy he borrows from Aristotle) but instead, like the Wanderer, jumps back and forth – diabolically outside of time. Although eventually I shut the book and left the house, it has stayed with me ever since. I remember the phrase Melmoth whispers to John on the night of the shipwreck, during a nightmare. “You have burned me, then; but those are flames I can survive – I am alive – I am beside you.”",680,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/23/melmoth-the-wanderer-by-charles-maturin-a-gothic-matryoshka
45,"The art critic, essayist and novelist John Berger threw down his challenge early in his television series Ways of Seeing. This came in the year when Berger, who has died aged broke through to real fame from his niche celebrity on the arts pages of the New Statesman. Ways of Seeing, made on the cheap for the BBC as four half-hour programmes, was the first series of its kind since Civilisation one-hour episodes for which Kenneth Clark , its writer and presenter, and a BBC production team had travelled miles through countries exploring years of the visual culture of the western world. Berger travelled as far as the hut in Ealing, west London where his programmes were filmed, and no farther. What he said in his characteristic tone of sweet reasonableness was: “In his book on the nude, Kenneth Clark says that being naked is simply being without clothes. The nude, according to him, is a form of art. I would put it differently: to be naked is to be oneself; to be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognised for oneself. A nude has to be seen as an object in order to be a nude.” In other words, art is a commodity and a woman in art is an object. No approach to art could have been more different from Clark gentlemanly urbanity. These demotic programmes turned Berger into the hero of a generation studying the burgeoning new university courses on European visual culture. The spin-off book was never out of print. Clark, meanwhile, found himself derided as Lord Clark of Civilisation. Ways of Seeing was Berger apotheosis as a populariser, but in this year too he won the Booker prize, the James Tait Black Memorial prize and the Guardian Fiction prize with his novel G. In he had published, with his frequent collaborator the photographer Jean Mohr, A Fortunate Man, a sensitive documentary account of a country doctor on his daily round in Gloucestershire. These three books began to sketch out the areas of Berger lifetime enterprise. They were preceded by the publication of The Success and Failure of Picasso and Art and Revolution: Ernst Neizvestny and the Role of the Artist in the USSR in one, he made a hopeless mess of Picasso later career, though he was not alone in this; in the other, he elevated a brave dissident artist beyond his talents. The success and failure of John Berger was not predictable for a boy born in Stoke Newington, north London, into a prosperous middle-class family, even though his mother, Miriam (nee Branson), had been born in working-class Bermondsey. His father, Stanley Berger, had wanted to be a priest, but while serving on the front in the first world war he lost his faith and won an MC, to which in peacetime he added being appointed OBE for his pioneering work in business cost accounting. He left St Edward school, Oxford, at to study at the Central School of Art; his course was interrupted in when he was called up and posted to a Belfast training depot, where he served as a lance-corporal in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. It was his first day-by-day encounter with the working classes and it shaped his politics for life. On demob, Berger continued his education at Chelsea School of Art In a Barbican Gallery exhibition devoted to the London art scene included an unremarkable Berger painting of scaffolding on the South Bank site for the Festival of Britain, but when I interviewed Berger for the publication of the stories collected in Pig Earth in he pointed out on the walls of his mother well-appointed flat near Regent Park a couple of his paintings of peasants at work, a kind of stylised realism not far from the approach of the Italian realist Renato Guttuso , about whom Berger would later write extensively. The pictures clearly showed that he might have made some kind of a career in painting, though fortune was smiling on him when he chose to write instead. After college he taught drawing at St Mary teacher training college at Strawberry Hill, Twickenham, southwest London, continued to paint, and exhibited his work at the Leicester, Redfern and Wildenstein galleries. It was not until a friend invited him to give a series of talks on art for the BBC World Service that he found his feet. In he showed the scripts for a couple of his broadcasts to TC Worsley, literary editor of the New Statesman, and began a stretch as a controversial and highly influential art critic for the journal, often singling out for praise an artist nobody else had heard of. This who he? element became a regular feature of his writings, but never seems to have damaged his reputation. His first published collection of essays in was mostly drawn from his New Statesman reviews. He called it after the artist colour option Permanent Red (pun intended: his US publishers pointedly retitled the book Toward Reality: Essays in Seeing). In it, magisterially, he categorised artists under chapter headings such as Artists Defeated by the Difficulties and Artists Who Struggle. The first category included Jackson Pollock – an unconvincing essay in which he could not quite bring himself to write the artist off though he did assign to his work the dreaded description “decorative” – Naum Gabo, Paul Klee, Jean Dubuffet and – which dates the collection – John Bratby . The second, containing implicitly greater artists, included Henry Moore, Ceri Richards, David Bomberg, George Fullard and Friso ten Holt, a Dutchman who remained doggedly obscure despite Berger advocacy. An essay in Permanent Red headed Who Is an Artist? imagines the thought processes of an artist lying under a beech tree and assessing shapes, light, space and volume: prefacing all the argumentative pieces about the role of art in society, it briefly indicates why Berger was a successful and popular teacher and how perceptive he could have been as a critic had he not been so prescriptive. Although Berger emergence as television populist sage in Ways of Seeing was a throwback to the dogmatism of Permanent Red, it was an extraordinary trick to have pulled off. A running theme was that portable oil paintings came at the right time in the growth of capitalism to be used for publicity and propaganda, a use vastly expanded with the invention of photography. The Guardian art critic of the time, Norbert Lynton, wrote bluntly: “I often cannot believe Berger ... it is clear from his writings that he is a sensitive man and in many ways a wise one, and that he is willing to lie about art to make his political points.” “Lie” may be a bit strong, but in his early days Marxist dialectic did force him into uncomfortable contortions. Lynton may, to take one example, have been thinking of what Berger had to say about the analysis of Frans Hals two last paintings by the scholar of Netherlands art Seymour Slive. Slive closely shows how the paintings work technically as group portraits of the governors and governesses of the Haarlem almshouses where the impoverished Hals himself received charity; but Berger says of Slive analysis, “It as though the author wants to mask the images, as though he fears their directness and accessibility.” However prone Slive may be to an art historian preference for painterly values over social discourse, his analysis is nevertheless closer to the heart of the matter than Berger fanciful account of a kind of class stand-off between the destitute artist and the governors, not least because on another and more likely reading, given Hals approach to portraiture even of men and women in their prime, these two groups are painted with compassion but above all with a sharp eye for laying down what was before him. Though Berger never specifically recanted, he did later admit that Ways of Seeing was too rushed and crude, and that he had not allowed for the genius factor. All the same, if urgency and clarity were at this stage Berger great virtues as a writer, as a television performer he also brought warmth and an engagingly persuasive personality to bear. It is inevitable that this huge success remains the main element of Berger career, but his more impressive work was rooted in his life-changing decision in to abandon England as his home and settle first in Geneva, and then from in a remote peasant community at Quincy in the Haute-Savoie. The intellectual climate of England was too unserious for him. Visitors to Berger noticed how the villagers took to him and his family as easily as he had to them. The outcast in his native London had come home. Here Berger remote situation allowed him the time and serenity to stitch his writing into a seamless garment fitting to the village life in which he helped whenever extra hands were needed, at harvest time or with animal husbandry. He had already published his first novel, A Painter of Our Time, in The painter of the title is a Hungarian refugee from fascism who, just as he achieves a great success in London, returns to Budapest to take part in the uprising against Soviet domination and is not heard of again. This is a satisfying tale of personal and artistic integrity, though the painter has uncannily similar views to the author own much bruited opinions on life and art. Berger followed this with two less successful novels, The Foot of Clive and Corker Freedom before G, with its three prizes in Guests at the lunch for the Guardian award held their breath: at the Booker award a few days earlier Berger had attacked the sponsors for exploitation of their Caribbean workforce, and announced that he would be giving half the prize to the Black Panthers, the revolutionary movement. The Guardian editor, Alastair Hetherington, said in his speech that he would double the prize money (admittedly small to start with) if Berger would give half of it to a constructive cause rather than the obviously destructive Black Panthers. Berger turned away wrath with a smile, and with warmth and grace accepted the Guardian cheque. Yet G is a not just a powerful book, it is powerfully flawed as well. It is an experimental novel at a time when experiment was the norm, influenced by the French nouveau roman. The structure, with its lumpen authorial interpolations, is painting by numbers: here is one of many possible examples from early in the novel when the rich father of the hero is speaking of his journey through the Alps to be reunited with his mistress (whom he addresses as a sparrow): “‘Ah! Laura. To think that I came under those mountains, the tunnel is fifteen kilometres long, fifteen. It is a marvel ... And on this side of the mountain, passeretta mia , you are waiting for me.’ “(The St Gothard tunnel was opened in Eight hundred men lost their lives in its construction.)” Cervantes had made this sort of writer intervention with a better and lighter touch years earlier. Nevertheless, it seemed that Berger had found his vocation as novelist, playwright, screenwriter and (much less known) poet of simplicity and lucidity – enough verse to put together in a Collected Poems The half of the Booker money that he didn’t give to the Black Panthers he spent on putting together, with Mohr again, a book called A Seventh Man It was more ambitious than A Fortunate Man, an attempt to describe in verse, fiction, reportage, photographs and readymade images the lives of Europe million migrant workers. The modernist method that marred G worked much better in this media montage, and it was received with acclaim. His first peasant work of fiction – or storytelling, as from his adopted peasant way of life he preferred to call it – was Pig Earth, produced in by Writers and Readers, a publishing co-operative that Berger helped to set up and finance. It was a collection of tales developed from the talk of his fellow villagers, seemingly as close to the lives of these peasants and their animals as their own skins. It concluded with three stories about the murder of Lucie Cabrol and her presence after death in the community. Simon McBurney and Mark Wheatley adapted them into a play, The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol : when the Complicite company took it to the Shaftesbury theatre, the Guardian critic Michael Billington described the production as “one of the supreme theatrical experiences in all London”. His next two books, Once in Europa and Lilac and Flag were each a collection of discrete stories accumulating into a novel, and were brought together with Pig Earth in a trilogy published as Into Their Labours Three years later he published To the Wedding and gave all his royalties to the London Lighthouse, an organisation supporting the victims of Aids. Though he never admitted it publicly, the writing of this novel was prompted by the death of his daughter-in-law from an Aids-related virus. The book is a remarkable achievement in which the sequences covering many years and several countries mesh effortlessly into a lucid yet almost visionary tale of a young footloose and fancy-free woman, Ninon, who is dying of Aids after a casual sexual encounter on a beach. She later falls in love with a man who, regardless, decides to marry her. The account mixes the method of magic fiction and a Greek chorus – a blind seller of little metal religous votive plaques, tamata , who has the power to zoom in on the lives of the other characters – with lyrical descriptions of Ninon fancy-free life and sharp cinematic cuts between brief sequences describing the journey of her mother from Austria and her father (Berger motorbike-riding doppelgänger) from France to Ninon wedding in the village church of Gorino in the delta of the river Po. With this book Berger arrived at a mastery that he displayed again in Photocopies a collection of encounters with real and imagined characters, and later books. He continued to write about art, but related it more closely to his personal experience, and though he never ceased to believe in the perfectibility of society, he edged towards an understanding of Marxism as an analytical tool rather than an infallible cure for the ills of the world. His first marriage, to the artist and illustrator Pat Marriott in ended in divorce. His second marriage, in the was to the Russian Anya Bostock (nee Anna Sisserman); they split up in Soon after he married for a third time, to the American Beverly Bancroft, who worked with the British Library on its acquisition of the Berger archive , now open to the public.

46,"f you’re a political outsider who wants to move fast to the top job in a democracy, how to do it? You could start by dipping into a book written years ago by an out-of-pocket Italian civil servant. The quickest way, it says, is to have fortune on your side from the outset, with plenty of inherited money and a leg up through family connections. If lying and breaking your oaths help you crush the opposition, so be it. Make the people your best friend. Promise to protect their interests against predatory elites and foreigners. Fan partisan hatreds so that you alone seem to rise above them, saviour of the fatherland. Machiavelli The Prince, part the challenge of power | Nick Spencer The book is The Prince , its author Niccolò Machiavelli. Minus television and Twitter, it seems the techniques of ambitious “new princes”, as he calls them, haven’t changed a bit. But why did Machiavelli write a whole book about them, peppering it with men who soared to power by greasing palms and exploiting weaknesses: Julius Caesar, Pope Alexander VI, Cesare Borgia? Most people today assume that Machiavelli didn’t just describe their methods, he recommended them – that he himself is the original Machiavellian, the first honest teacher of dishonest politics. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the adjective has come to mean “cunning, scheming, and unscrupulous, especially in politics”. Along with our daily news, popular culture has brought legions of Machiavellian figures into our homes and made them both human and entertaining: Tony Soprano , Frank and Claire Underwood in House of Cards , Lord Petyr Baelish from Game of Thrones . These Machiavellians are scoundrels, but subtle ones. In watching their manoeuvres on screen we, like their victims, can’t help being a little seduced by their warped ingenuity. So it no longer shocks us to think that a highly intelligent man who lived five centuries ago, in times we imagine were far crueller than ours, spent night after night at his desk in the Tuscan countryside, his wife and children sleeping nearby, drafting the rulebook for today cynical populists and authoritarians. But what if we’re overlooking Machiavelli less obvious messages, his deeper insights into politics? Until about a decade ago, it never occurred to me to ask this question. It was part of my job to teach Plato-to-Nato courses in the history of ideas, and Machiavelli came up early in the year, squeezed between Augustine and Hobbes. Like thousands of overworked lecturers, I had my shortcuts. Picking up The Prince or Discourses , I’d highlight all the attention-grabbing Machiavellian phrases and skim the rest. Academic summaries told me that Machiavelli was devoted to the salvation of his native city, Florence, and his country, Italy, at a time when both were ravaged by wars. Yes, he made sinister excuses for violence and hypocrisy. But his reasons were patriotic, well-meaning, human. Yet the more I read, the more I questioned this story. I started noticing that Machiavelli writings speak in different voices at different times. At one moment he seems to applaud men who break their oaths at will, caring little for just dealings. But he also says – in a passage most scholars pass over – that “victories are never secure without some respect, especially for justice”. For every cynical Machiavellian precept, I found two or three others that clashed with it. I began to doubt that Machiavelli believed his own advice. These doubts grew as I delved into his life and times, trying to understand what made him say what he did. The usual story is that he wrote The Prince as a job application, when he was seeking work as an adviser to Florence first family, the super-wealthy Medici . But as a leading civil servant in charge of foreign affairs and defence, Machiavelli had been one of the republic stoutest defenders. Just a year before he finished the first draft of his “little book”, the Medici swept into Florence in a foreign-backed coup after spending years in exile. They were deeply suspicious of his loyalties, dismissed him from his posts, then had him imprisoned and tortured under suspicion of plotting against them. If Machiavelli did send the Medici The Prince , which seems unlikely, he could not have expected them to take its “advice” – to bribe, swindle, and assassinate one way to power – as gifts of friendly wisdom. Nor would it have helped his cause that he addresses the Medici as “princes” in his dedication, and insists on their remoteness from the people. Just like modern dictators, the Medici were keen to keep up the fiction that they were mere “first citizens” in Florence republic, not monarchs or tyrants. Calling them princes was an audacious piece of cheek. No wonder readers of The Prince in the early modern era – philosophers such as Francis Bacon, Spinoza and Rousseau – had no doubt the book was a cunning exposé of princely snares, a self-defence manual for citizens. “The book of republicans,” Rousseau dubbed it. Don’t judge by reputation or appearances. “Take nothing on authority.” These are among Machiavelli less-known maxims, and we should apply them to his own words. If we look again at how he lived his life and how that life shaped his thoughts, it looks as if we’ve got Machiavelli all wrong. And it time we got him right, because no contemporary writer is a better guide to understanding and confronting our own political world. Both as secretary to the republic and through his writings – which include reams of poetry, risqué comedies and a quietly tragic history of Florence – he spent his life fighting to defend his city republican government against threats from within and without. It was a hard fight, with battles on many fronts. It took Machiavelli on a long journey across France with King Louis XII, and to the court of Cesare Borgia, where he spent nerve-racking months trying to dissuade the violent youth from attacking Florence. Machiavelli was convinced the real threats to freedom come from within – from gross inequalities on the one hand, and extreme partisanship on the other. He saw first-hand that authoritarian rule can take root and flourish in such conditions with terrifying ease, even in republics like Florence that had proud traditions of popular self-government. His city tempestuous history taught Machiavelli a lesson he tries to convey to future readers: that no one man can overpower a free people unless they let him. “Men are so simple,” he tells us, “so obedient to present necessities, that he who deceives will always find someone who will let himself be deceived.” To each of us, he says: don’t become that someone. Citizens need to realise that by trusting leaders too much and themselves too little, they create their own political nightmares. “I’d like to teach them the way to hell,” he told a friend toward the end of his life, “so they can steer clear of it.” So what can citizens can do to preserve their freedoms? For one thing, they can train themselves to see through the various ruses in the would-be tyrant handbook. Machiavelli The Prince describes most of them, in ways that mimic their disorienting ambiguity. On the day Donald Trump signed his executive order on immigration from seven countries, for instance, these comments were painfully apt: Between his double-edged lines, Machiavelli makes it clear why popular government is better than authoritarian rule Nothing makes a new prince so esteemed as to carry on great enterprises and give rare examples of himself. In our times we have Ferdinand of Aragon. If you consider his actions, you will find them great and some of them extraordinary. He kept the minds of the barons of Castile preoccupied with war; so they did not perceive that he was acquiring reputation and power over them. Besides this, to undertake greater enterprises, always making use of religion, he turned to an act of pious cruelty, expelling the Marranos [forcibly converted Muslims and Jews] and purging them from his kingdom; nor could there be a more wretched example than this. And so he has always done and ordered great things, which have always kept the minds of his subjects in suspense and admiration and occupied with their outcome. And his actions have followed one upon another so that men never have time to work steadily against him. When we know that these words are Machiavelli, we tend to let his reputation colour how we read them. But if an anonymous poster were to put up this passage online, how would you take it: as lavish praise for a great leader statesmanship, or deadpan sendup of his grandiosity and cheap tricks? You might suspect that it all a braintease, a test of whether you can smell trouble behind big talk and manic hyperactivity. And you might wonder: can distraction tactics like these ever bring states lasting security? Machiavelli answer is, no, they can’t. True political success needs completely different methods: low-key diplomacy, long-range solutions to complicated problems. Alongside his lessons for citizens, he also has a message for new populist princes. You might, he tells them, rise with ease to the top by using divide-and-rule tactics and other stock manipulations. People might believe your self-serving version of reality – the world of us-versus-a-thousand-predators – for a while. But in the daily grind of governing, harder realities bite. Then you’ll be tempted to show everyone who boss, and try to ascend from a civil order to an absolute one. But be warned: citizens who are used to being governed by laws and magistrates are not ready, in these emergencies, to obey a despot. And if you do steal their freedoms, they never forget them. “The memory of their old liberty cannot let them rest.” They’ll fight you down to the scorched and bloody earth. Oh, and don’t bother building walls to keep out foreigners. Poisonous inequalities, citizens who hate each other, government that lacks legitimacy: these are what make states vulnerable. Walls just advertise your failure to deal with them. Today, yet again, old and new democracies are fighting for their lives. Between his double-edged lines, Machiavelli makes it clear why law-governed popular government is always better than authoritarian rule: “A people who can do whatever it wants is unwise, but a prince who can do whatever he wants is crazy.” His life and words inspire us to become sharper readers of political danger signs, and ruthless warriors for our freedoms.

47,"n Italian author and journalist Roberto Saviano published Gomorrah , an exposé of the organised crime network Camorra; since then he has had to live under police protection. The book was adapted for the big screen in and for TV in Other works include ZeroZeroZero , an investigation into the cocaine trade; his new novel, The Piranhas , a story about children gangs in Naples, is published on September by Picador. How did you get the idea for this novel? It was such a powerful news story : children who suddenly became mafia leaders. Mafias have always employed muschilli – little mosquitoes – in minor roles. But for a few years, in Naples, kids aged between and were in charge: they decided the drug deals, the money laundering, the executions… I wanted to find out more. Did you find some positive aspects in these characters? Of course – these kids are highly talented. I interviewed the survivors in jail, and there was great humanity there. They managed zones generating up to half a million euros a weekend, selling weed, huge amounts of cocaine. Imagine a who has to import drugs, set a price, pay the police, pay a percentage to the locals to keep quiet. It like giving a the keys to a supermarket and saying: “Manage it.” Someone who can do that has great entrepreneurial spirit – if they’d had a legal opportunity they’d have been incredible businessmen. What are their motivations? None of them are doing it out of hunger. They’re pushed by a complicated reality where it almost impossible to make money legally: there are no decent jobs, unless a relative recommends you. So those with ambition are drawn to crime, even though they know they’re going to die: “If you die at you die old news. If you die at you die a legend.” Most of the kids the characters in the novel are based on are dead. What was your childhood in Naples&nbsp;like? I was born in and at the end of the there was an incredible Camorra war – dead, three or four a day. I saw my first corpse in my first year of secondary school. Since then I’ve seen dozens. They didn’t shock me. As soon as we heard of one, my friends and I would immediately go see it. It was a way of saying, “we’re grownups” – anyone who didn’t look at corpses was still a child. Once we saw a Camorrista drowned in milk, in a mozzarella vat. But for me it was unthinkable to be a Camorrista leader at My family and upbringing protected me. These kids also have an idea of “everything, now” that my generation didn’t have. They live on Facebook and Instagram, boasting about their feats… Did you feel a responsibility not to glorify this world? This is something I’m often accused of, but I think it exactly the opposite. Criminals build their power on glamour, and you pull that apart not by denying it exists, but by showing what behind it: the years in jail, the consequences, the ridiculous theatre of it. Imagine a dark room. You go in, turn on the light, and see a corpse. It like blaming the murder on whoever turned on the light. Do you think books have the power to change what happening? We are constantly immersed in words; the problem is that words have no weight any more. The American president can one day say one thing about Russia , and then the next day overturn it with no consequences. Literature can return a specific weight to words. My battle with books continues, even though everything I’ve written has got me into trouble: Gomorrah when I was ZeroZeroZero was, disastrously, found in the lair of El Chapo . Today, for Italy, it even more necessary – we’re in a dramatic situation where maybe books can do something. I’m not sure I’m going to win, but I’m sure this is the way to change things. What do you find most worrying in Italy at the moment? This is a dangerous government, which risks being the first clearly authoritarian government in Europe [this century]. Salvini words are close to the words of Orbán, of Putin. He based his whole campaign on attacking migrants, while never saying anything against the mafia, of which he understands nothing. The word “fascism” should be used with caution, but when politicians like Salvini start quoting Mussolini (“so many enemies, so much honour”) is it appropriate? I realise that the word “fascist” denotes a specific historical period, but there are some expressions, some hints, that bring to mind a continuity with fascism. We don’t have blood yet. In Italy, for now we don’t have night-time arrests, the murders of journalists, as is happening in Russia, Jordan, Venezuela. What we have is isolation, civil and legal attacks – Salvini criticised me [ threatening to remove his police protection ] as a minister, not as a person, which is unusual. [Salvini party] Lega is close to neofascism: from his ridiculous T-shirts to his choice of words, he draws on neofascist ideology, because he doesn’t have one of his own, only a generic street populism, not a doctrine. So the word “fascist” is perhaps too quick, too easy, but it not far from describing a genetic link. What are your thoughts on the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa? In the past few years in Italy there have been several incidents in which infrastructure collapsed, crushing people, so there are clearly issues with maintenance. What not clear is whether people safety has been sacrificed only for profit or also for political gain. From the moment the bridge collapsed we’ve seen an unedifying political clash, which advanced like a steamroller over the entire nation mourning. Would you ever go into politics? Never. My role is different, and it possible only because I’m not a politician. If I were to run for office it wouldn’t be the same. Do you get tired of being the person who has to comment on Italian crime and corruption? [Laughs] Yes. It tires me to the point where I sometimes feel hopeless. I never manage to stay distant, so I’ve suffered a lot. I would sometimes like to not be who I am any more, to have a decent life, but I do it – some people think out of ambition, others narcissism – for honour. A word that fascists have plundered from us. For me, it an honour to fight those who are running the greatest defamatory campaign of recent years, against migrants. I do it knowing full well that it generates hatred, isolation, contempt. There no advantage: the easiest thing would be to stay quiet. But I go on. Which writers or investigative journalists do you admire most? I have a great respect for Turkish journalist Can Dündar. He was arrested for revealing in his newspaper [ Cumhuriyet ] that Erdogan was secretly taking part in the war in Syria. I followed Daphne Caruana Galizia work, and I’m friends with her sons. In life she was systematically vilified, and in death, the same people started to retract, to speak of a person full of dignity and courage. I’m on the side of whoever, when they write, knows they will pay a price – losing happiness, often freedom – but continues to write. What do you think of Elena Ferrante representation of Naples? Our cities are both protagonists of our books – Naples is never just a backdrop. But I’m not interested in telling the world about Naples, rather the world through Naples. The relationship dynamics in Ferrante works are emotional, so readers recognise themselves in them; I’m obsessed by how humans are crushed by power. That our difference. Elena Ferrante provided an endorsement for this book – something she never done – and it immediately generated interest. In America they asked me, how come Ferrante gave you this endorsement? 'These stories are our defence against organised crime': the mafia on film In May you said the UK was the most corrupt country in the world . Do you still think so? Absolutely. I’m not sure why, but the UK thinks of itself as not particularly corrupt. It doesn’t have a political class that more corrupt than South America or Italy, and it doesn’t have a more corrupt police force than Greece or Morocco. But it the country with the dirtiest capital in the world. Because London has no financial rules: money laundering is the primary source of British financial wealth – the money from Russian or South American coke. And it all legal. Maybe that why Britain doesn’t see it as particularly shameful – creating an economic system substantially based on the absence of financial regulation. It doesn’t matter if it blood money, from arms trafficking, from drugs. When I spoke about this in the UK, the perception was that it was something marginal. What do you like most about Italy? An Italian would normally answer “food”, with pride. But, rather than food, I want to say that it Italy humanist tradition, knowing how to spend time together. We’re a country of emigrants. Every year the equivalent of the population of Verona leaves; the south of Italy is almost uninhabited. Italy can only be reborn from migrants, allowing the Mediterranean to have a single citizenship. I’m much closer to the writers of Tunis than London, Algiers than Berlin. It an aberration, that the south, the heart of the Mediterranean, can’t be a shared territory. Maybe that what I was saying: this capacity to be convivial. This is an Italian quality that rancour, Salvini, and the hell we’re living in still haven’t erased.",1621,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/26/roberto-saviano-interview-gomorrah-piranhas
48,"Winnie M Li Dark Chapter is the winner of this year Not the Booker prize. It was the voting public favourite, and our judges concurred. Coming into the final round, Dark Chapter was the clear favourite with its victory in readers’ polling meaning it had two votes to take into the final round. Here how the public vote played out: Dark Chapter by Winnie M Li review – a defiant retelling of personal trauma Dark Chapter by Winnie M Li Man With a Seagull on His Head by Harriet Paige The Threat Level Remains Severe by Rowena Macdonald Not Thomas by Sara Gethin Anything Is Possible by Elizabeth Strout (Thanks to the excellent lljones for tallying and verifying those votes.) But even though Dark Chapter was ahead, the final choice was not clear cut. Our judges also had one vote each – and two of them favoured Harriet Paige Man With a Seagull on His Head. They shared my general opinion that this book is beautifully written, engaging and strange. It fell to our third judge, Hannah Bruce Macdonald, to make a case for Dark Chapter as the book that had stayed with her the longest. She argued that it wasn’t just an important and brave novel, it was also a story well told. All of our judges were admirably civil, but Hannah must have felt some pressure as we interrogated what prizes are for and how we define literary merit. She stood firm and made effective and persuasive arguments. As a result, we have a worthy and powerful winner. The only pity is that we could only choose one book. This was an excellent year and the other four books on our shortlist were excellent contenders. Commiserations are due to them all. Our winner, meanwhile, deserves hearty congratulations.",299,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/16/not-the-booker-prize-2017-winner
49,"This year Not the Booker prize is over. We have a winner: Kate Atkinson Life After Life . The first thing to say is that the prize has gone to a very good book. Atkinson is a tremendously talented writer and it quite right that she gets some recognition. The second – and possibly more interesting – thing to say is that although it is a valid and clear winner it was neither my choice, nor was it the choice of the public as decided by popular vote. To deal with the vote first of all. It has been going on for all of the last week and broke down as follows: Kate Atkinson: Life After Life – Neil Gaiman: The Ocean At The End Of The Lane – Lucy Cruickshanks: The Trader of Saigon – Suzie Tullett: Little White Lies and Butterflies – Meike Ziervogel: Magda – Zoe Venditozzi: Anywhere Better Than Here – The clear winner of the popular vote then, was Zoe Venditozzi Anywhere Better Than Here . But that wasn't enough to get it over the final hurdle. Under this year voting system, there were a maximum of five points that each book could receive – one from popular vote, three from our judging panel, and my own casting vote should no decision have emerged. Our panel decided to overrule the public. Briefly, in case you haven't been following the earlier rounds, this panel was made up of blogger and book reviewer Simon Savidge , writer and researcher Simon Moore and TV producer Victoria James . We chose them because they have clearly read each book on the shortlist extremely carefully. They have also provided intelligent and insightful comments on each one during the earlier stages of the competition. We care about the public vote. Maybe next year we should even weight it slightly more strongly, so that there more at stake in the voting round and so that the judges have to fight even harder to go against popular opinion. That an interesting discussion we can have in the comments. But for now, the important thing to say is that I had every confidence in the three judges, and that they gave very valid reasons for not choosing Zoe Venditozzi this time. And I write ""this time"" because the other important thing they all said is that Anywhere Better Than Here is a very promising book from a very talented writer. It might not have worked in the last or so pages, but this novel does show that Venditozzi will produce something very good soon. The panel also overruled me. My role in this debate was to stay pretty neutral, but I expect that it obvious from watching the film (and it clearly obvious from reading my reviews of each book) that my favourite was Magda by Meike Ziervogel . For me, this was by far the most intense, impressive and unexpected book on the shortlist. It the one that provoked the strongest emotional and intellectual reaction and more simply seemed to me to be the best written. But that by-the-by. I'm happy to be out-argued by our eloquent panel. When it boiled down to the final choice, Simon Moore made a very good case for Magda (while conceding that Life After Life was a quality novel) while Simon Savidge and Victoria James both gave strong reasons for preferring Atkinson. So I didn't have to use my casting vote. Life After Life got two points, Magda one and Anywhere Better Than Here one. So Life After Life bagged it. It may not have won the popular vote, but it remains a triumph for a different kind of democracy and a very worthy winner of the Not The Booker prize. Well done Kate Atkinson – Guardian headquarters will be sending off your cup soon. But it isn't quite over yet. The important thing now is to find out what you made of things. It wouldn't be the Not the Booker if we didn't hotly debate every stage after all. So was this the right winner? Were we right to overrule the popular vote? And how do you think our new panel system played out? Same again next year? Or do you have any new suggestions?

50,"Well that was fun! But I’ll save my analysis for later. I know how annoying it is to have to wade through a lot of jaw-jaw before an important announcement. Let just get down to it. The winner of the Not the Booker Prize is: Simon Sylvester The Visitors. Throughout this competition, The Visitors has had fervent support . Dozens, if not hundreds of people have spoken about how much they enjoyed this book and how much it moved them. It been a very impressive showing. This commitment was replicated in the public vote , where the Visitors blasted most of the opposition out of the water. Most, that is, but not all. As usual, the voting was frenetic, delightful and confusing. Among the hundreds of passionate tributes to the books on our shortlist there were also dozens of voters who hadn’t quite grappled with our requests and strictures about writing capsule reviews for each book. All that made knowing how to count a complicated business. In the final reckoning, Tony Black The Last Tiger got slightly more votes (a mighty to a pretty impressive However, if we went along with the letter of the law and only counted reviews with a decent word count, things came out roughly to in The Visitors’ favour. Since it was so close, and since you the public are allotted two votes in our complicated voting system, we decided to split them down the middle. Meaning that both Tony Black and Simon Sylvester took a vote each into the judging round. You can see how that judging went here: To summarise: our judges notched one vote for Mahesh Rao excellent The Smoke Is Rising and two for Simon Sylvester. The Last Tiger was liked and admired – but crucially two of our judges were sure that The Visitors was more impressive atmospherically and worked better as a complete, polished novel. And that was that. I’m sure the maths experts have already worked out that The Last Tiger took one vote, The Smoke Is Rising one vote, and The Visitors three, leaving us with a clear and very worthy winner. Donna Tartt didn’t even get a look-in – although I imagine she’ll manage just fine without us. So there you have it. An excellent year, I’d say. There were at least four books on the shortlist that I was very pleased to read. Time will tell if their authors go on to such lofty heights as past Not the Booker contenders like Lars Iyer , Lee Rourke , and Benjamin Myers , but at this stage I’m feeling happy. I’d also say that this year was possibly the smoothest, least fractious and most amicable we’ve had so far. That not to say that there hasn’t been controversy and excitement. The supporters of Louis Armand and Cairo provided a storm all of their own which added some salt to the stew. They made things more entertaining for everyone and I’m grateful. My review of First Time Solo was also strongly rejected by a number of commenters who put forward excellent and bracing arguments about how we should assess a book quality. The discussion has been vigorous and strong, in other words, which is just the way we like it. I’m also feeling good about the voting system. It went astonishingly smoothly, give or take a little confusion about what should and shouldn’t count. I think we now have a system we can take into next year without too much tinkering. Although, of course, we reserve the right to add a little bit of chaos to the equation. I’m looking forward to it already!

51,"Let have no ado at all. We have a winner: Fishnet by Kirstin Innes. Our judges split their individual votes three ways, but with two votes from the popular vote and one vote from the judges, Fishnet emerged as a clear winner. Here how things broke down. In the online round, eligible votes stood at: Fishnet by Kirstin Innes : Things We Have In Common by Tasha Kavanagh : The Good Son by Paul McVeigh : The Artificial Anatomy Of Parks by Kat Gordon : Shame by Melanie Finn : A Moment More Sublime by Stephen Grant : Dark Star by Oliver Langmead : Statistically this meant that Fishnet carried two votes through to the judging round. Morally, the three top books were incredibly close. A lot depended on the judges’ decision. I was worried that I might even have to use my casting vote – and wasn’t keen to do so, since I couldn’t choose between the three top books. I’d have been happy to see any one win. At the risk of trotting out a worn cliche, I have to say that it a shame that they can’t all be winners – the public vote provided an excellent top three. In fact, each novel on our shortlist this year had something to recommend it. There wasn’t a stinker among them, and there was a lot of very impressive writing. But, of course, a decision did have to be made. Fortunately, we had three excellent judges to do the job . In the event, Benjamin Judge opted for Shame, Alexandra Masters opted for The Good Son and Lorraine Berry for Fishnet. This meant that Fishnet had three votes out of five and my life was considerably easier. We had a winner – and one that everyone could agree to be an excellent choice. Fishnet is a fine novel. It possibly wasn’t the most polished and complete literary work on the list, but there is some excellent writing in there, as well as real emotional and political urgency. It gripping, it humane and it the kind of novel that can actually make you investigate your own prejudices and opinions. I know it challenged a few of my ideas about prostitution and the vulnerability (or otherwise) of sex workers. When I wrote about it earlier , I even said that I thought it was important. Immediately afterwards, I had a pang of doubt. Had I gone too far? Can a novel like this one really make a difference? Now that a few weeks have passed and I’ve seen the reactions of other readers to the book, I’d stand by those words. It a book that really moves people and really makes them think. It feels like a novel that has the potential to make a difference to a lot of lives – if only enough people read it. Hopefully this victory will help to make that possible. I hope that this book is spread far and wide – and I’m proud to have been involved in a prize that can ignite that process. I’m looking forward to competition already.

52,"Tiffany McDaniel The Summer That Melted Everything is the winner of this year Not the Booker prize. It was a popular choice not just with the voting public who backed it by a wide margin, but also with our judges. After the public vote, we had a clear leader: The Summer That Melted Everything by Tiffany McDaniel . Thirty or so votes behind that there was Deborah Andrews’ Walking the Lights . And then there was a difference of almost a hundred votes before we got to Jemma Wayne Chains of Sand , Louis Armand The Combinations , Dan Micklethwaite The Less Than Perfect Legend of Donna Creosote , and Dan Clements’ What Will Remain . Poor old “none of the above”, our extra voting category for this year came in behind them all with just five votes. Tiffany McDaniel: Deborah Andrews: Jemma Wayne: Louis Armand: Dan Micklethwaite: Dan Clements: None of the above: So, Tiffany McDaniel was ahead. And – appropriately enough – the red hot favourite. The winner of the public vote carries forward two points into the final round, and each judge also has a point to allot. As the video shows, all of our judges had Tiffany McDaniel novel in their top three. And one marked it first, meaning The Summer That Melted Everything scored a comfortable three, and there can be no doubts. It wasn’t my personal favourite on the shortlist , but the fact that I was so easily and comprehensively overruled demonstrates the democratic nature of our prize. It the readers who decide and Tiffany McDaniel has done an excellent job of winning them over. Kudos to her. All that remains for me to do here is to thank everyone who took part. It been another fantastic year for robust comment and discussion, and I’m grateful to the many people who read the books so well and made it all so interesting.

54,"John Cunliffe, who has died aged said he was inspired to create Postman Pat by his work for Wooler mobile library in Northumberland. “Like Pat, I travelled around a rural area and met a great many farmers and other rural dwellers who were kind and generous in the way that the people of Greendale are,” he recalled. “It was all there, in my memory.” Kindness and generosity, together with selflessness and community spirit, were virtues worth celebrating in the autumn of as the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, entered her second year in office. In the first episode, Postman Pat Finding Day, its hero was tasked with delivering birthday parcels to the twins Katie and Tom Pottage. So Pat set off in his red Royal Mail van (licence plate: with his black and white cat, Jess, in the passenger seat. This was decades before the Royal Mail sell-off and long before British streets became clogged with rival FedEx, UPS and Amazon vans. After delivering the presents, Pat discovered Katie tearful over losing her doll, Sarah-Anne. So he undertook to look for the doll on his route. Maybe she had left it in the church, suggested Reverend Timms; he and Pat scoured the pews, only to find Dorothy Thompson missing glove, which Pat returned to Ms Thompson – who in turn found Ted Glenn knife, which Pat returned to Mr Glenn, who found Miss Hubbard watch. After Pat had returned all this lost property, he decided to buy chocolates from Sam mobile shop for Katie, to cheer her up. Behind the chocolate box on the shelf he found the doll. Order was restored and Pat got a slice of birthday cake as a reward. Many of the episodes of Postman Pat were similarly fond depictions of a community-spirited world that seemed to be fast disappearing. As a result, Cunliffe creation became hugely popular worldwide: the television programmes were broadcast in countries and more than books were sold. Prince William carried Pat thermos flask to school. Before being broadcast in Japan, the usually four-fingered Postman Pat puppet was given an extra finger so he did not resemble a member of the local Yakuza crime organisation, who sometimes have their digits cut off as an act of internal discipline. There were even satires: in Harry Enfield and Chums, for instance, the action was moved to Italy, the theme song reworked as opera and at the end a communist revolution in Greendale ends with Pat being shot by fascist soldiers. Pat McCarthy, a postman in the Scottish Highlands, who had a black and white cat called Roguey, was long believed by locals in Arisaig to be the inspiration for Postman Pat, but he wasn’t. Cunliffe called his character Pat because it “sounded nice”, adding: “It lovely when people identify with the series, but there no connection. There are a lot of postmen called Pat and a lot of black and white cats.” He was also frequently asked whether a pet cat could, in fact, ride loose in a Royal Mail van. Probably not, he reflected. Postman Pat came about in when Cunliffe was teaching at Castle Park primary school in Kendal, Cumbria. A parent of one of the schoolchildren, who knew that he wrote children books, said to him: “I heard a talk last night, given by a lady from the BBC. She said they were looking for new writers, for a new TV series. Why don’t you send her some of your books?” He did, and then met the BBC children TV producer Cynthia Felgate, who was looking for a new series for preschool children, set in the countryside. “What about having a postman as the central character?” he asked. Cunliffe brought Postman Pat to life on a black Triumph typewriter in the back bedroom of his house in Kendal. Initially he wrote stories and drew a map of his fictional village of Greendale, modelled on Longsleddale, a few miles from his home. His mother-in-law was the template for Mrs Thompson at Greendale Farm, and the phone book gave him other names. He also strolled down to No Greendale, the local post office, to do research vital for the creation of his fictional postmistress, Mrs Goggins. The real-life post office closed in but there is now a commemorative plaque outside to Cunliffe and his creation. At the time he created Pat, Cunliffe was lonely. His only child, Edward, was at boarding school and his wife, Sylvia (nee Thompson), was living miles away as a mature university student. Populating Greendale with happy people was a comfort. But, as he told Nick Davies of the Guardian in , there was another reason. As a boy at school in the Lancashire mill town of Colne he had been a punchbag for bullies. So when he wrote about his jovial country postman, Cunliffe was constructing a community where everyone was happy and no bullies broke anybody else spectacles. The BBC liked the stories and showed them to the animator Ivor Wood , who had made The Magic Roundabout, The Herbs, The Wombles and Paddington Bear. Wood agreed to turn Cunliffe stories into films for the BBC. Progess was slow – an animator on Postman Pat completed about seconds of footage each day. Cunliffe sold the rights to Wood company, Woodland Animations, but was disappointed by the tie-in merchandise that was later released, which he thought was tacky and too commercial. Woodland licensed nearly products including socks, pyjamas, jogging suits, cycle shorts and swimming trunks. It also distributed literature in which it described itself as “the originators of the famous television, video and book character”; at an awards ceremony when the show won a Golden Cassette for record-breaking sales of audio tapes, Wood, rather than Cunliffe, was praised as Pat creator. Cunliffe did not fight back. “Life too short for wrangles,” he said. “On to the next exciting project!” That was called Rosie and Jim, a television series about two rag dolls who live on a Birmingham canal boat and come alive when no one is looking. The series was broadcast between and on ITV, and this time Cunliffe contribution was demonstrable. He appeared in the first episodes, playing the boat first owner, a bearded chap called Fizzgog. Cunliffe was born in Colne. He told interviewers that his father disappeared around the time he was born. His mother, a shop worker, could barely earn enough to keep them in food and clothes, so they had to board with his aunt and uncle. It was Uncle Herbert who introduced him to books, telling him about Shakespeare and Dickens and the wonderful universe of the imagination where life could be whatever you wanted it to be. It was a universe into which Cunliffe often retreated. He worked first as a librarian and then as a teacher, and his first book, Farmer Barnes Buys a Pig, was published in In all he wrote about books for children, including picture books and five volumes of poetry. He also wrote a play, The Twelve Days of Christmas, that was staged by Hull Truck Theatre in In he released Ghosts, a children story for the iPad, and saw a movie version of Postman Pat. Cunliffe spent his later life in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, and is survived by Sylvia and Edward.

55,"Following in the footsteps of fellow children book luminaries Bob Dylan, Keith Richards and Madonna, Paul McCartney is to write his own picture book. Hey Grandude follows an elderly, magical gentleman called Grandude and his adventures with his four grandchildren. “He calls them ‘Chillers’,” said McCartney, a grandfather to eight. “They love him and they go on adventures with him and he kind of magical, so you’ll see that in the book. I wanted to write it for grandparents everywhere – and the kids – so it gives you something to read to the grandkids at bed time.” Explaining the title, the former Beatle said: “I’ve got eight grandchildren and they’re all beautiful and one day one of them said to me ‘Hey Grandude!’. I said ‘What?’ and I thought, I kind of like that, so from then on I was kind of known as Grandude.” The picture book is set to be illustrated by Kathryn Durst, who said she was “thrilled” to work on the project. “I have wonderful childhood memories of my dad taking my siblings and me on exciting adventures, just like Grandude does in the book.” McCartney is the latest in a line of musicians to venture in to children publishing, with fellow former Beatle Ringo Starr and Rolling Stone Keith Richards also having released picture books with varying degrees of success. McCartney has previously put his name to children books before: he teamed up with author Philip Ardagh and illustrator Geoff Dunbar in to produce the ecological picture book High in the Clouds, which followed a squirrel called Wirral and his attempts to win back his woodlands from developers.

56,"The UK oldest prize for children literature, the Carnegie medal , has promised long-term change following a review of its lack of diversity, which one respondent said stemmed from the fact that “literature in the UK is an unapologetic bastion of white privilege”. All-white Carnegie medal longlist provokes anger from children authors The independent diversity review was prompted by outrage at the all-white, longlist for the Carnegie . The prize was established in but has never been won by a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) writer. Chaired by Dr Margaret Casely-Hayford, the review consulted more than people, from librarians to children, with researchers uncovering a lack of awareness of titles by authors of colour among librarians. The report also found there was a general lack of titles starring BAME characters or written by BAME authors being published, with a corresponding lack of visibility for the books that did feature BAME characters. The report pointed to the racial monotone of UK librarians – a survey of the workforce found that self-identify as white – as a possible influence on the Carnegie prize, which is judged by librarians. One respondent said: “There is bias – even though it may be unconscious – every step of the way. It is the responsibility of those with a voice in the publishing industry to seek out diverse books and help to create the awareness that will lead to change.” The Carnegie report follows a recent study from the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education, which found that only of the children books published in featured BAME characters, and just included a BAME main character. Casely-Hayford said it was “evident that the current state of diversity, representation and inclusion in children books must improve”, and that it was essential that the Carnegie and Kate Greenaway awards “embody the open, positive and inclusive spirit of libraries”. She made a series of recommendations for librarians’ association CILIP, which include expanding the diversity profile of the award judges, opening up the nominations process and raising members’ awareness of diverse books. She also recommended considering the inclusion of writing about different backgrounds as an indicator of quality. “It is critical that we get this right, and for the awards to truly and fully champion diversity, inclusion and representation. I am delighted that CILIP is taking this opportunity to offer children and young people the diverse literature they need and deserve to inspire them throughout their lives,” she said. By recognising diverse books and creators, she added, “the awards will increase the likelihood of more such books being published, giving more opportunity for them to be nominated, and increasing the likelihood of their being able to win prizes. This would create a virtuous circle with more such books being written, illustrated and published, creating a larger source of role models to inspire young readers to become future writers.” CILIP chief executive Nick Poole said the report “provides an opportunity to recognise and reinforce the message that width of diversity and quality are synonymous”. He said the body would be taking immediate action to address the report findings, including opening up its nominations process to external nominating bodies, bringing a “broader range of perspectives and experiences” to its judging panel, providing judges with diversity training and launching a quarterly publication promoting new authors. Poole added that children literature and illustration have “a unique power to shine a light on the world as it is and to help us to imagine a better one – and because of this we have an immense responsibility in how we develop and promote these awards as ethical librarians … I am pleased that we have been able to take action that will impact immediately, as well as looking ahead to long-term change.”",627,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/27/carnegie-medal-promises-immediate-action-over-lack-of-diversity
57,"here no more powerful way to silence someone than to call them crazy. This one word swiftly minimises a person anguish as something wrong with them, rather than an appropriate response to a malfunctioning society. These days, whenever a young person is brave enough to talk about their emotional distress, they’re called “snowflakes”. It dangerous abuse, and it needs to stop. My young adult novel about mental illness, Are We All Lemmings and Snowflakes? asks the question – are young people really overly sensitive, or is their suffering actually a by-product of an unkind world? I’ve been travelling to schools around the country, and talking to them about Compassion Focused Therapy , trying to free young people from their self-hatred and shame about their mental health problems. My lesson is clear and, I thought, pretty hard to argue with: if we were kinder to ourselves, and to each other, it might ease their suffering. However, last week I found myself on the receiving end of columnist Rod Liddle spite in the Times. He chose to mock my novel, which he does not seem to have read beyond the title, and my book launch event, which he didn’t attend. He misinterpreted my use of snowflake and gleefully ridiculed my call for us to be kinder. I’m not going to lie: I was initially shocked, humiliated and hurt. But, once I got my head around what had happened, my feelings turned to anger. What has the world come to when kindness is jeered at? To some degree, I can see why it is an easy target. It the word of the moment, which has inevitably led to it being co-opted by marketers; important ideas like self-care have been reduced to putting on a face mask. But real compassion is a lot more complicated than using a bath bomb or smiling more on the tube. It requires you to look at the darker aspects of your life, how they’ve shaped you, and to try to forgive yourself for any unhelpful coping mechanisms you’ve developed as a response to hardship. It takes bravery to be truly kind, especially to ourselves. It is much easier to label depressed or anxious people as overly sensitive, as that absolves us from any responsibility for their pain. UK survey finds sharp decline in happiness of young women and girls We’re in the midst of an epidemic. One in young people experience mental health problems – roughly three in every classroom. Happiness among young women has sharply declined over the last decade . Seventy-five per cent of mental illnesses start before a child birthday. Levels of self-harm are rocketing, with more than a quarter of young women admitting to deliberately hurting themselves . And young men are still more likely to kill themselves than die for any other reason . Mental illness does not exist in a vacuum, and we’ve got to ask, what the hell are we doing to young people that causing them so much hurt? The World Health Organisation says that mental disorders are inextricably linked to human rights issues, and proven risk factors are almost all symptoms of a failing society. These include: poverty, malnutrition, lack of education, fears of homelessness, bullying, and exposure to violence and discrimination. More than half of young women with mental health problems have experienced some kind of abuse. I’ve been trying to explain to young people that it not crazy to be depressed or anxious if you’ve been abused, bullied, or come from a family struggling to make ends meet. If you look at the hardships young people are up against, is it any wonder they’re struggling with their mental health? They’ve been told it almost impossible they’ll ever own a home, they face daily headlines promising the collapse of our economy or the devastating consequences of climate change. On top of all this, older generations add further insult to their despair, calling them snowflakes if they dare find any of this stressful. I refuse to let young people steep in shame for their totally appropriate responses to the world around them. Recently, our understanding of mental illness has begun to move away from purely biological models and towards one that considers the individual experience. Instead of asking, “What wrong with you?” we are finally asking, “What happened to you?” More people feel brave enough to share their stories and this should only be encouraged, never ridiculed. I’m inclined to wonder what happened to Liddle, to make him someone who sneers at those fighting to make the world a kinder, safer place for young people. But it’ll take someone braver than me to find compassion for him. I’m going to continue fighting for young snowflakes, and empowering them to share their stories. Together, we can create an avalanche and, hopefully, a world that doesn’t make people ill. I don’t think that such a crazy thought.

58,"I once lived in the house with a child of eight years-old. I was asked to tell him stories in the evenings, and I did. Or – I must be accurate – I told him one story. It was about a little boy called Tommy who was wrecked on a desert island. Being an intelligent boy, he built himself a hut out of the branches of a tree and made a useful fish-hook out of a pin which had been washed up after the wreck. The island was just what a desert island ought to be. It abounded in ripe bananas and coconuts. Fish swarmed round its coasts, and there were turtles on the strand – quiet turtles, very easy to turn. The few savages who inhabited the interior were timid creatures, and Tommy had no difficulty in chasing them away by blowing loud blasts on a horn which he made out of a sea-shell of peculiar shape. It was a good story, and I told it every evening for a week. Then I got tired of it and invented another about a little girl called Molly who was saved from a cruel stepmother by a friendly bear. It was a good story too, and the part about Molly life in the bear cave was thrilling. But I never got to that. I was ordered, without the least consideration of my feelings as an author, to go back to my story of Tommy on the island. I did; and for another week told it and nothing else. Then I became exceedingly tired of it and tried to break the monotony by varying the incidents. I introduced a friendly bird, half seagull, half hen, which laid eggs for Tommy. That fowl was a complete failure. “No,” said the child, the public of my later years, “not a bird, a turtle.” So I went back to the turtle. The artists' artist: children authors After a couple of months I could have told the story of Tommy on the island in my sleep; but carelessness and inattention – I admit both – bring their punishment. If I changed the order of the incidents, put the turning of the turtle before the discovery of the first banana, I was pulled up at once and reminded of the proper sequence of events. Now this child had an aunt called Matilda, and she told him stories – or rather one story – at times when I was not available. Her story was not the least like mine. It was about a pony, an old nurse, and a magic ring. But she had to stick to it as closely as I stuck to mine. She was not allowed either to change the plot or vary the incidents. After consulting together one day we tried the experiment of changing stories. I told hers and she told mine. We were met with howls of indignation. The Tommy-on-the-Island story was mine, and I must tell it. The Pony-Old-Nurse-Magic-Ring story was Aunt Matilda, and no one else must touch it. All that happened long ago, and since then both the aunt and I have told stories, in print, to grown-up people. We have both been moderately successful, though neither of us has ever produced a best-seller. We met last week and fell to talking about old times. We got back to our experiences with that child. “You remember,” I said, “how he kept us at it and would not let us change a word.” “It been the some ever since,” she said with a little sigh. “If you knew how sick I am of that story of mine about...” I have read it, of course. It is about a pretty fair-haired girl of aristocratic but impoverished family whose young man owned a racehorse which he rode himself, chiefly in steeplechases. There is another young man, less desirable than her young man, who also owns a racehorse. But I need not tell the story. Everybody has read it, ten or fifteen versions of it. “But,” I said, “that not your only story. There another. I remember it distinctly – about a man who had a yacht on the Mediterranean and met a foreign princess gambling at Monte Carlo.” “Yes,” said Aunt Matilda miserably. “And there was another about… But what the use of inventing them? Nobody’ll read them. Back I have to go to that infernal girl and the racehorse. I’ve broken the beast neck twice, but I’ve had to resurrect him. The public ignores me if I write about anything else. Now you “– here she looked at me enviously – “you can drift about anything you like.’’ “No, I can’t,” I said. “The story they want from me is about an island off the West of Ireland, with buried treasure on it, and if I dare to write about anything else… I once tried a book about ghosts, ghosts which haunted a church – quite a novel kind. It took me nearly a year to find a publisher for it, and the public loathed it.” Will Self: ‘The novel is absolutely doomed’ “I remember it,” she said. “I didn’t actually loathe it, but…” “You prefer the treasure-buried-on-an-island story,” I said. “You like it over and over again.” “To be quite candid,” she said “I do.” “Well, then,” I said vindictively, as we are being candid I may as well confess that I can’t read anything of yours except the girl-and-racehorse story.” “Child!” she retorted. “You are just as much a child as that little nephew of mine used to be.” I suppose I am. But so is she. So are the reviewers who get angry with us if we attempt anything we have not done a dozen times before. There was one of them the other day who began a notice of my last story in this way: “For the first pages or so we were afraid that we were in for a story like one of Galsworthy or Stephen McKenna, but to our relief…” To his relief I moved off to the West of Ireland. But imagine the mentality of man. He was afraid he was going to get a book like Galsworthy – actually afraid! And the dear people, that great and kindly public which we all try to amuse, is just the same. Children all of them, with a child hatred of the smallest variation in a familiar tale. “Let rebel,” said Aunt Matilda. “Let both rebel simultaneously.” Before we parted we shook hands on a solemn promise. Her next novel is going to be about treasure buried on an island off the west coast of Ireland. Mine is going to be about a fair-haired girl of aristocratic but impoverished family whose young man owns a race-horse. We shall keep that promise, but if we find publishers for those novels (which is very unlikely) we shall both have to commit suicide afterwards, for life will be intolerable. George A.

59,"A home video of a Scottish grandmother uncontrollable giggles while reading The Wonky Donkey picture book to her baby grandson have sent book lovers around the world rushing to get their hands on a copy, with publishers left scrambling to meet demand. New Zealander Craig Smith children book, based on Smith song of the same name, tells of a three-legged – or wonky – donkey, adding a new adjective every few pages until it ends with a “spunky, hanky-panky cranky stinky dinky lanky honky-tonky winky wonky donkey”. In a recent video made by her daughter , Scottish granny Janice Clark reads the story to her four-month-old grandson Archer, and laughs progressively harder as the donkey becomes increasingly bizarre. “Oh dear, how can anybody read this seriously,” says Clark. “This is going to kill me.” The video has been viewed more than times in the last week. Smith told the Guardian that demand had “gone through the roof” for the picture book since the video of Clark took off: in New Zealand, his publisher is “rushing to print another copies, with a view for more”, while The Wonky Donkey is now also being reprinted in the UK. Amazon in the US and the UK has sold out, while used bookseller AbeBooks said that it has sold “hundreds of copies” of The Wonky Donkey in the last week, amid “massive demand” around the world. Although the picture book, which is illustrated by Katz Cowley, had sold more than copies around the world to date, the majority of that was in Australia and New Zealand, said Smith, who hopes it will find a more global readership. “The video is gold. Watching Janice read and laugh was just delightful, and like many, her infectious laugh had me laughing too,” said Smith. “I’ve always wondered why sales had not taken off so much in the UK and US, but that looks like that about to change.” Cowley said that while The Wonky Donkey has been a household name in Australia and New Zealand since it was first published in the book had been only “an underground success” in the UK. “I am so glad that Wonky reputation has finally come to bite him on the bum on this side of the world thanks to ‘Wonky Guardian Granny’. I couldn’t be more delighted,” Cowley said, calling Clark “a reminder in life, when all else fails, to fall about laughing. She has a spirit like Wonky.” At Hachette, which publishes the book in the UK, group picture book director Emma Layfield said the publisher had already seen a “well-deserved jump in demand” for the book, “especially in Scotland”. “It delightful to see the infectious appeal of Wonky Donkey spread around the globe. The video is a fantastic demonstration that the best picture books entertain the whole family, not just the kids,” said Layfield.",476,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/10/the-wonky-donkey-viral-video-of-grandmother-makes-picture-book-a-bestseller
60,"here are a few books for children that operate as a type of personality test. One is The Wind in the Willows : every person is a Ratty, a Mole, a Toad or a Badger. Another is Rudyard Kipling The Jungle Book : in each of us is a constellation of Baloo, Bagheera, Mother Wolf, Kaa and Shere Khan: the book is a kind of Myers Briggs personality test for the childhood soul. Many, perhaps most, people first come to The Jungle Book through the Disney animation. There a great deal to admire about the film, but it a very different beast; Walt Disney famously gave one of his screenwriters a copy of the book, saying: “The first thing I want you to do is not to read it.” The film is sunlit; the book is darker, sly and knowing where the Disney is optimistic, written with human venality full in mind. As a child I was drawn to the bookprecisely because it did not attempt to convince me that we are better than we are and thereby wrangle me indirectly into good behaviour. Mowgli was what I knew, at the age of eight, the best children were: stubborn, boastful, loving, egotistical, loyal, brave and wild. You wouldn’t necessarily like Mowgli were you to meet him on a bad day, but you would not be able to ignore how intensely alive he was. When I was asked to write a book set in the world of Kipling Jungle Book , I accepted with alacrity, despite knowing that Kipling would probably loathe the idea of someone else playing with his work, and given what we know of his politics, I would not be his first choice. Nor would he be mine; as a supporter of the British empire and of theBoer war, in which thousands died in concentration camps, Kipling is a deeply troubling figure, and was considered controversial and difficult even by his contemporaries. But as with Richard Wagner, his characters have taken on a life that extends beyond the man himself. I accepted, because the desire to take up a story I have loved since I was eight years old was too strong to resist. I was not alone. There has been, in the last decade or so, a spate of writers taking on the classics of children literature. Some have re-entered the original fictional world; Pamela Butchart , known for her ludic, joyfully unhinged The Spy Who Loved School Dinners , has just published a Secret Seven story, set in the same time and place as Enid Blyton original; Hilary McKay Wishing for Tomorrow is the story of Miss Minchin Select Seminary after the events of A Little Princess have passed, and the multi-award winning novelist Geraldine McCaughrean won a competition, run by Great Ormond Street Hospital, to write an “official sequel” to JM Barrie Peter and Wendy . Others have modernised existing stories. Jacqueline Wilson Katy , a present day version of What Katy Did , reshapes the ending so that Katy does not throw off her spinal injury when she has learned grace and sweetness. Frank Cottrell Boyce Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again takes only Chitty itself from Ian Fleming original text and reintroduces the car into a modern family. Writing inside a much-loved story is, inevitably, a daunting job, though Cottrell Boyce task was possibly made less so by the fact that he is an exceptional writer for children and Fleming, for all his talents elsewhere, was quite markedly not. The original book is surprisingly sparse and blunt; most of the lunatic details that make the film such a strange, vertiginous triumph – the Child Catcher, Lionel Jeffries erratic Grandpa Potts – were added by Roald Dahl , who co-wrote the screenplay. It may be that behind the boom lies a desire to save the old stories, which are read less and less every generation, from dying out and to inject them with new life; it might be, less nobly, a desire to take control, as an adult, of that which one coveted as a child – it has a touch of megalomaniacal glee in it. The fashion coincides with the explosion of fanfiction across the internet. Beginning with Star Trek fandom in the it rapidly expanded to include both classic and modern fiction. The cliche is that the majority of fanfiction is lovingly described sexual liaisons between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, but it extends into every genre, and is at once an act of homage and an appropriation of narrative power. It is evidence that fiction, despite the stringent legalities of copyright, is a slippery beast, and cannot belong to anyone. I did not expect writing my way into the world of the jungle to be easy. In part, I was dogged by fear of other people fury; The Jungle Book is part of the cultural landscape, and Mowgli is not mine, nor Kipling, but common property. My book Into the Jungle is a series of origin stories for each of the main animal characters, and, for some, the backstory I have imagined for Bagheera will be sacrilege. More, though, the job was difficult because children fiction is, at its best, so strange. Its logic often arrives sideways. Britain, unlike Russia and France, is still inclined to treat children fiction as if it were something sweet and slim, akin to producing watercolour paintings of kittens; at its best, though (and its best is, of course, necessarily rare), it is a way of distilling the frenetic wildness of the untrammelled human imagination into something witty, sharp, generous, shrewd and honest. I was faced with the fact that The Jungle Book , and particularly its narrative voice, is so strange as to be inimitable. Kipling narrator in the novel sounds constantly on the edge of irritation: wry, wary, caustic. This he shared with JM Barrie , whose voice is ruthless to the point of cruelty (the Darling children mother is dismissed in a single line: “Mrs Darling was now dead and forgotten”), and, to a lesser extent, CS Lewis. Kipling language was self-consciously archaic even for as if to align the stories with fables and myths. It felt foolhardy to try to mimic Kipling voice, where mimicry could so swiftly descend into pastiche; so I attempted to keep the voices of the animals recognisably their own and the surrounding narration as simple as possible. It was a valuable lesson to be reminded of; looking at children fiction of the past, it is the characters that endure. Fictional characters, though, do not grow and evolve as children grow and times evolve, and to return to old stories is frequently to face the conflict of wanting to cherish stories that contain elements intensely unpleasant to a contemporary eye. Tintin, for instance, is at once loyal, brave, witty and, in places, unambiguously racist. Georges Remi, alias Hergé , the inventor of Tintin, wrote for a Belgian wartime newspaper, Le Soir, which collaborated with the Nazi occupiers; in one story from that period, The Shooting Star , Tintin battles against a hook-nosed Jewish financier called Blumenstein. Roald Dahl, in an interview with the New Statesman in stated that “even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick [Jewish people] for no reason”. To read the children fiction of the and centuries is to ask if it possible to love aspects of a character or an author and reject those parts we cannot love, without ignoring or forgetting their existence. One potential way through is proposed by Philip Ardagh , who has made amendments to Hugh Lofting The Story of Doctor Dolittle for the Macmillan Collector Library edition. The book is yet to be published; some will believe it is editing away the very history to which we should be vigilant; others will think it restores the book as a text that children can revel in. Children fiction, as the place in which hearts and minds are shaped, can be highly charged; the secret garden does not grow in primary colours. Although we appear to live in a time when there is a passion for the reinvention of classics and a desire to keep the old stories alive, there is nothing new in the desire to take on another ideas and twist them. Milton Paradise Lost took flamboyant liberties with the voice of Satan, and could be posited as the first piece of long-form fanfiction. In Nahum Tate rewrote Shakespeare King Lear , deleting the Fool entirely and creating an ending in which Cordelia and Edgar are married off, to mass jubilation. In the mid century the poet Katherine Philips, a prominent woman of letters in her day, took extracts from several of John Donne love poems and made them her own in “To the Excellent Mrs Anne Owen”. Philips passionately addresses a female companion, harnessing Donne eroticism while maintaining, by using borrowed imagery, the deniability necessary for propriety: her use of Donne allowed her freedom. The same impulse to borrow, build, add and reshape runs richly through other mediums: Jacques Loussier jazz renditions of Bach pull together Bach symmetries and jazz spontaneous irregularities to make something at once new and recognisable. Matthew Bourne dance production The Car Man takes the music from Bizet Carmen and turns it into a tale of desire in century America. Rewriting can also, of course, be a form of righting textual wrongs. Several children, working on the Nahum Tate model, have sent me alternative endings to my book Rooftoppers , when they found the original insufficiently definite. And, many years ago, having long found the ending of Little Women unconscionable, I wrote a new one. Ultimately, though, I wanted to write my way into The Jungle Book because there has always, since I was young, been more I wanted to know, and nobody to tell me – and I believed that other children may have felt the same. I wanted to know more about the side-lined female characters; what made Mother Wolf so ferocious? I wanted to know how the many languages of the jungle worked; I wanted to know what was at the heart of Bagheera enigmatic silences. Writing within another writer world feels, at its root, like a form of exploration. At its best, it is a moment of reaching out, drawing a work from one time into another, one medium into another and attempting, in that moment, to build something at once old and new, to connect that world with this.

61,"No The Family from One End Street by Eve Garnett The Family from One End Street marked a series of firsts for me. Perhaps most importantly, it was the first book to break the stranglehold of Enid Blyton. Much as I loved the billion volumes of Famous Five et al, the day eventually dawned when I started running a speculative eye over library and shop shelves for stories about something other than the spy-catching quintet. And there, suddenly, were the Ruggles family — two parents, seven children — all rendered equally lively and interesting but all utterly different from each other, and all utterly real. Episodically structured, it became therefore the first book I loved for its characters rather than its plot. And it was the first book not only for me, but for all of its readers when it was first published in to make urban, working-class children its heroes. Some critics detected a patronising tone towards Garnett characters, but others praised her for avoiding both sentimentality and condescension and replacing them with what one called ""a careful truthfulness"" instead. Not that I knew or cared about any of this at the time, of course. I just knew it was a relief to spend time with book-children who, like me, had more experience of a world bounded by building sites, patches of grubby parkland and knackered working parents than they did of one strewn with rolling moors, private islands and spies. It was also the first book I owned that had been written and illustrated by the author. Garnett had been an art student and the book grew out of her walks through the back streets of London as she searched for subjects to sketch. Incidentally, the drawings are lovely — sweet, strong and deceptively simple, like the book itself. But better even than the book was this: it had a sequel. Two, in fact: The Further Adventures of the Family from One End Street, and Holiday at the Dew Drop Inn, which were, if you can believe it, even better. This gave me a wholly misguided sense of life as a process of cumulative improvement, which would take several painful years of experience to dispel, but on the plus side, Holiday at the Dew Drop Inn gave me my first understanding of just how deep the pleasures of reading could run. It was as if, with the story of Kate Ruggles' summer-long stay at the eponymous hostelry and enthusiastic embrace of village life, Eve Garnett had peered into my mind and written down exactly what she knew would delight me most. That seemed to me magic of the highest order and I raced off to other shelves to find it again.",453,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/06/family-from-one-end-street
62,"JM Barrie might be most famous for his classic story of a flying boy who never grows up, but the author was also far ahead of his time when it came to cognitive psychology, according to a Cambridge academic who argues in a new book that the Peter Pan author whimsical stories deliberately explore the nature of cognition. Neuroscientist Rosalind Ridley, of Newnham College in Cambridge, claims in the just-published Peter Pan and the Mind of JM Barrie that the author work identifies key stages of child development. One scene she spotlights in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, published in sees a girl giving a tearful Peter her handkerchief, which he is confused by. “So she showed him, that is to say she wiped her eyes, and then gave it back to him, saying: ‘Now you do it,’ but instead of wiping his own eyes he wiped hers, and she thought it would be best to pretend that this is what she had meant,” writes Barrie. According to Ridley, Barrie is here illustrating his observation and understanding of a fundamental stage of child development: having a “theory of mind”, or the ability to understand that one knowledge, beliefs and feelings may not be the same as someone else. This is learned naturally by most children around the age of three or four, but the term was not used until the late In psychologists would show that failure to employ theory of mind is a symptom of autism, Asperger syndrome and some psychiatric conditions. Other apparently fanciful ideas included in Barrie Peter Pan stories include Peter lack of understanding of hide and seek, and his inability to comprehend what emotional love is. “These whimsical ideas comprise deliberate errors of cognition, that is to say, errors in the way we normally structure our thoughts, leading to the suspicion that Barrie was deliberately exploring the nature of cognition in these stories,” writes Ridley in the book, newly out from Cambridge Scholars Publishing . “Barrie whimsicalities serve to compare the cognitive abilities of babies, children, and fairies (who represent children imagination) to those of adult humans. He is demonstrating that children need to develop cognitively, that is to say, they need to acquire skills of thinking, rather than that they are little adults who need merely to acquire factual information in order to grow up. He was very forward thinking in this respect and much of his motivation seems to have been a plea for a greater understanding of the mental and emotional needs of children.” Cognitive psychology, she writes, was in its infancy when Barrie was writing, and “in many cases, his accurate observation of animal and human behaviour precedes the analysis of these behaviours by the scientific community”. Calling Barrie a “naturalist of the mind”, she shows how he explores the nature of consciousness, from closely observed details about human behaviour such as contagious yawning (Wendy “light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also”), to the important role of sleep in consolidating and rationalising memory, which Barrie compares to “tidying drawers”: “When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.” As a modern psychologist, I could see things that I knew hadn’t been ‘discovered’ until the It was remarkable Dr Rosalind Ridley Ridley told the Guardian that, on reading Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens as an adult and applying her academic experience as a neuroscientist, she found Barrie prescience “quite extraordinary”. “As a modern psychologist, I could see things in it that I knew hadn’t been ‘discovered’ until I was a student, or in the It was quite remarkable,” she said. “I read up about it, and although there was a lot about Peter Pan, who an iconic figure, and people talked about Barrie interest in children, I really found very little about cognitive psychology.” She concluded that the work of Charles Darwin had been a pivotal influence on Barrie work. “At that time, animals were thought of as beasts, there was a big gap between humans and animals. And then along came Darwin, showing us that we were animals mentally as well as physically. I think Barrie is completely suffused with this,” she said. “I’ve thought a great deal about what his motivation was, and I’m convinced he was doing it on purpose. Some of the quirky whimsicalities appear more than once: he seems to be making a point. A little version of [the girl with the handkerchief story] appears two to three times. He must have known it was weird, and interesting, and that it meant something. He wasn’t being trivial.” The stories of Peter Pan were created by Barrie between and to amuse the boys of the Llewelyn Davies family, whom Barrie had met while walking in Kensington Gardens, and whose guardian he later became when their parents died. Ridley said that the tale of a boy who never grows up is also linked to Barrie tragic childhood: the author elder brother died in a skating accident when he was a child. “A lot of it is to do with reshaping his childhood. So he personally motivated, but is also scientifically motivated. In those days, they thought of children as being tiny people with no knowledge, that all you had to do was educate them. Barrie is making out that tiny children are more animal-like,” she told the Guardian. ‘We longed for Peter Pan to come for us: what could be more exciting?’ In her book, she shows how the narrative of Peter Pan works on different levels. It is a coming-of-age story, a fantasy for children and adults, and the myth of a golden age, but was also invented by the author “essentially for himself in order to explore and perhaps make some sense of his own emotional difficulties, to investigate the interplay of the world of facts and the world of the imagination and to rediscover the heightened experiences of infancy”. “In the process,” she writes, “he created a work of genius.”",1038,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/02/peter-pan-was-pioneering-work-of-child-psychology-claims-new-study
63,"hen I was DC Thomson advertised for material for a big new teenage magazine it was launching, which didn't yet have a name. I&nbsp;began contributing. My first article was about what it like to go to a posh dance and be the poor soul who doesn't get off with a boyfriend. It was done in a&nbsp;jokey style to try and make other girls who'd gone through this embarrassment laugh a little. I contributed various articles, and then they offered me a job in Scotland. I was expecting to be&nbsp;put to work on this teenage magazine, but when I arrived in late I was actually put on a&nbsp;very different women magazine instead. Because I was quite young, I had to report to the two guys in charge of women and teenage magazines every Friday. They were called Mr Cuthbert and Mr Tate – they sound like a musical team. One day, when I went along, they were chuntering about the new magazine and said, ""Did you know it going to be named after you?"" I stared at them blankly, and they said, ""Well, you&nbsp;wait and see."" Anyway, when the magazine came out in it was called Jackie . I don't know whether or not I was meant to take Mr&nbsp;Cuthbert or Mr Tate remark literally, but I&nbsp;did. However, I do believe that Gordon Small, the brilliant first editor of Jackie, has said that the name was a committee decision.

64,"Perhaps surprisingly, Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold, which is available on Netflix from October, is the first documentary about a writer whose body of work helped define and record American life, particularly during the restive and From the Manson murders and the Iran-Contra affair to the Salvadoran civil war and her own bereavement, Didion tackled them all with her signature lyricism and savvy. And for the actor Griffin Dunne, Didion nephew, finding a way to render that legacy in film was his tallest task. Donald Trump v Joan Didion? Now I’d watch that | Emma Brockes “The challenge was what can I say or show that she hasn’t already written?” Dunne, who recently starred in I Love Dick and House of Lies, said. “It was tremendous pressure making a film about someone I’m related to and care so deeply about.” The documentary takes a loosely chronological structure, but more than anything it arranged around Didion best-known writing. There are segments devoted to her reporting from the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco in the late as well as Didion political journalism from the her essay on the Central Park Five , the screenplay Panic in Needle Park, and her later autobiographical works, The Year of Magical Thinking and Blue Nights, both heart-wrenching voyages through Didion grief after the deaths of her husband and daughter. It was when Didion asked Dunne to shoot a short promotional video for that last book that Dunne asked for a favor in return: could he make a film about his aunt? “I realized there had never been a documentary about her, by her own choice, so I thought I’d push my luck and ask her if she’ll allow me to make one,” he said. “In typical Joan fashion, she went, ‘Uh, OK,’ and I took that as a yes. Then it really sunk in what an enormous subject I had taken on, how influential [her work] been on so many people lives, the way they live their lives or where they live or if they become a writer or not. So I felt a real obligation to her readers to get it right.” In order to do just that, Dunne reached out to those who had run in the same circle as Didion for decades, including the writer Calvin Trillin and her former editor Bob Silvers, of the New York Review of Books. There an appearance from Harrison Ford – who worked for Didion and her husband as a carpenter – and the Vogue editor Anna Wintour, the New Yorker critic Hilton Als, the actor Vanessa Redgrave and the playwright David Hare. The result is a comprehensive exploration of both Didion and the razor-sharp sensibility that catapulted her to literary stardom. As Als says in the film: “The weirdness of America somehow got into this person bones and came out on the other side of a typewriter.” I think Trump just bores her as a writer. He doesn’t have any subtext Griffin Dunne To Dunne, no piece exemplifies his aunt osmotic relationship with the chaos of mid-century America more than the title essay of her first book, Slouching Towards Bethlehem. “The way she can compartmentalize being a mother who is writing about displaced children during the height of the Summer of Love while other people are looking at hippies kissing and smoking pot,” he said. “She missing her own daughter while witnessing a five-year-old child tripping on acid that she been given by her parents. She recognized that as a golden opportunity for a journalist to report.” Given his lifelong proximity to her, part of Dunne motivation to make the documentary was the opportunity to introduce Didion fans to the woman he knows as Aunt Joan. “In researching and reading the criticism about her work, she always been painted as this mystic, gloomy figure, walking around the apartment thinking about death and having nervous breakdowns all day,” he said. “But she hilariously funny, she laughs a lot and loves to laugh, and she devoted.” Dunne got a taste of just how feverishly people would take to the film when he started a Kickstarter campaign three years ago to raise money for it. A teaser video gained traction and, within one day, the project reached a fundraising goal – but it wasn’t quite enough. Then, Netflix got onboard. “The reaction from the trailer went viral and it showed Netflix just what a hunger there was to see a movie like this. It confirmed that this particular writer has a passionate audience that was just dying to see it. I’ve never experienced that much anticipation for a movie I’ve been involved with.” Part of Didion eternal appeal, Dunne explains, is how inviting her writing is, a quality that manifests itself in pieces like The White Album and On Self-Respect, where it often seems like she working her thoughts out on the page, delicately spinning a web of whimsical prose and shrewd reporting. In the documentary, though, Didion, now keeps her answers short and sweet, exhibiting an economy of language readers will recognize from her work. “No one is going to accuse her of being a chatterbox,” he jokes. “She would answer sometimes with three words and then sit there in silence. I’ve grown to become comfortable in those silences because she is. When she finished saying what she wanted to say, she done.” South and West: From a Notebook by Joan Didion review – back to the future of the US Reading an essay like Inside Baseball, in which Didion picks apart the stagecraft of American politics through the framework of the presidential campaign, or Clinton Agonistes, a whip-smart inquiry into Bill Clinton impeachment proceedings, one wonders what she thinks about our current political maelstrom. After spending months by her side working on the documentary, Dunne, who was counseled by his uncle never to ask Didion about a piece she working on, knew the question was unavoidable. “We did talk about it a bit. When she was writing Inside Baseball, she would talk about the subversive messages that political leaders were trying to convey, and how the media was interpreting what was being said. She would see it in an entirely different way. That always been her strength as a writer, to not follow the hysteria of the mainstream. “I think Trump just bores her as a writer. He doesn’t have any subtext. There is no message that he trying to subvert. And she really, truly tires of him, of the reality TV aspect of how he conducts his leadership. So I think she just prefers to leave it to others.” While that may be a loss for us, the arrival of Dunne documentary, exactly years after the publication of his aunt most famous essay, Goodbye to All That, almost makes up for it.

65,"here a passage in Proust that offered useful guidance during meetings to judge this year Goldsmiths prize , about “artificial novelty” in a work of art being less effective than a repetition designed to reveal a new truth. (I imagine he implicitly defending his own method as a novelist.) What we were looking for – in a prize designed to reward the “genuinely novel” – wasn’t innovation as such, but writers able to take fresh possession of the form resources. Books that had strong advocates among the judges but couldn’t quite displace the six on our list have earned thanks for the pleasure they gave us – Jonathan Buckley The Great Concert of the Night , Jeremy Gavron Felix Culpa , Danny Denton The Earlie King &amp; The Kid in Yellow , Nick Harkaway mighty fantasy Gnomon . There have been novels in verse before, but the one we selected, Robin Robertson The Long Take , does a remarkable job of harnessing the dynamics of prose fiction and has a superb sense of time and place. The main character, a traumatised veteran of the second world war, sees the world collapsing around him a second time in the corporate destruction of Los Angeles as a liveable city. Cinephiles will particularly respond to the element of film noir, not a matter of vague atmosphere but specified shots, angles and film shoots. It not new to base a novel around a woman trying to make a success of a social occasion while other people fall apart, but this describes Olivia Laing Crudo as well as Mrs Dalloway. Laing Twitter-addicted narrator is getting married rather than throwing a party, but she much more aware of the fragility of her privilege, and collapse feels very near, even without the greedy, disruptive voice of Kathy Acker breaking through from page to page. Rachel Cusk Kudos is the final part of a trilogy, both of whose earlier parts were shortlisted in previous years, and it was clear to the judges that this vein of writing, undertaking a cool survey of the unbalanced present, is far from exhausted. In its early pages the book mentions the EU referendum campaign, but Kudos treats politics glancingly as a metaphor for the hidden inequalities within relationships and even the discontinuities within individuals – “the question of whether to leave or remain was one we usually asked ourselves in private”. It would be a stretch to compare Guy Gunaratne turbulent In Our Mad and Furious City with Faulkner As I Lay Dying, though you could make a case for an overlap since both use competing monologues to tell a tightly focused story. The great success of the book comes from Gunaratne ability to give the rawest of material a sophisticated treatment without denaturing it, lovingly notating the language of the streets and not restricting himself to the voices of a single gender, ethnicity or generation. There couldn’t be a greater contrast between Gunaratne book and the quiet unspooling of Gabriel Josipovici The Cemetery in Barnes , which shows the powerful effects that can be achieved without ever raising your voice. In one way this is the most “literary” of the books on the list, with its deceptively serene progress and wide range of reference, but it is also charged with awareness of last things, all the threats to culture and happiness. There have been books, plays and films about Alan Turing before, but in Murmur, Will Eaves ambitiously inhabits the mind of a gay mathematician closely based on him under a different name, giving himself the freedom to explore an explore an obsession (what constitutes a person?) shared by novelists and thinkers about artificial intelligence. A novel is a low-tech device that passes the Turing Test – as long as it moves or excites you. Adam Mars-Jones is the chair of judges for the Goldsmiths prize .

66,"Welcome to this week blog. Here our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Short and sharp to get us going. MsCarey has read William Golding astonishing masterpiece, The Inheritors: Neanderthals meet Homo sapiens. Beautiful. Devastating. Old Filth by Jane Gardam has impressed vermontlogger : A terrific read, and just what a novel ought to be - affecting and fluent and magically full of life and experience. A good friend put it in my hand the other day and said I really should read it. A treat. Rebecca Solnit essay collection A Field Guide to Getting Lost has been a recent highlight for MildGloster : So I’ve read quite a few books since last contributing here, too many to discuss in any depth I suppose — but I will say that a particular highlight was A Field Guide to Getting Lost, which I found not only illuminating and deeply intelligent but brilliantly well-written too, exactly how I like my nonfiction prose: bright, crystalline, articulate and occasionally poetic. Reading Aldous Huxley Brave New World in a book group has worked for RickLondon : Despite being a sucker for vintage science-fiction I’ve somehow never got round to this one, and I’m mightily impressed. The vision is indeed prescient and terrifying, but what is most enjoyable is the clever humour laced throughout. All in all, it offers more satisfying prose than Orwell a novel that is always mentioned in the same breath as Huxley. Controversial! Meanwhile, here Cookyhunter on Agatha Christie: My favourites are her late ones, where she confident and a bit confused by the changing times. This produces some beautifully surreal, spooky fantasies such as Third Girl, The Pale Horse and At Bertram Hotel. Tons of atmosphere, lots of disapproval of young people of the sixties (I find this deeply comfortable) - an apparent disregard for plot, and then suddenly she bamboozles you at the end with this dazzling burst of super logic! It Christie at her most surreal and wonderful. has just finished The Radetzky March by Joseph Roth and says reading it has been “well overdue”: The story covers the plight of a family during the Austro-Hungarian empire climaxing up to the point of the outbreak of the Great War and its inevitable collapse. Atmospheric and vivid prose made it a joy to read with all facets of the human condition expertly portrayed. In particular, the unspoken emotions that all too often exist between father &amp; son and the overwhelming sense of fate that we sometimes feel in our life. Only upon its completion did I appreciate the scope and all-encompassing nature of the story though at no point did it ever feel disjointed. One of those books that leaves a long, pleasant aftertaste ... Just like a good wine. Shirley Jackson We Have Always Lived in the Castle has horrified Oudtshoorn – in a good way : After a few pages I was so frightened that I turned on the TV, simply for the sounds of ordinariness. What an amazing writer she is, or rather, was. Halfway through the story I thought, No - I can’t read books as ridiculously scary as this. By story end, I thought, More, more, more! She has the ability to make one really feel fear, anger, frustration, etc., so that they become actual bodily sensations. I am enchanted by her writing. Have also read as much as I can find about her life, which seems to have been strange and difficult. Finally, a Tips, Links and Suggestions success story courtesy of : A big thank you to Isabelle Leinster, Tom Mooney and others who recommended Don Winslow to me a few weeks ago. I absolutely loved The Power of the Dog. Gripping, brutal, and with such incredible energy. I had a few minor quibbles with some of the characterisation of Art and Nora in particular, who felt a bit out of central casting at times. But it certainly didn’t detract from a fantastic read, and I can’t wait for the next one. Thanks! Lovely. I feel very lucky to have such a positive and useful part of the internet to work on each week. So thanks from me too. Interesting links about books and reading “This great blooming garden-realm ”: it turns out Henry James quite liked California. Christopher Hitchens explains how much to drink while writing . writers who dropped out of school . “When you’re an artist working outside the country, you’re not supposed to criticise Denmark. ‘Don’t foul the nest, don’t piss the nest,’ is what they say”: Dorthe Nors is always fascinating .

67,"Reformation All things polished prismatic creatures caged or free range all things cracked turned dingy history ours made them small. Reformation provides a moment of rest from the array of richly imagined “profiles” and narratives that make up Fred D’Aguiar latest collection of poems, Translations from Memory . The distinctive economy of the writing here may be intended to illustrate the poem ecological and historical concerns. But there is nothing cramped about the vision. While inculpating “history” in general, if not the specific historical reformation of the Christian church in Europe , the poem conducts its survey from the future edge. The minimalist, sometimes one-word construction of the lines suggests a contraction of vastness. It slows the tempo, and heightens the alliterative echoes. The spacing creates an effect of two six-lined sections, with a slightly expanded stanza break between the two. It looks a little like an opened book. Readers of a certain age might pick up an ironic echo of the lingeringly popular Victorian children hymn, All Things Bright and Beautiful . The hymn is notorious for its reference to “the rich man in his castle” and “the poor man at his gate”, implying that all right with the world, because God made everything in it, including injustice and inequality, and is indeed its Lord. In the poem, “polished” and “prismatic” are terms that suggest merchandise. The beautiful objects may have been torn from the earth, from birds and animals, and from people. They may in fact be people. “Prismatic” is emphasised, a tiny, one-word stanza in which the colours seem to have room to coruscate. “Polished” tends more, perhaps, to suggest cultural resonance; ideas and skills as well as skins and minerals have been brought to a perfect shine. These associations connect, of course, to the subsequent reference to “creatures / caged // or free range”. The most fundamental of the broad, inclusive gestures of the poem, it connects with the major theme and continuous sub-theme of the whole collection: slavery. For the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar , the caged bird symbolised the chained slave. (It was a line from one of Dunbar poems, Sympathy, that provided Maya Angelou with the title, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.) The irony of “free range” is that, for the bird reared in such conditions, freedom is fairly illusory. In the poem, the “caged” and “free range” both participate in the list of the depleted. The second half of the poem shows the negative reformation in simple, visual terms: “cracked // turned dingy” – again, suggesting spoiled goods, and, by implication, people traded as goods. The last line of the poem might “reform” that triumphal line of the hymn, which says: “The Lord God made them all.” The “translation” is aphoristically sharp and despairing: “history / ours // made them small.” D’Aguiar is not generally concerned with textual translation in this collection: he applies the word in a broader sense. Poets, philosophers, political radicals and others lend their names to many of the poems. Their ideas and/or their personal stories are variously satirised, domesticated, celebrated. D’Aguiar produces some intriguing translations of lives into metaphor. Socrates, for example, “walked into a mountaintop mine with the disposition / of a canary on the up and up, whistle stop”. Pushkin is offered an additional life, in honour of his African ancestry , Dante circles of hell are redrawn as squares in sand. Among D’Aguiar mentor-poets, Derek Walcott (“DW”) and Kamau Brathwaite (“KB”) are celebrated joyously. The gallery of political and intellectual heroes includes Malcolm, MLK, Mandela, WEB DuBois and “Our King James” (CLR). These abbreviations seem part of the serious trans-cultural game, inviting recognition, but also making the outsider notice the limits and exclusions their own education has entailed. Whether the planet human creatures might coexist without radically mistranslating each other is one of the vigorously posed questions. Reformation is a quick, searing glimpse of a scenario of exploitation and despoliation. But its anger might persuade us that not all the “prismatic” and “polished” have been lost.",674,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/24/poem-of-the-week-reformation-by-fred-daguiar
68,"his autumn rich array of TV drama has pitted original fare against adaptations. On one side, Bodyguard , Black Earth Rising , Press , Strangers ; on the other, Vanity Fair , Trust (derived from Getty dynasty biographies), A Discovery of Witches (from novels by Deborah Harkness), Wanderlust (from its writer Nick Payne stage play). Until last weekend the original team seemed well ahead in acclaim, but then the ecstatic reviews for Killing Eve pulled their opponents level. Given her prominence in advance publicity for the show and critics’ raves, you could be forgiven for assuming that Phoebe Waller-Bridge came up with the serial assassin Villanelle and her titular would-be nemesis in Killing Eve . In fact they originated in ebook singles by Observer dance critic Luke Jennings, who had previously helped former boss Stella Rimington with her spy novels. The idea of a female criminal converted in jail into a chic killer controlled by a tough male mentor presumably stems from Luc Besson film Nikita , but Jennings seems equally influenced by Ian Fleming in a tone that mixes flippant and serious, and in a protagonist with a deluxe lifestyle (centred on fashion and shopping rather than food, drink and sports). In Killing Eve the setup flipped around – his bed-hopping, globetrotting daredevil with a licence to kill is a woman, and is an arch-enemy of British intelligence, not part of it. But Villanelle is a psychopath? Sure, that said of Bond, too. While Waller-Bridge adaptation is strong on useless men, spiky dialogue, and Fleabag -like incidents where the antiheroine behaves like a stroppy or mischievous teenager, her main contribution is refashioning Eve. Jennings’ dogged, drab foil for her protean enemy is brilliantly turned into a kooky, angsty analyst (an Asian-American expat, as played by Sandra Oh, so like Villanelle in Paris an outsider) morphed by fury into an avenger. New too is the series’ title (Jennings’ original ebooks were brought together as Codename Villanelle). A strange feature of the autumn original offerings has been the early exits of female leads. That won’t happen in this case, and not just because its creator is a woman; another factor is that adapted fiction is benignly constrained by its source book. Becky Sharp, we can be pretty confident, will make it to the end of ITV Vanity Fair , but the least likely thing to happen in Killing Eve is someone killing Eve – or Villanelle.",405,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/21/why-killing-eve-is-keeping-our-love-of-adaptations-alive
69,"hat is the point of a literary prize? Is it there to reward good books, or good readers? Does winning the Man Booker prize mean a book is, by default, the best book written in English of the year? And if we’re rewarding “best”, what does that encompass – best prose, best voice, best subject, best author – heck, best cover? Or is it all, as Julian Barnes once said, a big game of “posh bingo”? Whatever the case (and perhaps the answer is: all of the above), the Booker longlist revealed in July seemed – for the first time in many years – to set new parameters for what could be celebrated as Good Literature. Nick Drnaso Sabrina, the first ever graphic novel to be nominated! Belinda Bauer Snap, a rare example of a thriller being held up alongside literary fiction! And that five millennial writers – Sally Rooney, Daisy Johnson, Guy Gunaratne, Sophie Mackintosh and Drnaso – could all be considered for the glitziest symbol of literary establishment, for only their first or second books, was a wonderful endorsement of a fresh generation of fiction writers. But while it would be entirely unfair to damn a six-book shortlist for not having the same scope, this year Booker feels suddenly far more narrowly conceived. Most notably, there is a stark gap between what the judges have chosen to go through to the final stage, and what readers have actually been buying. This year Booker bestsellers have so far been Michael Ondaatje Warlight, Bauer Snap, Rooney Normal People and Drnaso Sabrina. None survived the latest cull. While sales do not factor into the judges’ decision-making, this shortlist is yet another example of the divide between what is celebrated by prizes and what is actually read. That is not to say there can never be a crossover between the two – but this year, we have a noticeable split. In some ways, it is a traditional selection. Johnson aside, four great millennial authors have been omitted, and those that remain all come from either the UK or North America. The shortlist is, regardless, hugely energising. We have the youngest author ever to be shortlisted (Johnson). The thriller and the graphic novel may have gone, but there is a novel in verse (Robin Robertson). We have the novels of four innovative female writers (Anna Burns, Rachel Kushner, Esi Edugyan and Johnson) up for a prize that has been variously (sometimes simultaneously) criticised for being too white, blokey and, more vaguely, a little stuffy. But in the end, perhaps the point of literary prizes is not to celebrate one book, six or even – if they get us talking and reading, it is to celebrate them all.",454,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/20/man-booker-prize-shortlist-narrows-field-and-also-its-sights
70,"he thing that most people know about The Canterbury Tales is that it full of good old-fashioned filth. The storytellers may be on a religious pilgrimage, but they’re just as interested in matters earthy as they are celestial things. For every religious reference, there a bum joke; scatology always follows eschatology. The Knight Tale is a case in point. It is a story full of high-minded sacrifice, courtly love, complex delineations of rank and honour, and examples of chivalry in action. It set in an Athens ruled over by the legendary Theseus, but the account of Palamon and Arcite and their rivalry for the love of the “fair” Emily doesn’t feel particularly classical. If you wanted an archetypal story from the days of olde when knights were bolde, this would be it. There a distinctly Christian edge to the story theology, with the Knight tackling some of the most pressing questions in medieval thinking. At one point, Palamon sits hopeless in jail and riffs on Boethius Consolations of Philosophy. He questions whether divine foresight precludes free will: What governaunce is in this prescience That giltelees tormenteth innocence? What kind of rule is this divine foresight when it torments guiltless innocents? Why would a just God torment the innocent? A weighty question. Even the more ethereal material is worth taking seriously. It is, after all, beautiful. The plot of the Knight Tale may have been an influence on Shakespeare Two Noble Kinsman , but its poetry feels closer to A Midsummer Night Dream. It isn’t only that Theseus and Hippolyta and a wood near Athens feature in both works, but that they both share a joy in the beauty of nature. Just as Shakespeare delights in that bank where the wild thyme grows , so Chaucer treats us to lines such as: And firy Phebus riseth up so brighte, That al the orient laugheth of the lighte, And with his stremes drieth in the greves The silver dropes hanginge on the leves … “Firy Phebus” is the sun, and his streams of light are drying up the silver drops of dew hanging on the leaves in the groves – but you don’t really need to know the meaning to feel that this is a luminous scene. Most of the rest of the story is similarly bright, glowing and hyperreal. The kind of stuff that most high-minded poets have aimed for since the beginning of time. The Canterbury Tales: Chaucer 'plein speke' is a raucous read But thankfully Chaucer is not most poets. Even at his most flowery, he can’t resist getting in the jokes. There a glorious scene when Palamon and Arcite first see Emily in a garden (symbolically enough) , while trapped together in their prison tower. (I’m not ruling out symbolism there , either). To expound at length would probably spoil the joke, but I laughed out loud at the description of the men being pierced by Cupid arrows and immediately arguing over who saw Emily first – gloriously oblivious to their being in prison, and her having no idea who they are. The conclusion of the story feels conventional – Palamon and Emily are left in marital bliss and the Knight piously calls for God blessing on the company – and everyone agrees that it all been very noble. But this elevated atmosphere is soon brought crashing down by the Miller, who drunkenly interrupts the proceedings with a far more sordid story about married life. Palamon and Arcite love for Emily is now thrown into satirical relief by Nicholas and Absolon, two love rivals determined to cuckold a daft old carpenter with his more than willing wife, Alison. This time around, chaste longing is replaced by Alison and Nicholas in bed “in bisnesse of mirthe and of solas” (you can guess the meaning) and a farcical account of bums being kissed, farting and red hot pokers. Just for good measure, Chaucer then drops in the Reeve tale. The Reeve – a carpenter – didn’t like the way his profession was portrayed in the Miller Tale, so he portrays a miller who sleeps in a room with a young man and his wife – as well as a father with his daughter. We’re a long way down from the Knight lofty tale. This heady mix of high and low is often described as uniquely “English” , and Chaucer is credited as being the first to tap into it. That isn’t quite right. Catullus, the very poet Chaucer referenced in the opening of his poem , ran a similarly entertaining line in stately epic , shocking prurience , and a heady mixture of the two . Meanwhile, the original source of the Knight Tale was Boccaccio , an Italian poet who mixed high art and nether regions with the best of them. But the important point is that Chaucer was brilliant at both – a master of the ridiculous and the sublime.",822,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/18/chaucer-poetry-with-low-comedy-canterbury-tales
71,"Welcome to this week blog. Here our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. describes his contribution this week as a “slightly strange rant.” But it well worth reading: Just finished Moby Dick for the second time. Very enjoyable, but could do with some editing. The plot great and the non-fiction whaling parts are fascinating, but there are a few too many chapters where I had only the vaguest idea what the characters or the narrator were talking about. Those bits were easy to skim through though, so not a huge complaint. The action scenes are superb, and left me wishing that someone would have another go at filming it. But alas I doubt it will ever happen, as it would be all too easy to accuse the film of glorifying whaling. It a shame that in films we only get to see depictions of the past in which the protagonists’ viewpoints only echo our modern sensibilities. While we may (rightly) disagree with their views now, it sad and worrying that we’re never exposed to them without a modern critique being overlaid. It leads to an airbrushed version of history, where people of the past are expected to share the same standards as us... Anyway, slightly strange rant over. Moby Dick = Highly recommended. If only Herman Melville were still around to work on a redraft… Meanwhile, here a book where a word isn’t out of place. found a brand new copy of Gobbolino The Witch Cat by Ursula Moray Williams: It was in my local British Heart Foundation store. It was a book I loved as a child. Over the last few days I have been reading it to my nearly six year old and now she like me is enthralled and left in wonder at the adventures of the little cat with three black paws and one pure white one. William Faulkner The Hamlet has impressed paulburns : The first of the Snopes Family trilogy. teeming with Faulkner inventive prose and wild imagination, The Hamlet has characters like the calculating Flem Snopes, the earth-child, Eula; an idiot boy who falls in love with a cow; various ruses and stratagems and cons, and a whole collection of mostly beaten down world weary poor Southerners, victims several generations of of the Civil War and Reconstruction. A stunning inventive read. French Exit by Patrick deWitt has also worked for LLCoolJ : It is fabulous. I’m calling it his best yet. All the adjectives usually applied to deWitt are appropriate here: funny, dark, droll, transgressive, arch, blithe, funny. In a word, deWittian. I just loved it. According to , the “best indication of what happens after Brexit” is Julian Barnes England, England: It sad and melancholic, environmentally promising, a tad sobering, but also hilarious laugh-out-loud. A story for all to read and ponder. Britain never sounded so real in any other novel I’ve read. Talking of rightwing nightmares, Thegreatergood has been reading The Wages Of Destruction by Adam Tooze: It essentially the economic history of the Third Reich and so far the best book I have read on Nazi economics. Its incredible how they moved from one crisis, eg coal, food supply, raw materials to another. The game was up in the autumn of when Barbarossa began to get derailed due to Soviet resistance and appalling logistics at a time Britain and the USA were developing the most awesome military might. One thing that stands out. Speer was a lucky lucky man not to have been hung at Nuremberg. He was as complicit in Nazi war crimes as anyone. But clearly Germany could never win economically and militarily they were simply not strong enough... Thankfully. If you’re into economic history read this. On a happier note, Robert Rudolph has had a special reading experience: I inadvertently got back into Raymond Chandler. I picked up The Big Sleep last night, and the next thing I knew, I was up to page Some books can do that to you. Especially when they contain lines like this one: “Neither of the two people in the room paid any attention to the way I came in, although only one of them was dead.” Raymond Chandler could certainly write them… Interesting links about books and reading BBC Radio In Our Time just did a splendid programme on the Iliad .

72,"The Barber Shop A white rose, the barber towel around your face shining like a beetle clinging to the petals. Clippings scattered on the floor were the days when I loved you so much while the garrulous sculptor of heads cuts away what time had made superfluous. Ah! That unscrupulous hand made you even more beautiful, the curve of your eyebrows more clearly defined and beneath the jade of your eyes, your flowers, your lips half opened. The shop impressed itself on my mind in all its detail and little by little the nothingness which my life would soon become without you came crawling into the scented room. You smiled in the mirror and I crumbled because I had you and would lose you like life classically cut short by a pair of ancient scissors. Translated by the poet and Jackie Willcox Over the summer, reader wrote that this column should look at a contemporary Greek poet. They suggested Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke, whose collection in English, The Scattered Papers of Penelope, “is a team work … a poetry collection filled with Katerina talent and made with a lot of meraki ”. The Scattered Papers of Penelope is a fascinating and well-organised “New and Selected”. As the title suggests, one of its strategies is to imagine the woman poet as a modern Penelope, liberating her from confinement to the original Homeric narrative but retaining some of its symbolic opportunities: “I wasn’t weaving, I wasn’t knitting / I was writing something / erasing and being erased / under the weight of the word.” (Penelope Says, translation by Karen Van Dyck). There are individual poems, prose poems and short sequences, translated by various hands, including the editor and the poet own. The poster didn’t specify a favourite poem so I have chosen one of mine, The Barber Shop, which I think fulfils the first commandment of a poem in translation: to open new horizons in the reader familiar language. The poem begins with a startling image evoking a presumably male muse. The heterosexuality shouldn’t be allowed to disconnect Anghelaki-Rooke from Sappho and her tradition. Technical complexity is less amenable to translation, but the passion and observation of the earlier poet are qualities abundantly present in Anghelaki-Rooke. The Barber Shop exemplifies the immediacy of her love poems and their erotically driven stories. Once we’ve put together the metaphorical pieces of the opening image, we find a startlingly new, masculine flower, almost exotic, but apt and beautiful. (The “white rose” represents the towel, the face of the man being barbered is like the shining beetle, “clinging to the petals” of the surrounding cloth). It will be developed and enriched in later lines, gradually inclining more towards realism. Meanwhile, metaphor-making continues, and the narrative enters time. Past and present tenses mix, perhaps to show how memory blurs perception of the temporal: “Clippings scattered on the floor / were the days when I loved you so much / while the garrulous / sculptor of heads cuts away / what time had made superfluous.” The directness and simplicity of the diction, eg the intensifier in “loved you so much”, allows a “spoken” emotional authority to ground the classical allusions and inventive metaphor-making. The poem is of course retrospective, not a love letter but a voicing of unassuaged regret. The addressee is encountered, tragically, at the beginning of an inevitable loss, the visionary moment after which “nothingness … / came crawling/ into the scented room”. An impassioned personal voice is essential, and the translators capture it. In the future predicted by the speaker, the “garrulous sculptor of heads” (a splendid image of the barber!) becomes a kind of male Atropos , severing the metaphorical thread of the speaker life. As the Wikipedia entry reminds us, in Plato Republic “the three Moirai sing in unison with the music of the Seirenes. Lachesis sings the things that were, Clotho the things that are, and Atropos the things that are to be”. It seems that the song of the Fates has been quietly chanted throughout this poem. Anghelaki-Rooke was born in Athens in and is an internationally acclaimed poet and translator. Introducing her work in the current collection, the editor stresses that many of her more recent poems focus on “gender and language”, and concludes her selection with a poem from Translating Life End Into Love. It featured on this page , in a different English translation, but one that is vivid and compact. Some of the poet own thoughts on her art can be read here .",755,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/17/poem-of-the-week-the-barber-shop-by-katerina-anghelaki-rooke
73,"There was widespread reaction when the Philosopher Stone in the title of the first Harry Potter book became the Sorcerer Stone after its US publisher, Scholastic, decided that children might confuse wizards for Plato. But hordes of books have had their titles changed in America. Disproportionately, they are mysteries. Twenty-five Agatha Christie titles have been “localised” but unfortunately, their new names do not add to their allure. Instead, they merely baffle Brits who, when buying Murder in Three Acts or Poirot Loses a Client on vacation, discover they are Three Act Tragedy or Dumb Witness in disguise. Naturally, book titles change from country to country. Altering the first Potter adventure to Harry Potter a l’Ecole des Sorciers in French is far less baffling than what was done to its American counterpart. Some localisation is to be expected: if you’re translating the text, why not change the title to match? But, with the UK and US sharing a language, why change titles? Sometimes publishers themselves don’t know. For example, Hitler Scapegoat by Stephen Koch will be released by Counterpoint Press in the US next year as Hitler Pawn . I asked their publicity manager why, but she wasn’t sure and said the editor didn’t know either. Ask the Brits, she suggested. Then there The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, a Stuart Turton novel renamed The Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle in the States because, apparently, Americans die more frequently. When asked about the change, US publisher Sourcebooks initially joked : “Our editorial team decided to supersize it.” We’re lucky Christie Three Acts wasn’t upgraded to or – horror of horrors – Tragedy After all, this is the country that slapped the title Little Women II on Louisa May Alcott Good Wives. Sourcebooks senior marketing manager Liz Kelsch said the change was strategic. “There was a title clash in the US and we were worried about confusion,” she said, referring to Taylor Jenkins Reid The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo . “Sometimes,” she said, “a small change can make all the difference.” With more than books published in the US each year, titles have to yell: “Read me!” Take Martha Conway The Floating Theatre, renamed The Underground River in the US. The novel is about two female abolitionists smuggling slaves to freedom. To someone who grew up in the American south like me, The Floating Theatre feels overly Victorian, but The Underground River screams this is about the underground railroad. The Floating Theatre does not interest me, but The Underground River does. Authors don’t necessarily hate the name changes. Diana Gabaldon has said that her novel Cross Stitch benefited from being renamed Outlander for America: “Overall, [Cross Stitch is] not really a good title.” As for PG Wodehouse , they say He Rather Enjoyed It – the title US publishers gave Ukridge. Over the course of literary history, characters such as Romeo, Dracula and Peppa Pig all managed to preserve their titular roles. So why axe poor Ukridge? The world may never know, but fortunately Jeeves was saved: The Inimitable Jeeves became simply Jeeves. Wodehouse was also often localised for US readers: Lord Emsworth and Others became Crime Wave at Blandings. And there have been valid, non-marketing reasons for changing titles: the Christie novel that included the N-word in its title, for example, became And Then There Were None in the US. Ted Hughes The Iron Man would have landed him in the American courts, since Marvel had trademarked the name. There, it The Iron Giant. A work of literature gets its name as a result of a creative collaboration between writer, editor and publicist. And over time, titles are what they are: a book by any other name would read as sweet. But then again, what would Shakespeare know? His titles were never localised.",632,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/13/us-uk-book-titles-changed
74,"Welcome to this week blog. Here our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Let start with a big one. Rex Bowan has been tackling The Making Of Americans by Gertrude Stein: The first stunningly original disaster of modernism, as the New Yorker called it. pages long in an oversized paperback, it contains no dialogue and for one memorable section of pages, includes only one proper noun (a single mention of Herbert Spencer). It is at once dazzling and completely wrong headed in its scaling. I would quote Stein prose, which produces effects that I can’t really recall anyone else doing. But one doesn’t get the impression of the whole from the parts, can’t understand the sheer quantity of repetition. I’ve read most of the usual suspects (Gravity Rainbow, Finnegans Wake, Ulysses, The Unnamable,etc) and it tops Finnegans Wake as the most difficult novel to read by a distance. Any one else read it? How this for a contrast? BMacLean has just finished “another of Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer books,” The Big Kill: The Hammer books are badly written, even by the standards of the genre, but are always entertaining, though not always in the way I imagine Spillane intended Hammer tough-guy posturing, for example, reads like a parody today, but that part of the fun - where else will you find such priceless lines as: “Shut up and answer my questions!” ? recommends The Sad End of Policarpo Quaresma by Lima Barreto: Published in it is a classic in Brazil, apparently. I’d never heard of it, however, before my Brazilian girlfriend thrust it upon me, accompanied by dire threats should I fail to read it. Happily, she was entirely correct; it a wonderful novel. It starts as a well-written, enjoyable, slightly farcical novel about a well-meaning, very patriotic Brazilian civil servant (along the lines of Three Men in a Boat or Don Quixote ). This would be enjoyable in itself, but the darker turn that the novel takes in the second half, leading it to examine questions of loyalty, patriotism and identity is fascinating. Barreto is also a subtle critic of the prevailing societal norms of the time around race and gender (perhaps unsurprisingly for a mixed race author who struggled with discrimination and self-doubt) and writes movingly about the potential for descent into madness, both at the level of the individual and the nation. The Interpretation of Murder by Jed Rubenfeld has fascinated riggbeck : Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung visit New York in to give a series of lectures. The title is presumably a riff on Freud Interpretation of Dreams. During their stay, one young woman is tortured and murdered, while another victim escapes but can’t remember the incident. The victims come from wealthy families and an American disciple of Freud is given the job of recovering the memories through psychoanalysis. Not just a murder mystery but also about secretive, antisemitic forces trying to destroy Freud theories while promoting Jung. And a fascinating description of New York at a time when robber barons ruled. Milkman by Anna Burns has impressed allworthy : Written through Middle Sister eyes, Burns does a great job of creating a vivid Belfast of the full of f memorable characters. It shows how people at ground level are affected. It small town in which people can jump to the wrong conclusions with serious, even tragic, results. People are always being watched and relationships are necessarily complicated. The writing tumbles and spins and there real comic timing in the writing. It very funny at times but some may not like the free flow of ideas. If the book has a fault it that the narrator tells us what we should think as she is learning how to interpret and survive. I didn’t mind that. It felt authentic. We don’t see the real Milkman a great deal which creates a sinister effect. An insightful and creative view of the Troubles. Finally, gardendwarf has received a pleasant reward: The other day, I strolled to my local library, grimly determined to get hold of “something by Truman Capote”. My first choice would have been In Cold Blood, but it was not available then, so I opted for Breakfast at Tiffany instead. And what a wonderful little surprise this was! My expectations had been moulded by what little I had ever seen of the movie adaptation starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard. Holly Golightly is, needless to say, totally different in Capote novella from the movie twin. Basically, a Pippi Longstocking for adults. Isn’t Pippi Longstocking for adults?!

75,"Aristocrats: “I think I am becoming a God” The noble horse with courage in his eye clean in the bone, looks up at a shellburst: away fly the images of the shires but he puts the pipe back in his mouth. Peter was unfortunately killed by an it took his leg away, he died in the ambulance. I saw him crawling on the sand, he said It most unfair, they’ve shot my foot off. How can I live among this gentle obsolescent breed of heroes, and not weep? Unicorns, almost, for they are falling into two legends in which their stupidity and chivalry are celebrated. Each, fool and hero, will be an immortal. The plains were their cricket pitch and in the mountains the tremendous drop fences brought down some of the runners. Here then under the stones and earth they dispose themselves, I think with their famous unconcern. It is not gunfire I hear, but a hunting horn. This week poem provided the title of Owen Sheers recent play about Keith Douglas, Unicorns, Almost . It a remarkable poem in its emotional directness, its historic ranginess and mixture of emblem-making and reportage. There are vivid contrasts of tone as well as image: the ironical eloquence of the dying Emperor Vespasian, source of the epigraph; and the mixture of high, grieving oratory (“How then can I live…”) and scathing vernacular (“stupidity”, “fool”) in the third stanza. Douglasavoids moral judgement, a characteristic of his work noted in this Poetry Foundation essay . Interestingly, Douglas wrote two versions of this poem; the one printed here is the earlier. The later, revised poem is called “Sportsmen” and, as we’ll see, makes some small but significant changes to the last two stanzas. Aristocrats begins with “the noble horse”, standing its ground during the shelling. There seems to be no doubt that Douglas is portraying a real animal. But the third line smuggles in a quick-change of subject, and in the fourth there a sudden, surreal jolt: “but he puts the pipe back in his mouth.” No, the masculine pronoun here obviously can’t refer to the horse. However, the rider is so abruptly introduced, the images remain superimposed. It is half-comical, but hints at the horrible ways organisms are twisted into grotesque coalescence by violent warfare. Did Douglas know of Picasso Guernica? For a moment we might be in that painting, but it a fleeting moment. There a strong suspicion that the man himself is being identified with the horse – “clean” and integrated in response, conditioned to act bravely, but showing some want of intelligence. The next stanza presents a sharp, brilliantly local scene. “Peter”, perhaps a specific individual, is also an everyman in war: an insouciant, selfless – and dying – hero. Understatement predominates as Peter under-estimates the fatal leg-wound delivered by the tank-mounted gun, making light of it as “most unfair”. The reporter has foreshadowed this in his own more formal understatement of regret (“unfortunately”). The tone changes dramatically in the third stanza. In the revised version of the poem, entitled Sportsmen, the lineation changes, so that the last three lines of this stanza read, “Unicorns, almost. For they are fading into two legends/ in which their stupidity and chivalry are celebrated;/ the fool and the hero will be immortals.” The longer third line is less jagged than the truncatedoriginal – but the original remains stronger; it gives those disruptive words greater breathing space and heightens the ironical connection between the two beasts, the war-horse and the once- mythological unicorn. That the contemporary, human “unicorns” are “falling into two legends” recalls military terminology (“falling into line”) and the state of being “fallen”. By comparison, “fading into” has a more predictable, elegiac focus. In Sportsmen, the last stanza is as follows: “These plains were a cricket pitch And in the hills the tremendous drop fences Brought down some of the runners who Under these stones and earth lounge still In famous attitudes of unconcern. Listen Against the bullet cries the simple horn.” The transposition of sporting images to the battlefields is common to both versions – and both have the stomach-lurching image of the “tremendous drop fences”, originating in steeple-chasing. I prefer, in the earlier version, “mountains” over “hills” and the specific “hunting horn” over “simple horn,” since both emphasise the reference to The Song of Roland and such tales of ill-fated knightly chivalry. The additional detail about the runners who “lounge still/ in famous attitudes of unconcern” is effective, though, depicting the dead bodies with a trace of the visual shock found in the opening stanza. Rowland Smith in The Dalhousie Review makes a good case for preferring the final stanza of Aristocrats . Douglas might have revised the poem further, or reverted to his earlier version, had he survived to see his collection through the press (he died in Normandy in It seems reasonable to make room for both versions – all the better to let the poet questions about chivalry persist and worry in an age of drones and air-strikes.",840,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/10/poem-of-the-week-aristocrats-by-keith-douglas
76,"In contrast to the slew of movies devoted to art thieves (Entrapment, Ocean Twelve, The Thomas Crown Affair, etc), purloining books has had a poor showing on screen – just the obscure Canadian film The Art of the Steal, and a Mr Bean sketch in which the klutz cuts up a codex, if you leave out the The Book Thief benign “borrowings”. Is this because most textual treasures are not beautiful objects – just print behind covers - or because Hollywood is in denial about its dependency on books and so undervalues them? American Animals review – audacious stupidity and teeth-clenching thrills Whatever the cause, literary robbery at last gets its due in American Animals, a new film re-enacting a botched burglary in Planning to steal super-rare plates from John Audubon Birds of America , a gang of Kentucky students raided Transylvania University library preposterously disguised as elderly scholarly types. Although their haul (including a Darwin first edition) was worth they had to leave behind the heavy Audubon volumes.

77,"Welcome to this week blog. Here our roundup of your comments and photos from last week - and the week before. Here a big claim to get us going: according to originalabsence , The Mars Room shows that Rachel Kushner is the best writer in America: In this new book she enters the world of female correctional facilities and the tough and gritty backgrounds that led there. The nuance, subtly and shocking visceral personas characterised explodes all the stereotypes and tropes of countless movies and TV shows with lived realities the surround your mind as you read, every moment, every gesture, word, thought, is unique and believable happenstance. For me there isn’t a living writer who comes close to this scale of detailed authenticity and grandeur. Think of all that tough punk-muscular prose from the big C male beasts of fiction? Rachel Kushner not only lives with them, at times verbally she out-punches them, overall she completely eclipses them. For my money there isn’t a better living writer in America just now. Several of the big Russians have made an appearance over the past fortnight. has been tackling Tolstoy: A couple of weeks ago I finished Tolstoy Selected Short Stories, from the cheapo Dover edition which included pieces spanning a period of nearly sixty years, as well as ‘The Forged Coupon’ which has been published separately. I love, sort of crave , actually, his smoothly, soothly, beautiful style of writing, sharp characterisations, and profound, all-seeing compassion. Reading him gave me a completely unexpected sense of peace in spite of all the battles and betrayals. And that is also a tribute to the perfectly seamless translation. And vermontlogger has enjoyed Turgenev On The Eve: A fine tale, told with the usual marvellous urbanity. There the worthless father off with his mistress in Moscow, the dejected mother left on the country estate with her undemanding young companion, all dimples, the layabout uncle, and then the rather tense daughter, who is passionate for life and has a circle of interested men – the talkative aspiring sculptor, the professorial student of philosophy, the steely-minded Bulgarian nationalist, and the careful bureaucrat on the make. The characters leap off the page. Who, if any of them, will find fulfilment? I so wanted to know I tore through it. The Fountain Overflows (by Reading Group favourite Rebecca West ) has impressed HousmansEngland : An autobiographical novel set during the first decade of the century. The narrator is Rose, one of a pair of twins who are very talented pianists. Their mother was a successful concert pianist before she gave it up to marry the wastrel Piers and raise a family. There is an older sister, Cordelia who believes herself to be a talented violinist. A cruel awakening awaits her. The family live in poverty, exacerbated by the father habit of unwise investments. They keep their spirits up, and never neglect their musical studies. There are some trenchant remarks on art and politics, but this is a very witty and amusing novel. Women In Love, by West contemporary DH Lawrence, has left interwar all aswirl: Finishing this, I feel as though I’ve emerged from a sauna of swirling, steamy emotions and philosophical musing; my head is still not quite clear. Sisters Gudrun and Ursula Brangwen open the novel with a discussion of why they might or might not want ever to marry. ‘I don’t know,’ says one. ‘It depends how you mean.’ But ‘how one means’ is rarely ever very clear in the curious conversations that people, even sisters, hold with each other or in their private thoughts. It all very intense, and dense, and yet somehow detached. Alan Bennett Diaries might be easier going - as explains: Sometimes funny, often moaning, occasionally poignant. He describes a couple of encounters when people mistake him for David Hockney. One hilariously bizarre conversation with a rather confused woman, who says she both a huge fan of his plays, and that she loves his paintings of trees too. Finally, interwar has been working through back issues of Tit-Bits , “a popular magazine of the time (PG Wodehouse contributed jokes to it early in his career)”: Of great interest are the adverts, most of which seem to be pushing quack remedies. Dr Cassell Tablets, for example, will cure you of a range of afflictions, from indigestion to ‘nervous breakdown’. There is a sleep cure for stammerers, trousers cut to hide bow legs, remedies for baldness, ‘fits’, alcoholism, tobacco addiction. One ad cries out in oversized letters: ‘Ruptured? Throw Away Your Truss!’ But I’m really wondering whatever happened to La-Mar Reducing Soap: ‘Reduce any part of the body without affecting other parts. No diet or exercise’.

Produced by the makers of Poldark, ITV new version of Vanity Fair (starting on Sunday) similarly shows a likable low-born woman winning the heart of a toff – several toffs, in her case – in the Napoleonic era. Gwyneth Hughes adapted the novel and has talked of a tradition of viewing Thackeray novel as “a harsh story ... about a naughty social climber”, whereas her Becky is “a poor orphan who needs to get on – if she doesn’t, she’ll starve”. Played by Olivia Cooke, the artist daughter may become more bitter and ruthless in later instalments, but in part one she sweet and vulnerable with no flaws on show: no ulterior motives in her friendship with Amelia, and nothing blameworthy in her wooing of a rich dunce. Hughes presents her as a bilingual modern European woman, belonging to the new era – symbolically dumping England by throwing away Johnson Dictionary and crying “Vive Bonaparte!” – when those around her are stuck in the old, insular one. Appearing at intervals, TV adaptations of Vanity Fair tend to come towards the ends of decades and inevitably find parallels with their own times. In a BBC production, Susan Hampshire Becky was a chick, resembling the liberated protagonists of contemporary films. Twenty years on, at the height of the Thatcher era, Eve Matheson spunky redhead “who will stop at nothing” (as the publicity proclaimed) could hardly fail to embody the spirit of the age. In Natasha Little was the anti-heroine in an Andrew Davies-scripted serial that epitomised the “harsh” approach. Her Becky too (as a complementary BBC documentary invoking celebrities like Madonna underlined) reflected her decade, but could also be seen as encapsulating the ethos of the Tory reign that had just ended. Cheering on Becky, rather than tut-tutting, starts on the big screen with the Reese Witherspoon movie: with a star committed to empowering women, a feminist Indian director (Mira Nair) drawn to social outsiders, and a script by a future Tory peer (Julian Fellowes) predisposed to applaud the Thatcherite ambition other adapters despised, she was always bound to rebound. As well as endorsing this pro-Becky perspective, the ITV/Amazon Vanity Fair performs the customary function of depicting its own decade in historical guise: the Cameron years, when a resurgent feminism collided with a snobbish, sexist elite that closed ranks instead of opening itself up – and, fortuitously, the snooty figure who blocks Becky entry to it in the opener (by nixing her chances of marrying Jos Sedley) is George Osborne. Among its innovations is the deployment of Michael Palin as Thackeray, genially introducing episodes with a merry-go-round as backdrop (a reworking of the novel image of its world as a puppet theatre). This is not quite the first appearance of the novelist on screen, since Palin has a distinguished predecessor; in the French film Les soeurs Bronte , the Thackeray who meets the sisters in London is played by ... Roland Barthes. Part one of Vanity Fair is on ITV on Sunday.",521,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/01/vanity-fair-becky-sharp
79,"his month, the Reading group is asking for recommendations about vacations. Summer on the wane in the UK, but that simply makes me want to cling to the last vestiges of sunshine, take one more dip in the sea and feel the warm glow on my skin before the cold sets in. And read or reread summer classics. Choosing reading material so late in the season works for me because so many of my favourite books about holidays are infused with the melancholy of passing time and deal with pleasures that feel all the brighter because they are brief. In fact, it is often better to read these books at home rather than on the beach, in case they leave you feeling painfully mortal (Thomas Mann Death in Venice is an astonishing book – but might also result in you considering walking into the sea and not coming back). Plenty of other summer classics are also brimming with tragedy. The end of summer in F Scott Fitzgerald Tender Is the Night feels like the end of everything. Ernest Hemingway The Sun Also Rises is no party, either. And Paul Bowles The Sheltering Sky is possibly the ultimate going-on-holiday-by-mistake novel.

80,"As we come to the end of The Moonstone , we must ask a very important question: what the hell? Here – and this is spoiler territory, so please go and enjoy the end of the novel for yourself before reading the following paragraphs – is how things conclude. The mysterious disappearance of the Moonstone diamond was just an unfortunate accident. The whole novel is something of a shaggy dog story – and the Moonstone the MacGuffinest MacGuffin of them all. We learn that Franklin Blake, the ardent young man most eager to solve the puzzle, was actually the person who took the gemstone. As a kind of practical joke, he was spiked with laudanum after the dinner party at which Rachel Verinder first wore the precious stone. In the middle of the night, in a poppy-induced stupor, he went into Rachel bedroom and took the stone, intending to hide it so it couldn’t be stolen by anyone else. As he hunted for the stone, Rachel, still awake, sat and watched him in amazement. Later, she refused to blab on a man she loved and said nothing about his guilt. Meanwhile, the immoral (and indebted) Godfrey Ablewhite found the Moonstone after Franklin, in his night-time confusion, failed to hide it properly – and so the long chain of circumstances that made up the rest of the novel was set in motion. After about pages, outsider Ezra Jennings begins to understand what happened and conducts an “experiment” by putting Franklin back on laudanum, to recreate the night the Moonstone disappeared. Franklin duly went on another midnight ramble – and everyone took that as the proof they needed about the “theft” of the stone. So the innocent lived happily ever after and the unjust got their desserts. As I describe it here, this conclusion sounds absurd. It seemed pretty silly to me as I read it too, even if Wilkie Collins tried to provide a wealth of scientific detail and learned-sounding references to bolster his ideas about laudanum and memory. But this bizarre grand finale has inspired plenty of other authors, including Philip Pullman, who used a similar opium-induced memory to end his first Sally Lockhart mystery, The Ruby In The Smoke . And if you’re having doubts about opium effect on memory, meanwhile, we can turn to no other than Collins himself for insight. According to Peter Ackroyd biography , the author took so much laudanum while writing The Moonstone that he once said: “I was not only pleased and astonished at the finale, but did not recognise it as my own.” How very neat to be unable to remember writing about memory loss. While I did not buy into the scientific pretence of Ezra experiment, I did enjoy reading about it. Collins had done such a good job of gripping me in his narrative that I wasn’t going to be tripped by the final hurdle. Even if the mechanics of the conclusion are ludicrous, there is plenty that remains ingenious and intriguing. It was Franklin who took the stone; who, after spending so much time and energy looking for answers in obscure places, found them within himself. The Moonstone was written almost years before Sigmund Freud published The Interpretation of Dreams , when you can see the germ of psychotherapy in Franklin delusions and eventual insights. Not least because his actions are so sexually fraught. What was he doing breaking into the virginal Rachel bedchamber? What was she thinking as she sat there, wide awake, watching him in silence? If you’re thinking that my reaction is too prurient for a Victorian readership, we can again turn to the authority of Collins. It is not just that he had a complicated love life – involving relationships and families outside wedlock – and views that hardly fitted our general stereotype of the century. It that hehad written about such issues – and sharply. Here a telling snatch of dialogue from The Woman In White : “There is another misfortune,” I said, “to which a woman may be liable, and by which she may suffer lifelong sorrow and shame.” “What is it?” she asked eagerly. “The misfortune of believing too innocently in her own virtue, and in the faith and honour of the man she loves,” I answered. There a troubling darkness at the centre of The Moonstone, a shadow that lingers after its bright and happy ending. Even at its most preposterous, this is a fascinating, compelling novel. Collins is wonderful.",749,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/21/what-do-you-think-of-the-moonstones-ending#comment-119664155
81,"Where would summer be without a series of reading blogs? This year subject, ""a book for the beach"", might seem limiting, but there are as many sorts of beach holiday as there are books to enjoy on them. For someone who, like me, spends their working life reading in straight lines – what new, is it any good? – holidays offer the luxury of reading in circles. It was just such a loop that brought me back to Wide Sargasso Sea, one of the great prequels of world literature. It began a couple of years ago with Jenny Uglow wonderful biography of the engraver Thomas Bewick , whose History of British Birds is the book with which the Jane Eyre diverts herself behind the curtains at Gateshead Hall, until it is hurled at her head by her odious cousin. I'd always assumed that Jane was escaping into beautiful avian images, but it turns out that a far more gothic imagination is hidden between the chapters, in a series of sinister miniature engravings. I got out my old copy of Jane Eyre, and there was the evidence: ""The fiend pinning down the thief pack behind him""; ""the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows."" How had I never noticed this before? Could it be that the poor little orphan of my memory was harbouring vengeful fantasies? Had I all along been mistaking a gothic character for a Dickensian one? It with assumptions such as this that Jean Rhys plays in her fabulously atmospheric exploration of the life of the first Mrs Rochester. Antoinette Conway is an orphan, too, as a Creole heiress marooned in Jamaica, in the ruins of a slaving culture that has made her a pariah to her black neighbours. When she is a child, the family mansion is torched and a girl whom she wants to be her friend throws a rock at her head – incidents that resound with distorted echoes of Jane Eyre. There is nothing idyllic about life on this island, and Dominican-born Rhys is brilliant at evoking the swarming oppressiveness of relentless sunshine. Where Brontë gothic is cold and dark, Rhys sweats and swelters. ""I knew the time of day when though it is hot and blue and there are no clouds, the sky can have a very black look,"" says Antoinette, who nevertheless finds razor grass, red ants and snakes ""better, better than people"". Into this hallucinatory inversion of an island paradise blunders Edward Rochester, a malarial younger son in search of a fortune, who picks up the narrative in the second section with his own sense of alienation: ""Too much blue, too much purple, too much green. The flowers too red, the mountains too high, the hills too near."" Rhys triumph is to put a modernist palette to the service of the imagination: she lets us see the colours while also demonstrating to us how they appear to Rochester. Published in this isn't simply a prequel but a deeply political novel in its own right, in which names echo with a traumatic history that can barely be remembered, let alone mentioned: a town called Massacre, a boy called Disastrous, and Antoinette herself, who is cruelly stripped of her illusions by a husband who insists on calling her Bertha. ""Him not a bad man, even if he love money, but he hear so many stories he don't know what to believe,"" says Antoinette witchy old nanny, Christophine, who dispenses country wisdom along with the rum she uses to sedate her ""doudou"". Christophine is the nearest the novel gets to a presiding spirit: she too is an outsider, who was brought to Jamaica as a wedding present for Antoinette mother in the years before emancipation. She practises ""obeah"" (voodoo) and her motives and loyalties are always mysterious. By concocting a ""love potion"" to be administered to Edward, she effectively sets up one of the novel most devastating scenes, in which he reprises the atrocities of colonialism by casually seducing the servant girl who nurses him back to health, as his drugged wife sleeps in the next room. ""I looked into her lovely meaningless face,"" he says. "" … In the morning I felt differently. Another complication. Impossible. And her skin was darker, her lips thicker than I had thought."" Has a single word ever been more powerfully deployed than that adjective ""meaningless""? In prose becoming steadily more queasy and disorientating, we witness a disintegration that is also a disinheritance. The final section is narrated by Bertha from her attic in Thornfield Hall, where she is brutally constrained by Charlotte Brontë character Grace Poole. In the flicker of a candle on a draughty stairwell, the two novels come together, and two very different sorts of gothic merge into one. Concise, chilling and richly evocative, this is a beach read for people who think of holidays as a time to make connections.

82,"The secret of a successful book, it has often been said, is a beautiful girl and a happy ending. Well, there aren't many beautiful girls in Samuel Selvon The Lonely Londoners, which I first read at university in the as a recommended text in my Caribbean fiction class. Tanty, the most prominent female character in the book, is a nosy old matron whose favourite pastime is discussing other people business at the top of her voice in shops, as if she is ""in the market-place back home"". And the ending - well, there isn't really an ending; instead of a definite closure, the reader is left with a sense of a vague and gloomy continuum, as the protagonist Moses Aloetta stands before the Thames contemplating his future, staring into the signature London fog that is the novel dominant motif. The novel, published in is set in London and concerns the group of Caribbean immigrants known as the ""Windrush"" generation, who arrived on the SS Windrush in A lot of them had fought for Britain in the second world war and, having found that they couldn't settle back into their small island communities, decided to seek better opportunities in the ""mother country"". Welcomed at first by the British as a source of cheap labour, by the late as their numbers grew, they became a target of racial hatred and xenophobia, and even hasty anti-immigration legislation in parliament. The gloom hits you from the very first sentence: ""One grim winter evening, when it had a kind of un-realness about London, with a fog sleeping restlessly over the city and the lights showing in the blur as if not London at all but some strange place on another planet ..."" For the Caribbean immigrants whom Moses goes to Waterloo station to meet, London may well be another planet. They are welcomed by the cold weather, and a reporter asking them why they can't stay in their home country. Their disorientation is best represented by Henry Oliver, aka Sir Galahad, who, in this harsh winter, descends from the train in a light summer suit and appears surprised when asked if he isn't cold. As it turns out, he only feels cold in summer, and hot in winter. With this deft move, the author immediately establishes the ""otherness"" of these immigrants, showing you how unprepared they are for the chilly English welcome. The reader knows that sooner or later a character like Sir Galahad is going to have his illusions shattered. The Lonely Londoners was the first novel to take on the task of representing this unrepresented group. Because the immigrants lived on society fringes, not many people knew of their existence, and those who did, such as workplace foremen or employment office clerks, pretended they did not exist. At the employment office, the veteran Moses explains the ways of this new society to Galahad: ""Suppose a vacancy come and they want to send a fellar, first they find out if they want coloured fellars before they send you. That save a lot of time and bother, you see. In the beginning it cause a lot of trouble when fellars went and said they came from the labour office and the people send them away saying it ain't have no vacancy. They don't tell you outright that they don't want coloured fellars, they just say sorry the vacancy get filled."" It is this shadow group of people that Selvon novel forcefully thrusts into the daylight. Other writers soon followed in his footsteps, most notably Colin MacInnes, with City of Spades and Absolute Beginners. MacInnes showed how under- represented this class of people was, especially in the media: ""As one skips through contemporary novels or scans over acreage of fish-and-chips dailies and the very square footage of the very predictable weeklies ... it is amazing - it really is - how very little one can learn about life in England here and now."" One of the ways in which The Lonely Londoners brought the fringe into the centre was through the conscious use of an episodic plot structure that has been described as ""calypsonian"" and ""balladic"". Such oral narrative devices go hand in hand with the book use of non-standard English, the island dialect used in both dialogue and narrative passages. Once in a while, the reader is taken unawares by the author reverting to standard English, especially in the lyrical ""stream of consciousness"" passages that describe the coming of summer and its sensual and sensory beauties. Selvon in fact began writing the book in conventional English. How fortunate that he changed his mind, for no standard English can capture the characters' earthiness, folksiness or conviction. Indeed, the book major strength is its depiction of character. Selvon knew these immigrants intimately: he was one of them as a member of a group of Caribbean writers - including VS Naipaul, George Lamming, Andrew Salkey, Derek Walcott - who came to London in the But Selvon, more than the others, specialised in telling the stories of working-class black characters and their experience of discrimination in the big city. Some critics have described The Lonely Londoners as really nothing more than a collection of mini biographies, a group of lives interacting with each other. But what makes this collection stand out is how painstakingly the author has drawn them; Selvon has a way of investing the most tiny, insignificant detail with a universe of meaning. His characters are not saints; they are wife-beaters, cheats, weed-smokers, skirt-chasers. But by boldly using the stereotypes that white society creates around black society, he transcends them to create real, multi-dimensional characters. We soon forget their vices because essentially they are ordinary folks trying to survive in a harsh, foreign society that is intent on suppressing them. We share their anguish, their anxieties, their frustrations and their joys. Above all, we admire their courage as they negotiate streets whose windows carry signs that say ""Keep the Water White"". Each character adds to the communal portrait: there is the irrepressible, voluble Tanty, who finally forces the neighbourhood grocers to start extending credit to their Caribbean customers; there is the parsimonious Bart who, if ""he see a friend who broken, and the friend beg him for a meal, and Bart do without eating himself so he wouldn't have to change the pound and ease up the friend""; and there the uneducable Big City, whose life is ruled by two dreams - to win big on the Pools and to visit all the big cities of the world. If he wins big, his ambition is to ""buy out a whole street and give it to the boys and ... I would put a notice on all the boards: 'Keep the Water Coloured, No Room for Whites'."" Then there the shiftless, elusive Cap, whose aversion to working is matched only by his strange attractiveness to women. But this is not only a novel about race and survival; it is also a novel about the city. Selvon descriptions of post-war London are so powerful and evocative that one fancies oneself alive and present on these same streets. He brings to life the grubby, working-class backstreets of the Harrow Road and Notting Hill, and the seemingly unbreachable divide between them and the rich neighbourhoods of Belgravia, Knightsbridge and Hampstead. He shows how London is not one city, but a compendium of many little cities: ""It have people living in London who don't know what happening in the room next to them, far more the street, or how other people living. London is a place like that. It divide up in little worlds, and you stay in the world you belong to and you don't know anything about what happening to the other ones except what you read in the papers."" One imagines immediately the loneliness that must have gnawed at these immigrants whose memory of their sunny, convivial island communities was their only refuge at such moments. But although this is a book about exile and alienation, it is not a sad book. Even when his characters are under-going the direst of tribulations, Selvon has a way of capturing the humour in the situation. When Galahad, out of a job, racked by hunger and winter cold, decides to catch a pigeon from Kensington Gardens and eat it, he is chased away by an old woman who threatens to get the police. But like all good humorists, Selvon employs comedy to make serious statements. With the pigeon incident we are shown two opposed world-views: one that sees pigeons as food, and another that would rather see a man starve than let him use pigeons as food. This difference is underlined by Moses remonstrance to Galahad: ""Boy, you take a big chance ... You think this is Trinidad? Them pigeons there to beautify the park, not to eat. The people over here will kill you if you touch a fly."" The message of The Lonely Londoners is even more vital today than in Britain: that, although we live in societies increasingly divided along racial, ideological and religious lines, we must remember what we still have in common - our humanity. As the novel says: ""Everybody living to dead, no matter what they doing while they living, in the end everybody dead."" · Measuring Time by Helon Habila is published by WW Norton this month",1562,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/17/society1
83,"Translated literary fiction is selling better on average in the UK than literary fiction originally written in English, according to new research, with authors including Elena Ferrante, Haruki Murakami and Karl Ove Knausgaard driving a boom in sales. Though fiction in translation accounts for just of literary fiction titles published, it accounted for of sales in according to a survey commissioned by the Man Booker International prize. The research, conducted by Nielsen Book, looked at physical book sales in the UK between January and April It found that translated fiction sales almost doubled over the last years, from to copies, while the market for fiction as a whole fell from in to in Although the proportion of translated fiction is still “extremely low”, at overall, the sector still “punches well above its weight”, said the book sales monitor, with that accounting for of total fiction sales in “On average, translated fiction books sell better than books originally written in English, particularly in literary fiction,” said Nielsen. Looking specifically at translated literary fiction, sales rose from copies in to in with translated literary fiction accounting for just of literary fiction titles published, but of the volume of sales in of our top fiction titles are translated - if more were published I’m sure that percentage would be even higher Chris White, fiction buyer for Waterstones “In every literary fiction title written in English sold an average copies, while every translated literary fiction title sold only copies. By this had completely changed – every literary fiction title written in English sold an average of only copies, while every translated literary fiction title sold an average of copies,” said Fiammetta Rocco, administrator of the Man Booker International prize. “Not only are the numbers of translated books sold going up, but there is an incredibly devoted readership in Britain of translated fiction. We were amazed to discover this – the only thing we’ve known is the figure and we didn’t know if that related to the number of titles published, or to sales. For translated literary fiction, it turns out the proportion published is about the same, at but that sales are much higher, at Rocco said the research was “confirmation of the health and growth potential of international fiction in the UK”, and expressed the hope that it would “encourage publishers and agents to take more risks and invest in translation”. This year Man Booker International prize will be awarded for the first time to a single book translated into English, rather than an author body of work. Deborah Smith, publisher at Tilted Axis Press and translator of Han Kang The Vegetarian , which is shortlisted for this year prize, said she was “not surprised” by Nielsen Book “encouraging” research. “Part of the reason I became a translator in the first place was because Anglophone or Eurocentric writing often felt quite parochial. Setting up Tilted Axis Press came from a similar impulse; our focus on Asian literatures – where linguistic experimentation is informed by daily lives shifting between languages – is a brilliant way of discovering the stylistic innovation and non-conforming narratives that most excite us,” said Smith. “Judging by this year Man Booker International long- and shortlists, which included titles from South Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, the Congo, the industry as a whole is definitely waking up to the fact that a lot of the most original and distinctive writing is happening in these areas. Exploring the underrepresented is also a great way to stand out in a crowded market as a publisher – when people hear we’re doing the UK first ever translation of contemporary Thai fiction, they sit up and take notice.” The 'Ferrante phenomenon' has helped drive sales of Italian fiction from in to in “We’ve now reached a stage where not only are people happy to read fiction in translation, they are positively seeking it out,” agreed Waterstones fiction buyer Chris White. “Currently of our top fiction titles are translated and if more were published I’m sure that percentage would be higher still.” White said that the growth of Scandinavian crime had “certainly helped to break down any psychological barriers or pre-conceptions which readers may have had about translated fiction”. “The popularity of the likes of Stieg Larsson and Jo Nesbo has made people realise that ‘translated’ doesn’t automatically equal ‘difficult’ or ‘worthy’,” he said. “As a result, readers are now reading translated fiction of every description and you’re as likely to find My Brilliant Friend, The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared or Look Who Back on the bestseller tables as you are The Girl in the Spider Web.” Rocco believes there are three reasons for the increase: “People travel more and more people travel, there is highbrow foreign television coming here, so the whole landscape of foreignness is much more even – people cross boundaries much more easily. There are some stand-out authors like Knausgaard, Murakami and Ferrante. And there are also small publishers today, who were set up to deal almost entirely with translated fiction, which wasn’t the case years ago.” Elena Ferrante: the global literary sensation nobody knows French remains the most popular language for translation, with books sold in and more than in found Nielsen. But books were translated from languages over the period studied, from Afrikaans to Yiddish. The “ Ferrante phenomenon ” helped drive sales of Italian literary fiction, up from in to in while Korean books also boomed, up from copies in to in according to the research. By the most popular languages for translation were French, Italian, Japanese, Swedish and German, while in they were French, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Mandarin. Nielsen noted that “the languages of the Indian sub-continent are extremely under-represented with just a handful of titles published from Kannada and a fall in the number of literary fiction from Hindi available in the period from to titles”.

84,"arly in Elizabeth Strout new novel, My Name Is Lucy Barton, the narrator, a doctor, after wishing his patient good night and leaving her hospital bedside, “made a fist and kissed it, then held it in the air as he unswished the curtain and left the room”. In both its deficiency (an expression of tenderness curbed by protocols both professional and personal) and its sincerity (the militant earnestness of the salute), the gesture seems to contain everything Strout is saying about love: that it hard and awkward and will always be inadequately expressed, but that it also something we need to grab and hold in our fists. Lucy is recovering in hospital after a mysterious infection following the removal of her appendix. These nine weeks of her recovery become a lifetime – figuratively in terms of her boredom and loneliness, and structurally, as Lucy tells the story of her childhood, marriage and, most important of all, how she became a writer. They’re all meditations prompted by the arrival of her estranged mother, whose expressions of love are even more compromised than the doctor raised fist. There are pieces of me in every character, because that my starting point, I’m the only person I know Writing in the New York Times, the novelist Claire Messud proclaimed Lucy Barton an “exquisite novel”, praising its “careful words and vibrating silences”. Hilary Mantel marvelled at “an attention to reality so exact that it goes beyond a skill and becomes a virtue”. Since its publication in the US last month the book has been riding at the top of the New York Times bestseller list. Strout, who turned last month, lives in a homely and book strewn apartment in a grand building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She is seated at a pine dining table so crowded with flowers that I worry someone has died. But no. “These are from my English publisher,” she says, “and these are from a dinner last night!” And she laughs, embarrassed at this minor theft. That kissed fist gesture the doctor makes was, she says, stolen, too: “I don’t know where I saw that, but I do think I saw it.” Her five novels have begun “always, always” with a person, and her eyes and ears are forever open to these small but striking human moments, squirrelling them away for future use. “Character, I’m just interested in character,” she says. But readers, more than ever, are also interested in the author. In Strout published Olive Kitteridge , a collection of short stories set in the small fictional town of Crosby, Maine, in which the lives of its residents, in all their public disappointments and private desires, thread through the life of Olive, a retired schoolteacher who as unwitting in her tyranny as she is in her kindness. When US radio host Terry Gross recently mentioned the suicides that run through the Pulitzer prize-winning novel, Strout conceded: “There is a history of suicide in my family, and I think that it always been very compelling to me as a result,” but declined to elaborate. Strout has made herself vulnerable to further autobiographical readings with the character of Lucy Barton, a writer who grew up in an isolated and strict family in a small rural town in Illinois (Strout grew up in small towns in Maine and New Hampshire), and now lives in New York, having found writing success later in her life. Yet Lucy mentor, an older writer named Sarah Payne, at one point tells an audience sharply that it is not her job “to make readers know what a narrative voice and not the private view of the author”. The rebuke seems to blast out directly through the book fourth wall. “You know, there always autobiography in all fiction,” Strout says. “There are pieces of me in every single character, whether it a man or a woman, because that my starting point, I’m the only person I know. But yes, Sarah Payne ... I realised in that scene, ‘OK, here a chance to let people know.’” She goes on to explain: “You can’t write fiction and be careful. You just can’t. I’ve seen it with my students over the years, and I think actually the biggest challenge a writer has is to not be careful. So many times students would say, ‘Well, I can’t write that, my boyfriend would break up with me.’ And I’d think ...” she sucks her teeth, “‘Well, OK, I’m sorry, I don’t really have much more to tell you.’ You have to do something that going to say something, and if you’re careful it just not going to work.” Or, as Sarah Payne tells Lucy, “We all love imperfectly. But if you find yourself protecting anyone as you write this piece, remember this: You’re not doing it right.” Strout spent years toiling as a writer without getting anything published. “I sent out stories and I didn’t even get, ‘Try us again,’ I just got,” she makes a shooing away gesture, “the basic ‘No.’” She remembers hearing the writer and critic Francine du Plessix Gray say it takes years of solid writing to get good at a time when Strout had already put in a good “I was very slow at getting up to that ability to have the sentences do what I needed them to do. I probably was too careful for a long time.” My Name Is Lucy Barton by Elizabeth Strout review – beautifully compelling By the time she wrote her first novel, Amy and Isabelle , “I could just handle a sentence better because I’d been writing for so long, I could get the sentence to go into that crevice.” More importantly, she was riding on a liberating, nothing-to-lose bravado: “I thought, ‘Probably no one will ever read this – oh well, just write it.’” The novel, which details the fraught relationship between an isolated mother and daughter, was nominated for several awards and made into a TV movie in Four more books have followed and that “Oh well, just write it” sentiment has remained. “With Lucy the first huge surprise was that I made her a writer. I just couldn’t believe it – I thought, ‘You’re doing first person, and then you’re going to make her a writer?’ That felt almost boring because who wants to read about a writer? But it was that little scrap where she in the schoolroom and she reading and she realises books are broader things and made her feel less alone. And then I realised, ‘Lucy, you’re going to have to be a writer.’” Like Lucy, Strout read a book when she was very young about a girl “who was strange and unattractive because she was dirty and poor”, and Strout felt less alone. Like Lucy, it made her want to be a writer. “I realised,” Strout says, “I will never see the world except through my own eyes, and that was a remarkable thing to realise. I think many people live their whole lives and don’t realise that.” Books were about the only miracles Strout had growing up. At one stage, her family lived on a dirt road, and such was her parents’ strictness that there was no TV or newspapers, just the New Yorker. Her father was a professor and her mother a teacher; they believed in education, but not in the outside world. As she once put it, they had, “a skeptical view of pleasure”. When she went to college she had only seen two films: Dalmatians and The Miracle Worker . Her mother did, however, give her notebooks and encouraged her to write; to this day her mother reads every new book within a few hours of receiving it and then calls her daughter to tell her it her best yet. After graduating from Bates, a liberal arts college in Maine, Strout dragged herself off to law school in because she had a “social conscience and I wanted to do good things, and I thought, ‘Law is language ...” she makes a face. “I was just so misinformed. I came out and I was just an awful, awful lawyer for six months, and that when I had the realisation, ‘If I’m which seemed ancient, ‘and I’m a cocktail waitress, and I haven’t published anything, that will be pathetic.’ I remember thinking, ‘If I’m dying, at least I can say to myself I tried, I really tried for it.’ I thought, ‘Let just go for it.’” And five years before she turned she won the Pulitzer prize. “I’m glad I was older when I got it – because I think it might have knocked me off my feet when I was younger. It funny because I know it was good and I know it brought me a lot more readers, but it doesn’t feel particularly real.” She felt a similar way about the Emmy award-winning HBO TV version that followed, with Frances McDormand as Olive Kitteridge. “I just loved it. But it didn’t feel like it had much to do with me. Every so often I would recognise – Oh, I made that man, I wrote that! – I know what happens next!” Olive – recalcitrant, blunt and an often impossible wife and mother – is an indelible creation, offering an implicit “hell bells” (her favoured expletive) to the fallacy that female characters should be “likable”. She is something much more compelling than likable, she real. Strout recounts her astonishment at meeting a group of young women in Connecticut, “affluent, all skinny little things”, who held weekly “Olive meetings” at Starbucks. “I was thrilled! I thought, ‘That fabulous that Olive speaks to them.’ I think there must be a lot of things that people don’t say that Olive says for them.” The story in which she steals her new daughter-in-law bra and shoe and subtly defaces one of her sweaters, for example, still impels confessions from readers. “People – women – will say to me, ‘How did you know?’ And the conspiratorial look they give me makes me realise if they haven’t done that, they want to.” It fabulous that Olive speaks to women. I think there must be a&nbsp;lot of things people don’t say that she says for them So much of the power of Olive Kitteridge – and of My Name Is Lucy Barton – comes from Strout resistance to sentimentality. It is, she thinks, “a cheap route to something and that not what I want to do. I don’t want to write melodrama; I’m not interested in good and bad, I’m interested in all those little ripples that we all live with. And I think that if one gets a truthful emotion down, or a truthful something down, it is timeless.” Strout still thinks of herself as having “excessive emotion”: “Ageing doesn’t seem to have taken care of any of those problems. I still feel like I’m dripping with emotion. But the work distils it. It good for me.” And yet: “There are times when I have thought, ‘What have I done? I’ve just written some books.’ There so much awful stuff out there and maybe I should have been doing something more actively. But ever since I was young, I have seen writing as trying to help people. That sounds so corny but that really what I see as my job – trying to open somebody eyes just a little bit for one minute. So, yeah, there are times I think, ‘This is foolish,’ but I don’t know that it any more foolish than any other acts of trying to help the world.” My Name Is Lucy Barton is published Viking To order a copy for go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call Free UK p&amp;p over online orders only.

85,"n June the&nbsp;American novelist John Williams wrote from the University of Denver, where he was a professor of English, to his agent Marie Rodell. She had just read&nbsp;his third novel, Stoner , and while&nbsp;clearly admiring it, was also warning him not to get his hopes up.&nbsp;Williams replied: ""I suspect that I&nbsp;agree&nbsp;with you about the commercial possibilities; but I also suspect that the&nbsp;novel may surprise us in this respect. Oh, I have no illusions that it&nbsp;will be a 'bestseller' or anything like that; but if it is handled right (there always that out) – that is, if it is not treated as just another 'academic novel' by the publisher, as Butcher Crossing [his&nbsp;second novel] was treated as a ""western"", it might have a respectable sale. The only thing I'm sure of is that it a good novel; in time it may even be thought of as a&nbsp;substantially good one."" How familiar the thought, and the tone, of this will be to almost every practising novelist. The expression of confidence in your own work, without which you would never have started; the wariness in the face of the bitch goddess Success; the caution in raising expectation, but the further caution in not raising it too high; and, finally, the writer everlasting ""out"" – that if it all goes wrong, it probably someone else fault. Stoner was published in and –&nbsp;as is usually the case – it steered a&nbsp;mid‑course between the novelist fears and his hopes. It was respectably reviewed; it had a reasonable sale; it&nbsp;did not become a bestseller; it went&nbsp;out of print. In Augustus , Williams ""Roman"" novel, won half the National Book Award for fiction (the other half going to John Barth Chimera ). It was his largest moment of&nbsp;public success, yet he did not even attend the ceremony; perhaps he was rightly suspicious, as the laudatum pronounced in his absence was strangely disparaging. When he died, two decades later, without publishing any more fiction, the New York Times obituarist treated him as much as a&nbsp;poet and ""educator"" as a novelist. But&nbsp;still to come was that factor – identified by Williams in his letter – that novelists often write about, that they fear, but also place their trust in: time. And time&nbsp;has vindicated him way beyond his own modest hope.&nbsp;Fifty years after Williams wrote&nbsp;to his agent, Stoner became a&nbsp;bestseller. A&nbsp;quite unexpected bestseller. A&nbsp;bestseller across Europe. A bestseller publishers themselves could not quite understand. A bestseller of the purest kind – one caused almost entirely by word-of-mouth among readers. I remember unwrapping my copy of&nbsp;the novel back in March. Like many writers, I get sent far more books than I&nbsp;can possibly read, and the process of&nbsp;triage can be brutal. So: a new paperback (from my own publishers) with a large front-cover strap reading ""VINTAGE WILLIAMS"". No Christian name. Raymond Williams? William Carlos Williams? Rowan Williams? Check the spine: John Williams. The classical guitarist? The composer of film music? Neither. Rather, a novel published in the by a dead American I'd never heard of. And then the title: Stoner . Hmmm: were we in for some tranced and tedious discussion of the merits of Moroccan versus Colombian gold? But there was an introduction (and therefore a recommendation) by John McGahern , so it got the first-page test. And Stoner turned out to be the name of the main character, which was&nbsp;a relief. And the prose was clean and quiet; and the tone a little wry. And the first page led to the second, and then what happened was that joyful internal word-of-mouth that sends a reader hurrying from one page to the next; which in turn leads to external word-of-mouth, the pressing of the book on friends, the ordering and sending of copies. William Stoner, we learn in the book first paragraph, was a lifelong academic, who entered the University of Missouri as a student in and went on to teach there until his death in The value and purpose of academe is a key concern of the novel, while one of its main sequences describes a long and savage piece of departmental infighting. So Williams was perhaps a little naive, or at least over-hopeful, in thinking his novel wouldn't, or shouldn't, be labelled ""academic"". In the same way, Butcher Crossing (to be reissued by Vintage in January) is indeed a ""western"", being set in a Kansas frontier town in the with its main action a buffalo hunt in a lost mountain valley as winter approaches. It is so historically and anatomically precise, I am confident that, if you gave me a sharp knife, a horse and a rope, I could now skin a buffalo (though someone else would have to kill it first). Butcher Crossing is a very good ""western"", as&nbsp; Stoner is a very good ""academic novel"" – and, in each case, being ""very good"" means that the novels slip their identifying tag. Stoner is a farm boy, initially studying agriculture and a requirement of his course is to take a class in English literature. The students are set two Shakespeare plays, and then some sonnets, including the Asked to elucidate the poem by an impatient and sardonic professor, Stoner finds himself tongue-tied and embarrassed, unable to say more than ""It means … it&nbsp;means …"" And yet, something has happened within him: an epiphany rooted less in a moment of understanding than of not understanding. He has realised that there is something out there which, if he can seize it, will&nbsp;unlock not just literature but life itself; and in advance of such future understanding, he already feels his humanity awakened, and a new kinship with those around him. His&nbsp;life&nbsp;will change utterly from this moment: he will discover ""a sense of&nbsp;wonder"" at grammar, and grasp how&nbsp;literature changes the world even&nbsp;as it describes it. He becomes a&nbsp;teacher,""which was simply a man to&nbsp;whom his book is true, to whom is given a&nbsp;dignity of art that has little to do with&nbsp;his foolishness or weakness or&nbsp;inadequacy as a man"". Towards the end of his life, when he has endured many disappointments, he thinks of academe as ""the only life that had not&nbsp;betrayed him"". And he understands also that there is a continual battle between the academy and the world: the academy must keep the world, and its values, out for as long as&nbsp;possible. Stoner is a son of the soil – patient, earnest and enduring – who moves unprepared into the city and the world.&nbsp;Williams is wonderful at human&nbsp;awkwardness, at physical and&nbsp;emotional shyness, at not speaking your mind or your heart, either because you cannot articulate them, or&nbsp;because you simply cannot follow what has happened, or both: And so, like many others, their honeymoon was a failure; yet they would not admit this to themselves, and they did not realise the significance of the failure&nbsp;until long afterward. Good things do happen in Stoner life, but they all end badly. He relishes teaching students, but his career is stymied by a malevolent head of department; he falls in love and marries, but knows within a month that the relationship is a failure; he adores his daughter, but she is turned against him; he is given sudden new life by an affair, but finds love vulnerable to outside interference, just&nbsp;as the academy is vulnerable to the&nbsp;world. Aged he reflects that ""he&nbsp;could see nothing before him that he wished to enjoy and little behind him that he cared to remember"". Though he is allowed small victories towards the end of the novel, they are pyrrhic ones. The pains of lost and thwarted love have tested Stoner reserves of stoicism to the full; and you&nbsp;might well conclude that his life must be accounted pretty much a&nbsp;failure. But, if so, you would not have&nbsp;Williams on your side. In one of&nbsp;his rare interviews, he commented of his protagonist: ""I think he a real hero. A&nbsp;lot of people who have read the&nbsp;novel think that Stoner had such a&nbsp;sad and bad life. I think he had a very&nbsp;good life. He had a better life than&nbsp;most&nbsp;people do, certainly. He was&nbsp;doing what he wanted to do, he had some feeling for what he was doing, he&nbsp;had some sense of the importance of the job he was doing … The important thing in the novel to me&nbsp;is Stoner sense of a job … a job in&nbsp;the good and honourable sense&nbsp;of the word. His job gave him a&nbsp;particular kind of identity and made him what he&nbsp;was."" Writers often disagree with readers about the emphasis of their work. Even&nbsp;so, it a surprise that Williams seems surprised that others might find&nbsp;Stoner life ""sad"". He himself was&nbsp;more than aware of its likely effect.&nbsp;In&nbsp;that letter to Rodell, he writes: ""One&nbsp;afternoon a few weeks ago, I&nbsp;walked in on my typist (a junior history major, and pretty average, I'm&nbsp;afraid) while she was finishing typing chapter and discovered great&nbsp;huge tears coursing down her cheeks. I&nbsp;shall love her for ever."" The sadness of Stoner is of its own particular kind. It is not, say, the operatic sadness of The Good Soldier , or the grindingly sociological sadness of New Grub Street . It feels a purer, less&nbsp;literary kind, closer to life true sadness. As a reader, you can see it coming in the way you can often see life sadness coming, knowing there is&nbsp;little you can do about it. Except – since you are a reader – you can at least defer it. I found that when reading Stoner for the first time, I would limit myself most days to or pages, preferring to put off until the morrow knowledge of what Stoner might next have to bear. The title – suggested by his American publishers – remains unexciting (though better, probably, than Williams first attempts: A Flaw of&nbsp;Light and The Matter of Love). Still, a book makes its title, rather than the other way round. And what the book has turned into is more than one more forgotten work gratifyingly exhumed. When a novel by, say, Henry Green or Patrick Hamilton is ""rediscovered"", the&nbsp;graph of sales usually forms a brief, respectable hump before returning again to the horizontal. Stoner first went into Vintage in after McGahern had recommended it to the&nbsp;publisher Robin Robertson . In the&nbsp;decade up to it sold copies, and by the end of last year was trundling along in print-on-demand. This year, up to the end of November, it has sold copies, with the vast majority – of them – coming since June. It was the novel sudden success in&nbsp;France in that alerted other publishers to its possibilities; since then it has sold copies in Holland and in Italy. It has been&nbsp;a bestseller in Israel, and is just beginning to take off in Germany. Though Williams died in his widow is, happily, still alive to enjoy the worldwide royalties. Rights have now been sold in and Stoner is soon to be launched on China. There is a further oddity about the revival of Stoner : it seems to be a purely European (and Israeli) phenomenon so&nbsp;far. Bret Easton Ellis has tweeted its praise, and Tom Hanks has applauded it, but these have been rare American voices in its favour. When I asked around among my American literary friends, some had simply never heard of&nbsp;the novel, nor of Williams, and others were lukewarm in their response. Lorrie Moore praise was carefully qualified: "" Stoner is such an interesting phenomenon. It is a terrific and terrifically sad little book, but the way it has taken off&nbsp;in the UK is a bit of a head-scratcher for&nbsp;most American writers, who find it lovely, flawed, engagingly written, and minor rather than great."" This disparity needs some explanation, and I'm not sure I can supply it. Perhaps Europeans are more open to&nbsp;the quietness of the novel than Americans. Perhaps Americans have read more novels that resemble Stoner &nbsp;than we have (though what they&nbsp;might be I can't think). Perhaps American readers don't like its lack of&nbsp;""optimism"" (there is no shortage of pessimism in American literature, but&nbsp;the national character is one of striving, of altering circumstances, rather than accepting them). Or perhaps they are merely lagging behind us, and will soon catch&nbsp;up. When I put these points to the novelist Sylvia Brownrigg , she responded: ""The&nbsp;reticence seems very&nbsp;not American to me. In spite of&nbsp;the American setting, the character himself feels more English, or European – opaque, fundamentally decent,and passive … Perhaps the lack&nbsp;of the novel taking hold in the US&nbsp;is&nbsp;because it doesn't feel like One of&nbsp;Ours? We're such a country of maximalists, noisy ones, and though obviously there are exceptions, even our minimalists are not spare and sad in this particular way … Another thought crossed my mind: that there is&nbsp;little drinking in Stoner . I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;American characters who are self-contained and stoical (I am thinking of&nbsp; Carver , or Richard Yates ) more often have to be alcoholics to rein&nbsp;themselves in, and accept their disappointments."" Whatever the reasons for its cooler reception in the US, I don't agree that the novel is ""minor""; nor do I think it is&nbsp;""great"" in the way that, say, Gatsby or Updike Rabbit quartet are great. I&nbsp;think Williams himself got it right: it&nbsp;is ""substantially good"". It is good, and it&nbsp;has considerable substance, and gravity, and continuation in the mind afterwards. And it is a true ""reader novel"", in the sense that its narrative reinforces the very value of reading and study. Many will be reminded of their own lectoral epiphanies, of those moments when the magic of literature first made some kind of distant sense, first suggested that this might be the best way of understanding life. And readers are also aware that this sacred inner space, in which reading and ruminating and being oneself happen, is increasingly threatened by what Stoner refers to as ""the world"" – which is nowadays full of hectic interference with, and constant surveillance of, the individual. Perhaps something of this anxiety lies behind the renaissance of the novel. But you should – indeed must – find out for yourself.",2322,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/13/stoner-john-williams-julian-barnes
86,"A good friend recently became a better one still by urging me to read Jane Bowles , whose writing inspired her husband Paul, previously known as a composer, to take up prose. Jane Bowles (née Auer), who was born in New York in and died in Malaga in wrote comparatively little – one novel ( La Phaeton Hypocrite, a piece of juvenilia, notwithstanding), one play, and one short story collection – but her small oeuvre is distinguished by its quality and innovation. The stories that make up Plain Pleasures, written between and are typical in their juxtaposing of domineering and weak women, and frequent preoccupation with moments of psychological crisis. There might be nothing distinctive about that, perhaps, but Bowles ability to convey a mind in flux is powerfully discomfiting. In part this is due to the feeling, which infuses her stories, that such a chaotic state is a more or less permanent feature of existence. Some argue that the alienation forced on her by her sexuality was partially responsible for this, but both her unconventional marriage (she and Paul were bisexual, with Paul preferring men and Jane women) and life in Tangiers afforded relative freedom in this regard. A more interesting explanation was suggested by Paul Bowles – always an astute judge of Jane work – in a interview with Oliver Evans, when he noted her ability ""to see the drama that is really in front of one every minute – the drama that follows living"". Navigating by such lights, her fiction charts some of the territory explored by Katherine Mansfield, Virginia Woolf and Jean Rhys. Her style, however, is closer to the reportorial terseness of Hemingway, but leavened with a dry wit that his prose lacks. Humour is superficial in Bowles work, however. Much like the waterfall through whose roar Sadie, the doomed spinster in Camp Cataract believes she can hear ""someone pronounce her name in a dismal tone"", the febrile thoughts of her characters seem to be suspended above yawning depths. Blank stares and non sequiturs abound, from the moment where Señora Ramirez memory ""seemed suddenly to have failed her"" during the seduction in A Guatemalan Idyll to the bizarrely stuttering, ambiguously homoerotic conversation between an American and a Moroccan in Everything Is Nice According to Truman Capote, Bowles found writing ""difficult to the point of true pain"". Paul Bowles concurred, remarking in an interview that it ""cost her blood to write … Sometimes it took her a week to write a page"". She preferred socialising, drinking, conversation and promiscuity. Her original impulse to write was inspired by sociability, following as it did a meeting with Louis-Ferdinand Céline on a transatlantic crossing when she was But her difficulties were as much a product of an uncompromising determination to avoid convention as they were the result of being temperamentally unsuited to the writer lifestyle. For all that, though, the chief reason for Bowles modest output was a terrible series of strokes, the first of which she suffered in Morocco in After this she was incapable of producing anything of worth and, already an alcoholic, proceeded to drink so much that her lucid spells occurred only between periods of insanity and something resembling a vegetative state. In her preface to My Sister Hand in Mine, the collected edition of Bowles work, Joy Williams notes that writing ""had to be difficult from the first paragraph in order for her to have respect for it"". however, such things were beyond the reach of her crippled faculties. In a letter to the poet Ruth Fainlight, Bowles wrote: ""I haven't the energy to read since it always a bit difficult for me because of the hemianopia trouble resulting from the stroke which you know about and which, although it is a thousand times improved, slows down my reading so much that I fall asleep with the light on. I managed to stay awake for one week reading a book called Plain Girl, a book for children with large print."" Following the publication of her magnificent novel Two Serious Ladies in Bowles outlined her concerns regarding her isolation in a letter to her husband: ""I am serious but I am isolated and my experience is probably of no interest at this point to anyone."" Despite Capote, Tennessee Williams, Carson McCullers and John Ashbery all professing their admiration, Bowles was never widely read. As the latter noted in a New York Times article, ""When a London publisher wanted to reprint [Two Serious Ladies] three years ago, even Mrs Bowles was unable to supply him with a copy."" Although things are better now, it seems likely she will remain a cult interest; a major talent with a minor readership.

87,"n one of his more pontifical essays, TS Eliot declared that a poet could not be considered great unless he&nbsp;–&nbsp; he , necessarily – had produced an epic. The pronouncement takes for granted that there is general agreement on what constitutes an epic. But is there? Homer Iliad , Virgil Aeneid , Dante Divine Comedy , certainly; but what about, say, Alexander Pope The Rape of the Lock , Louis MacNeice Autumn Journal , Basil Bunting Briggflatts , or even Philip Larkin The Whitsun Weddings ? An epic does not have to be of epic proportions, nor does it need to take the lofty classical tone; it can be humble, like us, composed, as WH Auden has it, of Eros and of dust. In The Long Take , which has an epical feel, Robin Robertson , one of the finest lyric poets of our time, deploys his artistic reach in a fiction narrative of more&nbsp;than pages, composed in a&nbsp;mixture of verse and prose. It&nbsp;is a beautiful, vigorous and achingly melancholy hymn to the common man that is as unexpected as it&nbsp;is daring. Here we have a poet at the peak of his symphonic powers taking a great risk, and succeeding gloriously. Robertson sings of arms and the man, though his model is not Virgil but the movies, and in particular the black-and-white (or soot-and-silver) masterpieces produced by Hollywood in, roughly, the latter half of the and first half of the such as Out of the Past , Kiss Me Deadly and The Big Combo . As Walter Friedländer, who was an émigré professor at Berkeley, California, and makes a brief appearance, gleefully observes of these films, “At last! / German Expressionism meets the American Dream!” Robertson protagonist, Walker, is an emblematic figure, one of the walking wounded who survived D-Day and the invasion of Europe and returned home to find themselves outcasts in a world busy again with its perennial pursuit of money and power, and impatient of yesterday superfluous heroes. A&nbsp;Nova Scotian, Walker remembers home with hallucinatory clarity – “The frozen harbor like a terrible accident: as if some ballroom chandeliers had fallen, leaving smashed shards of inch-thick ice” – but knows he cannot go back there, not after the things he has seen, the things he has done. He is, in his way, as much a casualty of war as the friends and foes who died in the slaughterhouse that was the coast of Normandy in the summer of Robertson, who must have given years to researching his material, writes of war with appalling immediacy, surveying the carnage with a calmly Homeric eye. His battle scenes are composed not of titanic struggles but, much more tellingly, of fleeting, unforgettable glimpses, lit as by the light of shellbursts: “Naked soldiers dead on the beach, clothes blown off by an anti-tank mine. I was staring at their crew-cuts washed flat by each wave, then the hairs springing back up.” Walker postwar odyssey takes him first to New York, which yields a magnificent opening flourish to the book: And there it was: the swell and glitter of it like a standing wave – the fabled, smoking ruin, the new towers rising through the blue, the ranked array of ivory and gold, the glint, the glamour of buried light as the world turned round it very slowly this autumn morning, all amazed. Three cities, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, form the scarred and tattered backdrop of the narrative: “Cities are a kind of war, he thought: / sometimes very far away then, quickly, very close.” Walker heads to California as a result of a chance meeting in a New York bar with the film noir director Robert Siodmak . The long train journey west – “like his life, going by too fast” – is a tour de force of narrative verse writing; The Long Take , like Nabokov Lolita , is rapturously in love with America, that great, sad, sprawling, lovely land, in all its aspects, even the cheap and tawdry. Crossing the desert, Walker encounters Palm Springs : “In this place, the sand-traps are the only things that are real.” Poem of the week: Finding the Keys by Robin Robertson In Los Angeles, he makes a friend, the fictitious Billy Idaho, a fellow veteran, who “was black, small and wiry, bright-eyed”, and who will come to a ghastly end; there are acquaintances, too, reporters on the newspaper where he finds a job, writing features about the&nbsp;denizens of Skid Row, many of them soldiers like himself, adrift in a peacetime in which there are “no&nbsp;jobs for us, the guys who fought, y’know, / fought for freedom”. Down there, in the lower depths, Walker hears the siren call of self-destructive repentance for what he has done in the war, a call that in the end he will have no choice but to heed: “I can stop now,” he said, putting his mouth to the mouth of the bottle, “I’ll make my city here.” The Long Take is a masterly work of art, exciting, colourful, fast-paced – the old-time movie reviewer vocabulary is apt to the case – and almost unbearably moving. Walker is a wonderful invention, a decent man carrying the canker of a past sin for which he cannot forgive himself. What Siodmak says of Walker can also be said of Robertson, that he has “what we call / deep focus. Long eyes for seeing.” John Banville latest novel is Mrs Osmond (Viking) .

88,"ome weeks into the compilation of our nonfiction classics list, one mischievous colleague with a penchant for the arcane posed this wild-card challenge: “So what are you going to do about Betty McDonald?”&nbsp; “Who she?” “Haven’t you read&nbsp; The Egg &amp; I ?” In Betty McDonald whimsical autobiography was as popular as baked beans; now it almost completely forgotten, but, tellingly, still in print. Alas, after an hour or two with&nbsp; The Egg &amp; I , it was excruciatingly obvious that Betty McDonald book is not a classic. On some weeks, there might be as many as five competing challenges for each nonfiction slot, but rarely as straightforward as this. Literary classics cluster on the north face of Parnassus. For this vertiginous terrain there are different sherpas. Italo Calvino says that a classic is “a book that has never finished what it wants to say”. Ezra Pound identifies “a certain eternal and irresponsible freshness”; TS Eliot, much more astringent, observed in&nbsp; The Sacred Wood &nbsp;that “no modern language can hope to produce a classic, in the sense I have called Virgil a classic”.&nbsp;Alan Bennett wryly notes: “Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have.” Among nonfiction classics, the most treacherous category is that creature beloved of publishers – “the contemporary classic”. A second cousin to that notorious impostor is the “instant classic”. Such books will have been judged by slippery criteria: popular and literary critical fashion, a changing marketplace and new technology, bestseller lists and hype. In the&nbsp;past years, a familiar palette of blurbish adjectives has given shape and colour to a moving target: provocative, outrageous, prophetic, groundbreaking, funny, disturbing, revolutionary, moving, inspiring, life-changing, subversive… The best nonfiction books: No – The History of the World by Walter Raleigh This list raises another troubling question: is nonfiction “the new fiction”? There are some good writers who will argue that this is so, but I believe that nonfiction (which can sometimes successfully bring together many genres) is not, strictly speaking, a genre of its own. Creatively – yes – using narrative techniques borrowed from fiction, it possible to give certain kinds of nonfiction the aura of a distinct new genre. Yet, at the end of the day, “nonfiction” fractures into time-hallowed categories such as philosophy, memoir, history, reportage and poetry (see below), etc. This is particularly true of “nonfiction classics” from the titles such as&nbsp; A Treatise of Human Nature &nbsp;by David Hume or&nbsp; On Liberty&nbsp; by JS Mill. By that yardstick, a recent classic will be quite distinct, chiefly because its literary and cultural milieu is so different.&nbsp; Literature always mirrors social and political upheaval. In a rare, and possibly thrilling, moment of historical disruption, our cultural matrix is so much in flux that we’d be wise to rule nothing out. While multicultural diversity slowly transforms the canon, new&nbsp;readers coming of age are likely to frame “nonfiction” in a new way. As Kazuo Ishiguro said this month in Stockholm, during his Nobel prize&nbsp;lecture:&nbsp; “We must take great care not to set too narrowly or conservatively our definitions of what constitutes good literature. The next generation will come with all sorts of new, sometimes bewildering ways to tell important and wonderful stories. We must keep our minds open to them, especially regarding genre and form, so that we can nurture and celebrate the best of them. Good writing and good reading will break down barriers. We may even find a new idea, a great humane vision, around which to rally.” Definitions of “good literature” start with critics and publishers. In the UK, the book industry is just beginning to reject&nbsp;patterns of exclusion that permeate the literary establishment. A Spread the Word report has already drawn attention to the dominance of white, middle-class males not merely in&nbsp;festivals and prizes but also in the upper echelons of book publishing. Penguin, Faber and Bloomsbury (to name three) are now addressing the issue of diversity in their commissioning cadres.&nbsp;Diversify the editors and you will diversify the books. Disruption plus innovation equals confusion: we have been here before. In the spring of a young and iconoclastic Oscar Wilde,&nbsp;writing in the &nbsp;Pall Mall Gazette , declared: “Books today may be conveniently divided into three classes.” There were, he went on, “books to read” and “books to reread”. Finally, there were “books not to read at all… argumentative books and books that try to prove anything.” This, Wilde decided, was “an age that reads so much that it has no time to admire and writes so much that it has no time to think”. His solution was typically Wildean. “Whosoever will select out of the chaos of our modern curricula ‘The Worst Books’, and publish a list of them, will confer on the rising generation a real and lasting benefit.” Your list-maker will have the appetites of a butterfly-collector, the instincts of a gambler, the mind of a missionary… The Observer two series (fiction and nonfiction) have had more serious intentions.&nbsp;In the first, my choice of classic novels, a taxonomic spree could become quite an elevated discussion, based on comparative criticism. For my nonfiction classics, the debate has been broader.&nbsp;Where fiction is a discrete and well-defined genre with established criteria, as manageable and satisfying as a spacious country house garden, “nonfiction” remains the wild west. To put it another way: choosing it becomes an infuriating case of “As I Please”, driven by whim and caprice as much as taste.&nbsp;One thing is certain: the classic in all genres must, uniquely, express something about its subject in a way that was previously unexpressed. It must, in Pound famous injunction, “make it new”. Read it for the first time now and still be thrilled by its vigour, originality and wisdom. Nevertheless, simple criteria cannot disguise the obvious and inescapable fact that our nonfiction list first appeared in the pages of a British national newspaper during the years It has, for instance, been interesting to discover how some of these classics, unforced, speak quite directly to the twin challenges of Trump and Brexit. Your list-maker, then, is a creature of his or her times. They will have the appetites of a butterfly-collector, the instincts of a gambler, and the mind of a missionary or saboteur – perhaps with more than a hint of the cultural dictator. They are also part anthologist and part antiquarian. There an additional difficulty. As every week roster of online comments indicates, almost any selection of “classic nonfiction” from library shelves that include history, film, biography, cookery, politics, fashion, sociology, art history, reportage, feminism, drama, biology, philosophy, economics and poetry (which I included because poetry is catalogued as “nonfiction” by most libraries) is going to be either perverse and disappointing, or stupid and enraging, or downright baffling.&nbsp; When a nonfiction classic is whatever takes your fancy, according to your own self-imposed criteria, then the subtitle to such a project might be “Anything Goes”. It could be a book that reported a great revolution – John Reed&nbsp; Ten Days That Shook the World &nbsp;– or a masterpiece of magazine journalism that exposed the truth about a humanitarian catastrophe such as John Hersey&nbsp; Hiroshima . Some of the classics catalogued here have caused shock and outrage: Carson&nbsp; Silent Spring , for example, or Said&nbsp; Orientalism .&nbsp;Others, notably Berlin&nbsp; The Hedgehog and the Fox , and de Quincey&nbsp; Confessions , I’ve listed as diversions. Still others – Greer &nbsp;The Female Eunuch &nbsp;or Friedan&nbsp; The Feminine Mystique –&nbsp;have broken down barriers and turned worlds upside down. Some titles ( A Grief Observed ; A Room of One Own ) have expressed a new idea sotto voce; others at maximum decibels: &nbsp;A Vindication of the Rights of Women ,&nbsp; The Double Helix , The Making of the English Working Class &nbsp;and Common Sense. &nbsp;Some classics live on, imperishably, as works of sheer entertainment: How to Cook a Wolf&nbsp; or&nbsp; Eminent Victorians ,&nbsp; Domestic Manners of the Americans , and &nbsp;Goodbye to All That . Some classics were written in extremis and carry their scars all too visibly ( Dispatches , Birthday Letters , De Profundis ); others are more reflective ( The Uses of Literacy ;&nbsp; Awakenings ). Every one is original and speaks for itself. All writers, great and small, commune with the dead. One unintended pleasure of the reading for this list was uncovering the interplay within the Anglo-American tradition: Jefferson nodding to Locke, Orwell to Swift and Hughes to Shakespeare. Towards the end of the series, I chanced upon&nbsp; The Oxford Book of English Prose edited by the late and great John Gross. Working on this list, I had strenuously avoided making comparisons with similar exercises. Now, with almost all my entries read and written, I could not resist a sneak peek at some tantalising alternatives. Should we have neglected William Morris, John Ruskin and Fraser&nbsp; Golden Bough ? How could we have omitted Neville Cardus, Rebecca West and Nirad Chaudhuri ? &nbsp; The Oxford Book of English Prose&nbsp; has more than entries. We had just slots to play with. Furthermore, our list has been compiled for a weekly newspaper audience, with the added gimmick that it unspools backwards in a reverse chronological sequence: it was always intended to entertain, tantalise and provoke. And there is, of course, no accounting for taste, the intangible thing we inherit that has been shaped by character, education, class, gender and race. The best nonfiction books: No – The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert Such influences marked the crossroads of a fierce internal debate. Would it be possible, I often asked myself, to reshape the contours of the canon by assertively promoting forgotten kinds of writer? If there was a choice, say, between a neglected female writer and a dead white male, should I automatically favour the former? And what about writers of colour? What about African American&nbsp;slaves such as Olaudah&nbsp;Equiano ? If we are true to the historical record, the inconvenient truth is that such affirmative action on behalf of the forgotten and the ignored becomes mission impossible. Lists such as this one (and its fiction predecessor) cannot escape the past. From a perspective, those times do not make a pretty sight. The history of our literature is shaped by patriarchal traditions and Anglo-Saxon attitudes or, to put it another way, xenophobia, misogyny, racism, religious intolerance and sexism.&nbsp; Before the there are very few published women and virtually no English language writers from India, Africa or the far east. That not a complacent assertion, but a simple statement of fact. The alternative titles one would need to construct an alternative canon simply do not exist. Where they do, as in the case of African Americans such as Equiano, they are in a minority. Even to list the&nbsp;outstanding half-a-dozen African American writers of consequence is still hardly to redress the injustices of the past. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the evolution of English and American prose, there are at least three turning points in our literature. First, there the shift from the courtly, Latinate eloquence of Bacon, Donne and Milton towards the crisper, vernacular clarity of Pepys, Defoe and the notable writers of a self-confident Great Britain. Between the years from the Restoration to the Glorious Revolution, English prose becomes plainer, more demotic and robust – to suit the times.&nbsp; A hundred years later, there the dramatic expansion of English&nbsp;as a future world language after the American revolution.&nbsp;Finally, during the last century, as English culture, disseminated by colonialism, began to flourish worldwide and find&nbsp;local Indian and African expression, the Anglo-American hegemony starts to morph into a&nbsp;more global expression of English, infused by the literary traditions of India, Australia and the far east, Canada and sub-Saharan Africa. In our own century, this process is ongoing… Some readers referred darkly to my egregious omissions, but rarely supplied persuasive alternatives.&nbsp;Generally, the level of below-the-line commentary generated more heat than light. There were, however, many excellent contributions and, where possible, I adjusted the selection to answer a good suggestion. Some tough decisions were very tough: Cyril Connolly had to be on my list, but to prefer Enemies of Promise over&nbsp; The Unquiet Grave&nbsp; was painful. JM Keynes&nbsp; The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money , published in in the depths of the Great Depression, is beyond question a landmark volume of the But every nominated author is only allowed one title, so I chose the less well-known but more readable Keynes essay,&nbsp; The Economic Consequences of the Peace .&nbsp; Then there the Thorstein Veblen question. The neurotic author of&nbsp; The Theory of the Leisure Class (as well as the far-seeing&nbsp; The Engineers and the Price System , Veblen is remembered as a cantankerous theorist with a penchant for the wives of his colleagues on the Stanford campus. Among many phrases, he coined “conspicuous consumption” and is a guru of American technology, but his books now seem weirdly dated. Veblen – in or out? In golfing parlance, he did not survive the cut. Other serious regrets include: Robert Hooke:&nbsp; Micrographia ; Alexander Pope:&nbsp; An Essay on Man ;&nbsp;JH Newman:&nbsp; Apologia Pro Vita Sua ; Marie Stopes:&nbsp; Married Love ; CLR James: The Black Jacobins ; Nancy Mitford:&nbsp; Madame de Pompadour , Noblesse Oblige ; Julia Child:&nbsp; Mastering the Art of French Cooking ; Ronald Blythe:&nbsp; Akenfield ; Hannah Arendt: Eichmann in Jerusalem ; Hunter S Thompson Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ;&nbsp;Francis Fukuyama:&nbsp; The End of History ; Vance Packard:&nbsp; The Hidden Persuaders ; DW Winnicott: The Child, the Family and the Outside World ; Alex Comfort: The Joy of Sex ; Paul Fussell: The Great War and Modern Memory ; George Steiner:&nbsp; Language and Silence ; Richard Mabey:&nbsp; Flora Britannica ; and William Goldman:&nbsp; Adventures in the Screen Trade . Working backwards into the past, the list evolved from week to week. Some choices reflect the zeitgeist.&nbsp;The passage of time will undoubtedly winnow a lot of titles inspired by the Great War once that apocalypse takes its long-term place in history. The year marked a turning point. A “modern classic” may easily get forgotten; a or classic will be part of the canon almost by definition. As survivors from another age, such books have a special consequence. Among classics, it more difficult to achieve both influence and true greatness, though&nbsp; The Waste Land &nbsp;is a title with a strong claim on posterity. What do I take away from nearly five years on the north face of Parnassus? The vitality, richness, depth and variety of the Anglo-American literary tradition continues to astonish. And because it has shaped who we are, and why we are here, it also educates and instructs. At times a chore, occasionally a headache and always a looming deadline, I would not have missed it. Now it time to move on. Sometimes, I wonder what such an exercise will look like in For now, this list will survive online, a snapshot of taste at the beginning of the It will, no doubt, continue to provoke and infuriate. That partly its raison d’etre. More seriously, it will also continue to mine a treasury of prose that has been seasoned by adversity, guarded by devoted readers of all kinds, and cherished for expressing the shock of the new, in the greatest language the world has ever known.",2548,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/31/how-i-chose-my-list-of-100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time-robert-mccrum
89,"he human animal knows that it is born to age and die. Together with language, this knowledge is what separates us from all other species. Yet, until the century, not even Aristotle, who speculated about most things, actually considered the possibility of extinction. This is all the more surprising because “the end of the world” is an archetypal theme with a sonorous label – eschatology – that morphs in popular culture into many doomsday scenarios, from global warming to the third world war. Citizens of the century now face a proliferating menu of possible future dooms. Elizabeth Kolbert The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History is both a highly intelligent expression of this genre and also supremely well executed and entertaining. Her book , which follows her global warming report Field Notes from a Catastrophe is already set to become a contemporary classic, and an excellent place to start this new series of landmark nonfiction titles in the English language. The best nonfiction books of all time On the opening page of her investigation into the future of our planet, Kolbert quotes the great biologist EO Wilson: “If there is danger in the human trajectory, it is not so much in the survival of our own species as in the fulfilment of the ultimate irony of organic evolution: that in the instant of achieving self-understanding through the mind of man, life has doomed its most beautiful creations.” This warning note sets the mood for the chapters that follow, an urgent contemporary report on “the sixth extinction”. Kolbert perspective is both awe-inspiring and fearsome, but utterly engrossing, as you’d expect from a book whose premise is “we’re all doomed”. During the past half billion years, she tells us, there have been five mass extinctions on Earth, when “the planet has undergone change so wrenching that the diversity of life has plummeted”. The history of these catastrophic events, notes Kolbert, tends to be recaptured just as humanity comes to realise that it is about to cause another one. Sure enough, in our postmillennial century, she finds that scientists around the world are now monitoring the next mass extinction, possibly the biggest devastation since an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. With this difference: the impending cataclysm is… us. Part of Kolbert concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction, a comparatively recent idea In emblematic episodes, exquisitely narrated, Kolbert, a magazine journalist with the New Yorker , explores the possibility of our impending doom through the lives of, for instance, the Panamanian golden frog , the Sumatran rhino and the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui, “the most beautiful bird in the world”. Part of Kolbert concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction. While the concept, as she puts it, “may be the first scientific idea that kids have to grapple with”, as they play with their toy dinosaurs, Kolbert instructs that, actually, it a comparatively recent idea that dates to Enlightenment France. Until this moment in the western intellectual tradition, not even Aristotle (in his History of Animals ) had so much as considered the possibility that animals had a past. Later, in Roman times, Pliny Natural History includes descriptions of animals that are real, or fabulous, but none that are extinct. The word “fossil” was used to describe anything dug from the ground, as in “fossil fuel”. Even Carl Linnaeus, who pioneered his system of binomial nomenclature in the century, catalogued only one kind of animal – those that exist. It was the discovery of some American mastodon bones in what is now Ohio, during the early century – an unintended consequence of French colonial exploration – that subsequently inspired Georges Cuvier, an anatomist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, to ask the essential question: “What was this primitive Earth? … And what revolution was able to wipe it out?” Revolutionary France celebrated the rights of man. Cuvier was never going to recognise the truth about some later extinctions: that Homo sapiens is the problem, not the solution. Addressing the imminent next catastrophe with a certain grim relish, Kolbert spells out the results of her investigations: “One-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater molluscs, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed towards oblivion,” she declares, during the course of her odyssey through our natural world and its human-inspired devastation. Kolbert indictment of humanity is remorseless, and compelling: “The losses are occurring all over: in the South Pacific, in the North Atlantic, in the Arctic and in the Sahel, in lakes and on islands, on mountaintops and in valleys.” Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species Readers of The Sixth Extinction will be unable to evade the conclusion that we do indeed find ourselves on the brink of a great catastrophe, one in which the agent involved is not an inanimate object (such as an asteroid) or a geophysical force (such as the extreme global warming disaster of years ago) but a sentient creature: ourselves. Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success on Earth but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species. We are, as the Observer Robin McKie has put it, “ the neighbours from hell ”. The Sixth Extinction ends in a windowless room at the Institute for Conservation Research in California known as the Frozen Zoo , the world largest collection of species on ice. This, suggests Kolbert, may be the slender thread on which life on Earth will depend in future. Who knows? She underlines her final message with a quotation from the Stanford ecologist Paul R Erhlich: “IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” We have been warned.

90,"o in this series considered the possibility of humanity imminent doom from the broadest global perspective. With No the focus shifts into a narrower frame that cooler, more intimate and deeply personal. In December as an acute, lifelong reporter of her inner states, Joan Didion was presented with a unique opportunity to examine the experience of bereavement. Love and death are the themes of the great novels, but the emotion that links love and death – grief – is more often the stuff of memoir than fiction. Still, you have to be a very special kind of writer to find the detachment to examine a devastating personal loss, especially if you are going to write about it inside out. In The Year of Magical Thinking this is precisely what Didion does. Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends Joan Didion The result is a classic of mourning that also the apotheosis of baby-boomer reportage, a muted celebration of the enthralling self. “Misery memoirs” are commonplace today – Joyce Carol Oates A Widow Story is a typical example – but Didion contribution to the genre raised it to the status of literature, a point acknowledged by the playwright David Hare, who directed the author own version in a stage adaptation starring Vanessa Redgrave in Cold, clear, precise, and with her emotions mostly held in check through a web of words, Didion narrates a year that began when her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, collapsed from a fatal heart attack in the couple Upper East Side apartment on the evening of December (“Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.”) Surgical in its exquisite precision, and finally serene, Didion memoir helps to purge her grief and to set her loss in the new context of widowhood. Interpolated in the agony of this tale is the parallel drama of their daughter Quintana medical emergency, hospitalised in New York with a case of pneumonia that became septic shock. Indeed, Quintana was still unconscious in the intensive care unit of Beth Israel North hospital when her father died. During Quintana recovered, then collapsed again with bleeding in her brain. Less than two years later, she died of acute pancreatitis at the age of after a series of traumatic hospitalisations and just before the publication of The Year of Magical Thinking , Didion bestselling book to date. In Blue Nights , published six years later, Didion sets out to write Quintana elegy, but understandably and perhaps inevitably, can scarcely bring herself to face the task. Taken together, these two books, but especially Magical Thinking , consolidate Didion formidable reputation as one of the US greatest postwar exponents of first-person reportage. Louis Menand, writing in the New Yorker , captures the essence of Didion: “People liked the collection Slouching Towards Bethlehem (though it was not, at first, a big seller). People were intrigued by Play It as It Lays , Didion second novel, which came out two years later (though it got some hostile reviews). Mainly, though, everyone was fascinated by the authorial persona, the hypersensitive neurasthenic who drove a Corvette Stingray, the frail gamine with the migraine headaches and the dark glasses and the searchlight mind, the writer who seemed to know in her bones what readers were afraid to face, which is that the centre no longer holds, the falcon cannot hear the falconer, the storyline is broken.” The storyline for The Year of Magical Thinking (a title which takes its inspiration from the anthropological use of the term “magical thinking” , by which catastrophic events can be averted) is simply the rollercoaster of Didion grief in the aftermath of Dunne death. Didion reports several examples of her own “magical thinking”, particularly the way in which she cannot give away her husband shoes, because, she thought, he would need them when he returned. At first, Didion memoir refracts her pain through literature, her own and other people, but these books leave her unsatisfied. “In time of trouble,” she writes, “I had been trained since childhood, read, learn, work it up, go to the literature. Information was control. Given that grief remained the most general of afflictions its literature seemed remarkably spare. There was the journal CS Lewis kept after the death of his wife, A Grief Observed ”, but not much else. Slowly, her defences crumble on the page. “I wanted to scream,” she writes. “I wanted him back.” Then, via her own “apprehension of death” (that offstage nemesis) and her quotidian fears for her own resilience (“I began feeling fragile, unstable… What if I fell?”), she comes face to face with an abyss of grief. It one of her finest prose passages. From literary heavyweight to lifestyle brand: exploring the cult of Joan Didion “Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. We anticipate (we know) that someone close to us could die, but we do not look beyond the few days or weeks that immediately follow such an imagined death. We misconstrue the nature of even those few days or weeks. We might expect if the death is sudden to feel shock. We do not expect this shock to be obliterative, dislocating to both body and mind. We might expect that we will be prostrate, inconsolable, crazy with loss. We do not expect to be literally crazy, cool customers who believe their husband is about to return and need his shoes.” The Year of Magical Thinking is an unforgettable tour de force. Written in extremis, apparently in a white heat, from October to December it is sometimes perverse and often baffling: at once steely and precise, yet shadowy and vague, candid yet obsessively discreet. It juxtaposes a death with a marriage, reporting the one in precise detail, the other in piercing fragments that contrive to be haunting as well as sentimental. John Gregory Dunne is keenly present on every page, yet absent in character. Didion version projects honesty yet leaves many areas of legitimate curiosity (how good a marriage? How intimate? How secure?) quite blank and unsatisfied. In this way, a storyline that begins on the Upper East Side in New York City becomes universal, profound and uplifting, a mirror in which the desolate and the bereaved of all communities can find succour. Finally, Joan Didion has joined that select band of writers, led by CS Lewis, who have transformed grief into literature. A signature line “We are imperfect mortal beings, aware of that mortality even as we push it away, failed by our very complication, so wired that when we mourn our losses we also mourn, for better or for worse, ourselves.

91,"ome titles in this list are “zeitgeist books”, owing much of their success and influence to the way in which, consciously or otherwise, they channel the mood of the times. No Logo is a zeitgeist book. When it was first published in Canada and the USA, just after some well-publicised demonstrations in Seattle against the World Trade Organisation in November put “anti-globalisation” on the international media agenda, No Logo flourished a polemical subtitle (“Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies”), and was hailed as a mix of radical journalism and a call to arms. In hindsight, this response was fuelled in part by a kind of pre-millennial fervour. To Klein, anti-globalisation was a misnomer. “At the reformist end it was anti-corporate; at the radical end it was anti-capitalist. What made it unique was its insistent internationalism.” Meanwhile, No Logo became a manifesto for a critique of the way the world worked, embodied in the visionary and articulate figure of Naomi Klein who, in the words of the Observer review, “positively seethes with intelligent anger”. The secret of Klein work was the way in which she humanised her argument with fascinating reportage from her quest into Asian sweatshops, and the dark side of western capitalism in Africa. Her voice was insistent but not preachy, her analysis detailed but never obscure. She was hailed by one critic as the “young funky heiress to [Noam] Chomsky”. Which, in a sense, she was. Naomi Klein is the child of militant hippies who moved to Montreal from the US in as Vietnam war resisters. Her father had grown up in an American communist milieu, loosely connected to Hollywood. Klein own childhood was partly a protest against her family radical agenda, especially her mother feminism. She has said she spent much of her teenage years in shopping malls, obsessed with designer labels, in a rejection of her parents’ values. Klein has also said that it was “oppressive” to have, as a mother, “a very public feminist”, and she was slow to embrace the women movement. But two events, private and public, became the catalyst for her profound change of attitude. The first occurred when she was Her mother had a stroke, with some serious consequent disability, and Klein took a year off school to help the family care for her. This, she says was the sacrifice that saved her “from being such a brat”. Then, while studying at the University of Toronto in she became understandably traumatised by the slaughter of some female engineering students in a tragedy, (also known as the Montreal Massacre ) in which a student ran amok, shouting that he was “fighting feminism”. Having denounced the women in his path as “a bunch of feminists,” he shot killing Klein struck a chord with socially responsible exponents of pop culture. Radiohead declared the influence of her work This became Klein wake-up call as a Generation X intellectual in the making. With the publication of No Logo , she was hailed as a freedom fighter for a new and radical post-consumer culture. The great American feminist Gloria Steinem salute marked the passing of a torch: “Just when you thought multinationals and crazed consumerism were too big to fight, along comes Naomi Klein with facts, spirit, and news of successful fighters already out there.” What singled out No Logo was the potency of its reportage. Klein herself observed at the outset that this is “not a book of predictions, but of first-hand observation.” As such, it struck a chord with the more socially responsible exponents of popular culture. Radiohead, for example, declared the influence of Klein work particularly during the making of their fourth and fifth albums, Kid A and Amnesiac The band recommended the book to fans on their website and even flirted with calling their Kid A album No Logo . The pop cultural appeal of No Logo is not hard to discern. Underlying Klein observations was the idea that if the world is a global village, then the corporate logo (Nike, Walmart, or Starbucks) constitutes a universal language understood by – though not accessible to – everyone. She analysed the birth of a brand as a corporate means of animating the banal vulgarity of mass marketing. As she followed the progress of the logo, in four sections – “No Space”, “No Choice”, “No Jobs” and finally “No Logo” – she moved through the negative effects of brand-oriented corporate activity, before developing a central argument about the conflict between corporate dominance and personal identity and the various methods adopted by the individual consumer to fight back. Part of the attraction of No Logo is Klein frank admission of the naivety of her quest. When, in conclusion, she debates consumerism v citizenship, and chooses citzenship, she is appealingly candid. She writes: “When I started this book, I honestly didn’t know whether I was covering marginal atomised scenes of resistance or the birth of a potentially broad-based movement. But as time went on, what I clearly saw was a movement forming before my eyes.” A movement is what she still promoting. Part of the attraction of No Logo is Klein frank admission of the naivety of her quest. She is appealingly candid Ten years after the publication of No Logo , Klein, looking back, reflected on the lessons of her experience. In part, she seems to recognise that the phenomenon she had identified in is here to stay. “The first time I saw a ‘Yes We Can’ video… featuring celebrities speaking and singing over a Martin Luther King-esque Obama speech, I thought: finally, a politician with ads as cool as Nike.” Even with her subsequent disillusion – shared by many North American liberals – at Obama failure to live up to his lofty rhetoric, Klein still conceded that the world love affair with Obama rebranded America had been timely. “Obama didn’t just rebrand America,” she writes, in a telling admission, “he resuscitated the neoliberal economic project when it was at death door. No one but Obama, wrongly perceived as a new FDR, could have pulled it off.” Klein still retains her ambivalence about branding, and its broader social consequences, but she admits that “the global embrace of Obama brand” continues to demonstrate an extraordinary appetite for progressive change, the kind of social transformation Klein hankers after. So her youthful radicalism seems essentially intact, albeit with a softening at the edges. “The task ahead,” she writes, in language that betrays the influence of the phenomenon she once denounced, “is to build movements that are the real thing.” Quoting Studs Terkel , North America great radical socialist historian, she observes: “Hope has never trickled down. It has always sprung up.” As this new series develops, exploring the core of the Anglo-American tradition, we shall discover some fascinating connections between Klein and some of the radical journalists of the past, maverick polemicists such as Daniel Defoe and Tom Paine . No Logo , for all its wonky side, is at least partly descended from Paine Common Sense , and Naomi Klein would have plenty to discuss with the author of A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain . A signature line “The astronomical growth in the wealth and cultural influence of multinational corporations over the last years can arguably be traced back to a single, seemingly innocuous idea developed by management theorists in the that successful corporations must primarily produce brands as opposed to products.” Three to compare Jeff Ferrell: Tearing Down the Streets: Adventures in Urban Anarchy William Gibson: Pattern Recognition Naomi Klein: This Changes Everything – Capitalism Versus the Climate No Logo by Naomi Klein (Harper Collins, To order a copy for go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call Free UK p&amp;p over online orders only.

92,"oetry will be braided into this series like a golden thread, because in every generation it is the poets who replenish and tantalise the collective consciousness. As I’ve written already, this list is a personal inventory of some core texts, the books that I believe shaped our imagination and “made us who we are”. Birthday Letters fits that template, surviving Ted Hughes as a work of outrageous audacity, astonishing rhetorical and lyrical fervour, mixed with heartbreaking candour. In short, it is a landmark in English poetry. In any age, the story of Ted (Hughes) and Sylvia ( Plath ) would be a chapter torn from the playbook of romantic tragedy. Furthermore, in the Anglo-American literary tradition, the marriage of two great contemporary poets from opposite sides of the Atlantic must be a source of endless fascination. At first, the double helix of love and work inspired some remarkable poems, but add the early suicide of one, and the lifelong torment of the other, and you have the makings of a myth. When, in the late summer of Hughes walked into the offices of his publisher, Faber &amp; Faber, with the manuscript of poems addressed to his dead wife, he was chiselling the synopsis of a stupendous private drama high into the north face of Parnassus. Birthday Letters , the manuscript in question, published in became the most sensational new collection of poems in living memory. Hughes was tormented by the vociferous fans of Plath who wanted to hold him to account for her suicide in The collision of art and love, the tectonic plates of any writer career, creativity mingling with everyday life, must be the San Andreas fault of literature. When the two writers involved happen to be great contemporary poets, artistic equals, the material that explodes from the depths is bound to be incandescent, exhilarating, unearthly and passionate. For Hughes, addressing Plath inevitably had its mythologising dimension. He writes: The dreamer in her Had fallen in love with me and she did not know it. That moment the dreamer in me Fell in love with her and I knew it. A letter to his friend and fellow poet Seamus Heaney , describes the backstory. From the Hughes says that he began to address his “letters to Sylvia”, exploring every aspect of their relationship. At first, Hughes reports, he wrote them on the hoof, informally; later, he tried to work at them in a more controlled way but found that he was unable. He went back to spontaneous forays: some of these Birthday Letters poems first appeared in his New Selected Poems but in correspondence with friends, he would admit that he found some of the other poems in the series too personal to publish. Birthday Letters , written over a period of more than years, was Hughes own great reckoning – although it would turn out to be incomplete. When Birthday Letters finally appeared, Hughes cast his extraordinary spell, and not for the first time, over an audience which, for two generations, had been brought up on The Hawk in the Rain , Crow and The Rattle Bag , as well as on the tale of Ted and Sylvia, one of the love stories of the century. The book became an instant bestseller and prizewinner. There are many ironies in play with Birthday Letters . First, there is the unquenchable afterlife of a tragic relationship with which Hughes himself spent half a lifetime grappling. Throughout his career, Hughes was tormented by the vociferous fans of Plath who wanted to hold him to account for Plath suicide in the winter of and also for the way in which he administered the posthumous publication of her oeuvre. In death, as in life, Sylvia troubled him still. Birthday Letters became a painful, at times self-lacerating, tribute to the radioactive power of that legacy, as well as a monument that inexorably reminded readers of Hughes contemporary status. It was also a career-defining volume. Now, approaching years after his death, Hughes the poet, so often teased and parodied in his lifetime, is emerging as one of the towering literary figures of the past century, to be spoken of in the same breath as Eliot, Yeats, Auden and Larkin. As the Observer put it recently, “he has become the once and future king of the English literary imagination”. With Birthday Letters , Hughes also winds Sylvia inextricably into his own literary afterlife. Perhaps she would not have been disappointed. Plath was a mesmerising and tormented figure, who was only too willing to play her part in any drama. “She wrote her early poems very slowly,” Hughes once said of their early days together in the It was, he said, “as if she were working out a mathematical problem, chewing her lips, putting a thick dark ring of ink round each word that stirred her on the page of the thesaurus”. Ted Hughes: The Unauthorised Life review – a man smouldering with life Birthday Letters (together with Plath letters and diaries) describes a now familiar tale. If her beginnings were slow and desk-bound, Plath was soon soaring beyond her lover reach. But it was a fatal trajectory. Theirs was a tragic match and the relationship turned sour. By the instability that had dogged Plath whole life was becoming painfully dominant. The question that feminist critics have endlessly debated is: was she so obsessed with her dead father that her suicide was almost predetermined, or did Hughes behaviour, particularly his decision to leave her for another woman after six years of marriage, push her to the edge? Who will ever know? In Last Letter , a poem with the traumatic line “Your wife is dead”, released by the poet estate after his death, Hughes himself gets sucked into that vortex, declaring that the explanation for suicide is “as unknown as if it never happened”. So Plath tragic death remains a mystery that has already inspired one masterpiece ( The Savage God by Al Alvarez , the Observer former poetry editor) and numberless words of exegesis. Hughes himself went to ground, living in Devon, writing about nature and keeping his counsel. It did not do him much good. “My silence seems to confirm every accusation and fantasy,” he once wrote. With Promethean stoicism, he held his ground. “I preferred [silence], on the whole, to allowing myself to be dragged out into the bullring and teased and pricked and goaded into vomiting up every detail of my life with Sylvia.” But he was still wounded. I remember once awkwardly broaching the Sylvia question with him, after several glasses of wine, and being touched and amazed at the flood of loving recollection released by a simple – and tactless – inquiry. He was, in his prime, as compelling a figure as Plath: an unforgettable physical presence with fathomless reserves of feeling and humanity, and a gentle Yorkshire voice that seemed to remake every sentence it uttered. Carol Hughes has tried to do her best by her husband work. She always knew about the last letter, and what it revealed Birthday Letters was also an attempt by Hughes to nail shut a Pandora box of prurient, often vicious, speculation. It easy to forget the vehemence of the opposition. The poet readings were sometimes interrupted by cries of “murderer”; the American feminist poet Robin Morgan published The Arraignment which began with the lines “I accuse/Ted Hughes...” Having explored the passage of Plath short life, Hughes stopped short of revealing the circumstances of the suicide itself, about which there had been endless gossip. He had been wrestling with that lost weekend in the frozen midwinter of especially the horrifying, almost macabre, detail that Plath had reassuringly burned her suicide note, which had reached Hughes prematurely, in front of him. He distilled the horror of this moment into repeated drafts of Last Letter in a “blue school-style exercise book” that contained versions of several other poems that also appear in Birthday Letters . The only person who knew of this poem existence, because Hughes had given her a typed fair copy of it, was the poet widow, Carol. This is where a concluding and redemptive chapter in this story begins. Carol Hughes , with impressive dignity, has chosen never to speak publicly about her husband. For any literary estate, the question of what it is right to publish is always fraught. The second Mrs Hardy burned her husband correspondence with her predecessor, enraging generations of scholars. Hughes himself had been criticised for his destruction of Plath last journal. Carol Hughes, however, has always tried to do her best by her husband work. She had always known about this “last letter”, and what it revealed. Biding her time, she chose the right moment to release it, in the pages of the New Statesman . On publication, Carol Ann Duffy , the poet laureate, observed that this last poem, the coda to Birthday Letters , is “a bit like looking into the sun as it dying. It seems to touch a deeper, darker place than any poem he ever written.” Time will tell if Sylvia Plath spirit has finally been laid to rest. Birthday Letters has already become part of the canon.

93,"n the run-up to the US presidential election, that rollercoaster primary season in which Hillary Clinton was expected to play a starring, and possibly triumphant, role, I was commissioned by the Observer to review the campaign biographies of the principal Democratic and Republican contenders, a slate of candidates that ran the gamut of implausibility from John McCain and Mitt Romney to John Kerry, John Edwards and Joe Biden. Dismal as these politicians appeared to be on the campaign trail, their collected works made an even sorrier catalogue. All the books under review turned out to be either ghosted by party hacks, or “As told to”. Every last one of them was a farrago of wonkishness, insincerity, and cliche, polemical half-truths and bits of old stump speeches, mashed-up press releases and policy statements, reheated for popular consumption in some of the dullest American prose imaginable. Was it possible that none of the candidates had even read these books, let alone written them? There was, however, an exception, a shaft of clarity and brilliance in the prevailing murk. One of the Democratic outsiders, the junior senator from the state of Illinois, a certain Barack Obama , had not only written his own book some years before, he had also executed an affecting personal memoir with grace and style, narrating an enthralling story with honesty, elegance and wit, as well as an instinctive gift for storytelling. From his opening line, “A few months after my twenty-first birthday, a stranger called to give me the news…”, it was clear that Dreams from My Father was something special. It had a voice, and an unmistakable authority. Indeed, at the point at which I picked it up, Obama memoir had been published for about years, and was belatedly becoming a US bestseller on the rising tide of support for the candidate winning and optimistic “Yes We Can” campaign. Back in among many millions, I had never heard of Barack Obama, though I was vaguely aware that he had made an electrifying speech at the Democratic party convention . Now, not only did I begin to follow his campaign, I suggested in the Observer that a presidential candidate with such literary and rhetorical gifts deserved to be in the White House, and predicted that, against the odds, he might prevail. Anyway, a year later, it had all come to pass. Hillary Clinton (shades of had been passed over by the voters. “Yes We Can” had become “Yes We Did”. The story narrated in Dreams from My Father is every bit as remarkable as Obama rise to power, and displays an acute sensitivity to the persistent trauma of the American political settlement: race. This is the issue that had troubled Thomas Jefferson, as he once put it, “like a fire bell in the night”, and it becomes Obama starting point. As an African American, Obama declares an ambition to “speak in some way to the fissures of race that have characterised the American experience”. Race, for many, remains one of the most contentious issues in contemporary America. Obama presidency has been haunted by race relations. His own occasionally uncertain response demonstrates how difficult a subject it remains. Hard Choices: Hillary Clinton lays foundations for presidential run Beyond this, Dreams from My Father is a remarkably candid portrait of a young man facing up to the big questions of identity and belonging. As the son of a black African father from Kenya, and a white American mother from Wichita, Kansas, the young Obama had to make a crucial psychological odyssey, fraught with many conflicting emotions. At first, he traces the movement of his mother family from Kansas to Hawaii, and thence to Indonesia. One of the many distinctive qualities to the book is Obama natural and fearless way with dialogue. He animates countless scenes between his young self, his mother and his grandparents with scraps of well-remembered, or possibly well-imagined, conversation that give the narrative a delightful informality. As the book grows in confidence, young “Barry” finally travels to Kenya to address the painful truth of “the old man”, his father life, and become reconciled to his inheritance as an American of African heritage. Once his parents divorced, he was on his own. “In an improbably short span,” he writes, “it seems that my father fell under the same spell as my mother and her parents; and for the first six years of my life, even as that spell was broken and the worlds that they thought they’d left behind reclaimed each of them, I occupied the place where their dreams had been.” Here he movingly evokes his “troubled heart – the mixed blood, the divided soul, the ghostly image of the tragic mulatto trapped between two worlds”. It is, he repeats, an attempt at “an honest account of a particular province of my life”. As “a boy search for his father” there is inevitably less of a focus on Obama mother, Ann Dunham. Her absence is perhaps the most telling feature of Obama recollections, raising many questions about his relationship to the American component of his identity equation. Many commentators have rhapsodised over Dreams from My Father . Toni Morrison was one of the first to recognise “his ability to reflect on this extraordinary mesh of experiences that he has had, some familiar and some not, and to really meditate on that the way he does, and to set up scenes in narrative structure, dialogue, conversation – all of these things that you don’t often see, obviously, in the routine political memoir biography....” She concludes, powerfully: “It unique. It his. There are no other ones like that.” More prosaic, according to Time magazine, Dreams from My Father is “the best-written memoir ever produced by an American politician”. In the New York Times , Michiko Kakutani described the memoir as “the most evocative, lyrical and candid autobiography written by a future president”. At the end of his time in office, it certainly raises many expectations for the retired Barack Obama presidential autobiography. The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S Grant remains a hard act to follow.

94,"uriosity is one of the human animal essential qualities, and two questions – where did we come from, and how did we get here? – continue to express the insatiable curiosity that animates human consciousness. Today, when we consider our place in the universe, the cosmos remains the supreme frontier of mankind propensity to wonder at its origins. Last month, an event in a remote corner of our universe, another contemporary reminder of this timeless curiosity, hit the international headlines with the dramatic verification of a concept first predicted by Einstein in gravitational waves. In the words of the New York Times , “a minuscule jiggle, discovered in an exotic physics experiment” saw two teams of American scientists, in collaboration with British and German partners, overcome almost insurmountable odds “to open a vast new window on the cosmos”. This, in simple language, was the wider significance of the moment – an astronomical “first” – when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) announced that a signal from gravitational waves had been discovered emanating from the collision and merger of two massive black holes (collapsed stars) more than a billion light years away. The mind-dizzying scale of this data only begins to come into focus when you remember that just one light year is approximately trillion miles. Welcome to Stephen Hawking and his universe. He devoted the final chapters to 'wormholes', piral galaxies' and, perhaps most controversial, uperstring theory' It was, rather less distantly, in that Hawking confirmed his place as the most brilliant British scientist of his generation with the publication of A Brief History of Time , a succinct, entertaining and brilliantly lucid account of our relationship with the universe. In addition to his review of all the great theories of the cosmos, from Galileo and Newton to Einstein, Hawking, who was already renowned for his work on black holes, took the opportunity to explore and publicise some of the most speculative contemporary ideas about space and time. He devoted the final chapters of A Brief History to “wormholes”, “spiral galaxies” and, perhaps most controversial of all, “superstring theory”, in a complex narrative that was also a sketch for Hawking goal of a “complete, consistent and unified” theory of physics. It was his ambition, he wrote, to facilitate “the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason – for then we would know the mind of God.” What, you might ask, is the use of such hyperbole? What, indeed, is the justification for a highly theoretical department of science, such as astrophysics, that doesn’t contribute to the improvement of the physical world (safer aeroplanes; faster cars; better washing machines)? Here we have to acknowledge the immense but intangible cultural significance of scientific inquiry, especially its ability to change mankind perspective of its place in the universe. Stephen Hawking at still the brightest star in the scientific universe Who knows what the Ligo experiment or A Brief History will achieve? If history is any guide, however, the impact on our consciousness is potentially profound. Already, as my Observer colleague Robin McKie recently reported : “It is now clear that astronomers have created a new type of astronomy: gravitational wave observation.” The Ligo breakthrough joins an extraordinary tradition of scientific endeavour. As one of the scientists behind Ligo put it, “This confirms the existence of a range of intermediate black holes, about which we had theoretical doubts. Now those have gone. We’re already going places.” Over the centuries, Aristotle, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Einstein and many others, often at great personal cost, have changed our understanding of the universe. Hawking own boastful calculations of his book sales suggest that A Brief History will have influenced the minds of a generation as few other contemporary titles will have done. Translated into languages, as he writes in the introduction to the latest paperback edition, A Brief History has sold “about one copy for every man, woman and child in the world”. Not bad for a book that, Hawking freely admits, he never expected “to do anything like as well as it did”. From its opening page, in which he repeats the apocryphal tale of the little old lady who told Bertrand Russell that “the world is really a flat place supported on the back of a giant tortoise”, Hawking intention is to instruct and entertain. He recounts, tongue in cheek, that when Russell is said to have replied, with a smirk, “What is the tortoise standing on?”, the old lady answered, “You’re very clever, young man, very clever. But it turtles all the way down.” Plainly, Hawking can appreciate the ironies implicit in the speculative side of quantum physics. We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God In fact, what follows is not fanciful but hard-nosed, an authoritative account, addressed to the layman, of Hawking understanding of space and time, the expanding universe, particle physics and the origins of the universe. Nearly years from publication, Hawking has refined some of his ideas. In he seems to have been tempted by quasi-spiritual distractions. In he spoke out unequivocally in favour of an aetheistical understanding of man origins : “We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.” Hawking own life and his heroic struggle with the debilitating effects of motor neurone disease have become braided into the world response to A Brief History and many of his subsequent speculations, as if his suffering has somehow sharpened his perception of the cosmos and its mysteries. For the media, the oracular nature of his utterances, and the remarkable courage with which he has defied all predictions of his imminent mortality, have imbued some of his theories with a quasi-mystical status. The most cursory reading of A Brief History of Time will remind his readers that there is nothing fuzzy or untested about the intelligence behind this contemporary classic.

95,"ewspapers and magazines often provide an indispensable patronage for writers. The Right Stuff is one of several great books in this list that derive from the interaction of high journalism and a higher literary ambition. In Rolling Stone commissioned its star reporter to cover the launch of Nasa final Apollo moonshot , one of many moments that marked the end of the Tom Wolfe responded with what he later described as just “some ordinary curiosity”. What was it, he wondered, that would make a man “willing to sit up on top of an enormous Roman candle, such as a Redstone, Atlas, Titan or Saturn rocket, and wait for someone to light the fuse?” Wolfe decided, he says rather disingenuously, “on the simplest approach possible. I would ask a few astronauts and find out. So I asked a few in December of when they gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch the last mission to the moon, Apollo The upshot was a four-part piece entitled “Post-Orbital Remorse”, which appeared in Rolling Stone during There was, however, an afterlife to Wolfe “ordinary curiosity”. He had stumbled on a “psychological mystery” – the motivation of the men involved, and his fascination with his own response. “I discovered quickly enough,” he wrote later, “that none of them, no matter how talkative otherwise, was about to answer the question, or even linger for more than a few seconds on the subject at the heart of it, which is to say, courage.” The astronauts tended to be oldest sons, named after their fathers, raised in small towns... In other words, like him And so, with his unfailing instinct for a good story, Wolfe spent the rest of the in “a rich and fabulous terrain that, in a literary sense, had remained as dark as the far side of the moon for more than half a century: military flying and the modern American officer corps”. Wolfe account of “one of the most extraordinary and most secret dramas of the century”, became The Right Stuff , his best book in any genre. A classic of reportage, The Right Stuff is both a showcase of Wolfe remarkable gifts, as well as a book of its time. Below the waterline, it was also, as Michael Lewis has identified in a brilliant Vanity Fair profile , all about Wolfe. Lewis notes that: “Wolfe took an interest in the moon landing, but less in the mission than in the men. The early astronauts had some traits in common, he noticed. They tended to be born oldest sons, in the named after their fathers, and raised in small towns, in intact Anglo-Saxon Protestant families. More than half of them had ‘Jr’ after their names. In other words, they were just like him. What was it about this upbringing, he wondered, that produced these men? It was another way of asking: What strange sociological process explains me?” Tim Adams interviews Tom Wolfe And because, in addition to “courage”, “test pilots” etc, The Right Stuff is all about Wolfe, it exhibits its author lifelong – and, let face it, southern – quarrel with the New York literary establishment. The Thomas Wolfe Jr, born in who had grown up in Richmond, Virginia, during the second world war, revered those “adventurous young men who sought glory in war” and who had become fighter pilots. As a young reporter in Manhattan, he found himself an outsider. Towards the record of these pilots’ self-sacrifice and heroism, “the drama and psychology of flying high-performance aircraft in battle”, Wolfe observes, with some dismay, “the literary world remained oblivious”. On my reading, The Right Stuff becomes a triple whammy and Wolfe home run. It both an exploration of courage and a meditation on its author background, as well as being a coded rebuke to the Manhattan literati who, in their devotion to the values of the New Yorker (Wolfe bete noir) and also Partisan Review , perceived military men as “brutes and philistines”. Meanwhile, the Vietnam war was in full, horrendous progress and navy pilots were dying. It was this heroism that Wolfe wanted to salute. “ The Right Stuff ,” he wrote later, “became the story of why men were willing – willing? – delighted! – to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterised as the age of the anti-hero.” The unintended consequence of writing about laconic, iron-jawed heroes was that Wolfe repressed his most rococo stylistic flourishes. Gone (mostly) were Wolfe whirlwind literary arpeggios; gone was the extravagant interior monologue of, for example, his essay Radical Chic , with famous passages such as: “ Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm . These are nice. Little Roquefort cheese morsels rolled in crushed nuts. Very tasty. Very subtle. It the way the dry sackiness of the nuts tiptoes up against the dour savour of the cheese that is so nice, so subtle. Wonder what the Black Panthers eat here on the hors d’oeuvre trail? Do the Panthers like little Roquefort cheese morsels wrapped in crushed nuts this way, and asparagus tips in mayonnaise dabs, and meatballs petites au Coq Hardi , all of which are at this very moment being offered to them on gadrooned silver platters by maids in black uniforms with hand-ironed white aprons…” More sober, more subtle, and more respectful, in The Right Stuff Wolfe dedicates himself to probing the hearts and minds of the first Americans in space – Yeager, Conrad, Grissom, Glenn – those heroes who rocketed heavenwards to take on the Russians in the deep blue night of weightlessness, to pioneer another new frontier, and to thrill the American people. Wolfe, meanwhile, remained a child of his times. He could never give up his dream of writing A Novel. “It hard to explain,” he writes in The New Journalism , “what an American dream the idea of writing a novel was in the the and right into the early The Novel was no mere literary form. It was a psychological phenomenon. It was a cortical fever. It belonged in the glossary... somewhere between Narcissism and Obsessional Neuroses.” After The Right Stuff made him a heap of money, a fully self-sufficient Tom Wolfe was going to scale the north face of Parnassus if it killed him. And when Rolling Stone (which commissioned him as if he were Dickens) came calling again, we got... The Bonfire of the Vanities . But that a whole other story. A signature sentence “When the final news came, there would be a ring at the door – a wife in this situation finds herself staring at the front door as if she no longer owns it or controls it – and outside the door would be a man... come to inform her that unfortunately something has happened out there, and her husband body now lies incinerated in the swamps or the pines or the palmetto grass, “burned beyond recognition”, which anyone who has been around an air base for very long realised was an artful euphemism to describe a human body that now looked like an enormous fowl that has burned up in a stove, burned a blackish brown all over, greasy and blistered, fried, in a word, with not only the entire face and all the hair and the ears burned off, not to mention all the clothing, but also the hands and feet, with what remains of the arms and legs bent at the knees and elbows and burned into absolutely rigid angles, burned a greasy blackish brown like the bursting body itself, so that this husband, father, officer, gentleman, this ornamentum of some mother eye, His Majesty the Baby of just years back, has been reduced to a charred hulk with wings and shanks sticking out of it.” Three to Compare Norman Mailer: Of a Fire on the Moon Carl Sagan: Cosmos: A Personal Voyage Tom Wolfe: The Bonfire of the Vanities",1314,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/14/100-best-nonfiction-no-7-right-stuff-tom-wolfe
96,"ext to the suicide bombings, the air strikes, and the beheadings, a closely argued monograph devoted to a radical post-colonial thesis might seem to suggest a modest literary intervention. Yet in the ongoing, brutal clash of Islam and the west, Edward Said analysis remains the book to which no combatant can be indifferent. Orientalism is a profoundly influential and controversial study of the way in which, for at least years, ever since the wars between the ancient Greeks and the Persians, the west has fought with, and largely dominated, the east through a persuasive colonial version of its culture and politics. Said masterpiece has been topical ever since its publication shortly before the Iranian revolution . Today, in an even more unstable world, it must be ranked high on any list of key texts related to the contemporary sociopolitical crises of the century. Said , a highly sophisticated and brilliant public intellectual, drew on his experience as an Arab-Palestinian living in the west to examine the way in which, from cu lture to religion, the west imperialised the ancient and complex societies of north Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. He would argue that the Gulf wars, and the catastrophe of Iraq , are a direct consequence of a fateful and crude ideology rooted deeply in the western mind. He would argue that the Gulf wars, and Iraq, are a direct consequence of a crude ideology rooted deeply in the west Any summary of Said immensely subtle analysis of western attitudes and conduct towards the east risks becoming a travesty. However, in simplified terms, Orientalism examines the history of how the west, especially the empires of Britain and France, created a thought process to deal with the “otherness” of eastern society, customs and beliefs. As Said himself puts it, “I study orientalism as a dynamic exchange between individual authors and the large political concerns shaped by the three great empires (British, French, American), in whose intellectual and imaginative territory the writing was produced.” The authors in question include Homer and the Greek playwrights such as Aeschylus who first characterised the Persians of “the east” in their dramas as exotic and inscrutable, stereotypes that Said shows subsequently to permeate the works of writers such as Flaubert, the young Disraeli , and Kipling, whose accounts of “the east” fed the west fascination with the orient. Said further sharpened the political edge of this narrative by showing how such ideas could be seen as a direct reflection of European racism and imperialism. After the publication of Orientalism set off a firestorm of criticism from every angle of the east-west divide, Said declared, in a retrospective essay, that “the orient-versus-occident opposition was both misleading and highly undesirable; the less it was given credit for actually describing anything more than a fascinating history of interpretations and contesting interests, the better”. Edward Said: Myth and misinterpretation of 'the orient' These were vain hopes. In the nearly years since Orientalism first appeared, the Middle East, the Arabs and Islam have continued to fuel enormous change, struggle, controversy and, most recently, warfare. Said, a pugnacious advocate for an independent state of Palestine became drawn into some visceral arguments in a way that helped politicise a book whose scholarly first intent had been to use, in Said words, a “humanistic critique to introduce a longer sequence of thought and analysis to replace the short bursts of thought-stopping fury that so imprison us”. Said always longed for elegance and sophistication in argument. “I have called what I try to do ‘humanism’,” he wrote, a word that might surprise those who found him consistently combative and unforgiving in argument. But he was unrepentant. “By humanism I mean first of all attempting to dissolve Blake mind-forged manacles so as to be able to use one mind historically and rationally for the purposes of reflective understanding and genuine disclosure. Moreover, humanism is sustained by a sense of community with other interpreters and other societies and periods: strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an isolated humanist.” Perhaps it was Said tragedy that he should practise his craft as a great literary critic in an age which has had no patience with the subtleties of language, and no serious appetite for the nuances of a complicated idea. During Said professional life, almost every aspect of his study became reduced to slogans and violent posturing. Christopher Hitchens: My friend Edward Said Indeed, just before Said died in he noted with dismay the continuing impact of “orientalist” ideology on the west: “Bookstores in the US,” he wrote, “are filled with shabby screeds bearing screaming headlines about Islam and terror, Islam exposed, the Arab threat and the Muslim menace, all of them written by political polemicists pretending to knowledge imparted by experts who have supposedly penetrated to the heart of these strange oriental people...” As the US and the western powers continue to grapple with the crisis of Islam in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Libya, while desperately appeasing the oil-rich princes of Arabia, Orientalism will remain the text to which the Foreign Office and the State Department will have to return to replenish their search for mutual understanding in the conflict between east and west. Said was a vociferous enemy of theories about the “clash of civilisations”... he argued for intellectual progress Said was always a vociferous enemy of theories about the “clash of civilisations”. With great elegance and clarity, he argued for intellectual progress. “One of the great advances,” he wrote as the Orientalism controversy raged around him, “is the realisation that cultures are hybrid and heterogeneous, and that cultures and civilisations are so interrelated and interdependent as to beggar any simply delineated description of their individuality.” How, he went on, “can one speak of ‘western civilisation’ except as an ideological fiction that gave the western nations their present mixed identities? This is especially true of the United States, which today can only be described as an enormous palimpsest of different races and cultures sharing a problematic history of conquests, exterminations, and of course major cultural and political achievements.” In words that might provide an epigraph to this series, Italo Calvino once said that a classic is a book that has “never finished what it wants to say”. Orientalism is such a book. A Signature Sentence “No former ‘oriental’ will be comforted by the thought that having been an oriental himself he is likely – too likely – to study new ‘orientals’ – or ‘occidentals’ of his own making.

97,"espite every other kind of progress, humanity still lives and dies in conditions of either war or peace, a truth reflected in our literature. There is still a place for a great war book such as Dispatches . Like its precursors, from Homer to Hemingway , whose company it keeps, Dispatches seems to begin mid-sentence, plunging its readers into the war zone before they can take up defensive positions: There was a map of Vietnam on the wall of my apartment in Saigon and some nights, coming back late to the city, I’d lie out on my bed and look at it, too tired to do anything more than just get my boots off. That map was a marvel, especially now that it wasn’t real any more. As visitors to a place that could not be mapped (“for years now there had been no country here but the war”), Michael Herr readers must quickly acclimatise to the sur-real experience of Vietnam in as though they have no choice: there a war on. Herr catches the humour, madness and drugs and sets it down with a rare combination of precision and compassion Combined with the compelling urgency of Herr narration – every line set down as if it about to be interrupted by incoming shell-fire – there Herr mesmerising voice itself, perhaps the single greatest achievement of a book that, nearly years on, offers the definitive account of war in our time, especially the Vietnam war – among the most terrible of the postwar wars.

Bomb ’em and feed ’em, bomb ’em and feed ’em.’ As well as the relentless jeopardy and the unforgettable voice in Dispatches , there also Michael Herr profound sympathy for, and grasp of, the psychology of men in combat. Thanks to his reckless immersion in the war at one of its craziest moments – working as a magazine journalist during the Tet offensive of and its aftermath – he catches the mix of humour, madness and drugs, setting it all down on the page with a rare combination of precision and compassion so that, as the reader, you think: I was there. Finally, as if all this were not enough, Herr in Vietnam (sadly, never since) is an excellent writer: In Saigon I always went to sleep stoned so I always lost my dreams, probably just as well, sock in deep and dim under that information and get whatever rest you could, wake up tapped of all images but the one remembered from the day before, with only the taste of a bad dream in your mouth like you’d been chewing on a roll of dirty old pennies in your sleep. Some of Herr best and most quotable passages read like hallucinations, and some simply are just that: descriptions of being stoned on the front line, like a character in Apocalypse Now , a film classic whose script Herr also contributed to: Just lying there tracking the rotations of the ceiling fan, reaching for the fat roach that sat on my Zippo in a yellow disc of grass tar. There were mornings when I’d do it before my feet even hit the floor. Dear Mom, stoned again. In the Highlands, where the Montagnards would trade you a pound of legendary grass for a carton of Salems, I got stoned with some infantry from the Herr can be funny, too. Describing the US mission, he writes that “At the bottom was the shit-faced grunt, at the top of a Command trinity: a blue-eyed, hero-faced general, a geriatrics-emergency ambassador and a hale, heartless CIA performer”. Namechecking an in-country spook, Robert “Blowtorch” Kromer, Herr drily adds that “if William Blake had ‘reported’ to him that he’d seen angels in the trees, Kromer would have tried to talk him out of it. Failing there, he’d have ordered defoliation”. Dispatches is not just painfully vivid, it knows that it part of the historical record, and is grounded in history, even if no one can be sure precisely where to locate the origins of the Indochina tragedy. Herr again: “Mission intellectuals like as the reference date; if you saw as far back as War and the Japanese occupations you were practically a historical visionary.” For the US, it mainly started in or after the Tonkin resolution; for Herr it started in when he became Esquire war correspondent based in Saigon. “Sitting in Saigon,” he writes, “was like sitting inside the folded petals of a poisonous flower, the poison history, fucked in its root no matter how far back you wanted to run your trace.” Herr stuck it out in Vietnam till then came back to New York with a heap of notes and a bat cave of toxic memories And Saigon was “beyond berserk”: … young Americans in from the boonies on TDY [temporary duty], charged with hatred and grounded in fear of the Vietnamese; thousands of Americans sitting in their offices crying in bored chorus, ‘You can’t get these people to do a fucking thing, you can’t get these people to do a fucking thing…’ Herr hooked up with an English war photographer, Tim Page, and Errol Flynn son, Sean, who would later go missing on assignment, and went chopper-hopping round the war zone, taking huge risks, getting stranded in Khe Sanh in the winter of during its infamous siege (a brilliant set piece at the heart of Dispatches ), surviving against the odds. Herr stuck it out till then came back to New York City with a heap of notes, a file of Esquire pieces, and a bat cave of toxic memories. Within months of coming home, he was in the midst of a near-disabling depression, and perhaps the writing of Dispatches became part of his route out of hell. The upshot was a book, published in which every journalist and writer – from John le Carré to Robert Stone – who had ever been in a war zone wished they’d written. Comparisons were made with books like The Red Badge of Courage and All Quiet on the Western Front , but this was different: it was by a writer not a soldier, and it was the writer sensibility that made his book captivate a whole generation of readers. Another celebrated New Journalist, Hunter S Thompson, spoke for the profession when he said: “We have all spent years trying to explain what happened to our heads and our lives in the decade we finally survived – but Michael Herr Dispatches puts the rest of us in the shade.” Here in the UK, where Herr lived for a while during the British war correspondents such as my Observer colleague Ed Vulliamy would make a point of getting an introduction: “Every writer who has tried his or her hand at war journalism,” wrote Vulliamy , “would go to meet Michael Herr rather like a student of the cello would approach Mstislav Rostropovich. Apart from learning by listening, the gratifying thing is to find that one own follies and fears are echoes of Herr; one almost feels validated in one quirks of judgment in the aftermath of war.” Now in a new century, and a new geopolitical landscape, it as though everything, and nothing, has changed. As Herr writes, in another of his most haunting passages, the US army “took space back quickly, expensively, with total panic and close to maximum brutality. Our machine was devastating. And versatile. It could do everything but stop.” A signature sentence “I went through that thing a number of times and only got a fast return on my fear once, a too classic hot landing with the heat coming from the trees about yards away, sweeping machine-gun fire that sent men head down into swampy water, running on their hands and knees towards the grass where it wasn’t blown flat by the rotor blades, not much to be running for but better than nothing.” Three to compare Joseph Heller: David Halberstam: The Best and the Brightest Neil Sheehan: A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam Dispatches by Michael Herr is available in paperback from Picador Click here to order a copy for",1490,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/28/100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time-no-9-dispatches-michael-herr-vietnam-war-apocalypse-now
98,"hat is man, and what are we for? Remarkably, it was not until Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in that anyone, in our history, had thought methodically to address the reason for our existence. Darwin answer to this simple question was to show that every earthly species – chimps or humans, lizards or fungus – had evolved over about years by the process known as natural selection. But then, after the furious controversy surrounding that publication, Darwin celebrated theory fell into neglect and misuse. A hundred years later, in the heady, innovative atmosphere of the a new generation of young and ambitious evolutionary biologists found themselves confronted with a rare opportunity: the rediscovery and renewal of evolutionary theory. Enter Richard Dawkins, a young Oxford zoologist who had been born, and partly raised, in Africa. Following some notable pioneers such as WD Hamilton and GC Williams, Dawkins pulled together many disparate strands of thought about the nature of natural selection, and organised them into a conceptual framework with far-reaching implications for our understanding of Darwin ideas. He called it The Selfish Gene , a title he later considered to contain an unconscious echo of Oscar Wilde The Selfish Giant . Dawkins was convinced that an amplified and developed version of neo-Darwinism “could make everything about life fall into place, in the heart as well as in the brain”. His book would extol, he wrote, a “gene-eye view of evolution”. It was Dawkins simple, but profound, proposition that “the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even, strictly, the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity.” He acknowledged that this might sound “at first like an extreme view” but proceeded to explore all the major themes of social theory in the light of this idea, conducting his survey in a highly readable and entertaining way. With chapters such as “Genesmanship”, “Battle of the Sexes”, and “Nice Guys Finish First”, he tackled concepts of altruism and selfishness, the evolution of aggressive behaviour, kinship theory, sex ratio theory, reciprocal altruism, deceit, and the natural selection of sex differences. In hindsight, it seems appropriate that The Selfish Gene should have been published soon after The Joy of Sex and The Female Eunuch . You can call me a big bad wolf but not a bore, says Richard Dawkins From his first page, Dawkins unfolds an exhilarating and combative narrative of the gene-eye view of life with infectious brio. The Selfish Gene , he declares, should be read “almost as though it were science fiction. It is designed to appeal to the imagination.” Part of the book compulsion derives from Dawkins appealing certainty that he is exploring a scientific world in which “we are survival machines – robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes”. This insight, he reports, is “a truth which still fills me with astonishment”. Much of this book appeal lies in its author barely suppressed excitement, prose that bubbles over with the intoxication of a brilliant new approach. He buttonholes his readers; he dazzles with paradox and provocation. In an introduction to a later edition of The Selfish Gene , Dawkins describes its gestation: it was a book written in extremis (the power cuts and industrial strife of the early and, as he says, “in a fever of excitement”. For the young author, it was, in hindsight, “one of those mysterious periods in which new ideas are hovering in the air”. So zeitgeisty was it that, from first publication, the reception of The Selfish Gene was highly favourable. Initially, it was not seen as a controversial book, Dawkins wrote later. “Its reputation for contentiousness took years to grow.” Eventually it would become regarded as a work of extreme radicalism. But, he goes on, “over the very same years as the book reputation for extremism has escalated, its actual content has seemed less and less extreme”. Richard Dawkins: 'I don't think I am strident or aggressive' This is undeniable: while The Selfish Gene grew out of orthodox neo-Darwinian ideas, it actually expressed Darwinism in a way that Darwin himself might have welcomed. Rather than focus on the individual organism, it looked at nature from the perspective of the gene. It was, claimed Dawkins, “a different way of seeing, not a different theory”. It also addressed itself to “three imaginary readers”: the generalist, the expert and the student. This was a high-low cohort that swiftly propelled it on to bestseller lists worldwide. Moreover, in keeping with the temper of the times, The Selfish Gene announced itself, from the first, as “a book about animal behaviour”, arguing that “we, like all other animals, are (survival) machines created by our genes”. For Dawkins, “we” did not mean just people. He wanted his description to embrace all animals, plants, bacteria and viruses. “The total number of survival machines on Earth,” he wrote, “is very difficult to count.” Even the total number of species is unknown, he conceded. “Taking just insects alone, the number of individual insects may be a million million million.” Dawkins – in a style that would recur in later polemical books such as The God Delusion – was never less than comprehensive in his ambitions. Here, he used “survival machine” rather than “animal” because he wanted to encompass all plants and humans, too. His argument should apply, he said, to any and all “evolved beings”. Orthodox neo-Darwinian he might be, but in chapter he coined an idea about cultural transmission that quickly went viral within the global intellectual community: the meme, or replicator, a unit of imitation. Examples of memes include tunes, idea, catchphrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches: “Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation.” Shortly after this analysis, Dawkins characterised “God” as a meme. Thus, pages of The Selfish Gene might be said to encapsulate most of Richard Dawkins brilliant career, in which the theory of evolution came to offer such a satisfying and complete explanation for the complexity of life on Earth that there could no longer be a place for the possibility of God design.

99,"longside his friend Ted Hughes ( No in this series), Seamus Heaney was among the finest century poets writing in the English language. Heaney greatness was cultural as well as lyrical: he saw it as his inescapable duty to attempt a mood of reconciliation among his community. His work, rooted in his native Ireland, always had to navigate the murderous vicissitudes of the Troubles, the civil war that traumatised Northern Ireland for terrible years, from the civil rights march of October to the Good Friday agreement of April To be a writer, especially a famous poet, in this war zone was to confront a challenge that was political, artistic and tribal. Both Heaney parents came from Roman Catholic families in Protestant Ulster. Throughout his life, his origins placed him at the lethal crossroads of sectarian conflict and Irish nationalism. That was an unenviable and dangerous location at the best of times, and he learned to become highly attuned to the history and heritage of oppression. He always contrived to move, as he put it, “like a double agent among the big concepts”. Whatever his deepest feelings, Heaney is never strident. Throughout this volume there a steady undertow of irony Heaney North , published during one of the darkest times in a vicious war, reflects this instinctive ambivalence while being, at the same time, one of his most passionate collections, acknowledging both his roots and his loyalties. Crucially, whatever his deepest feelings, Heaney is never strident. Throu ghout this volume there a steady undertow of irony. For the poet, that is fundamental to Ulster life. When I interviewed him in Dublin for the Observer in , he spoke about the “articulate mockery” deployed by all the combatants in the Troubles. “The irony is so important,” he said. “In the north, northern irony has allowed people to stand at the edge of the rift and shout across to each other.” Mixed with the politics, there are also some wonderfully tender passages, notably the tender dedication to his aunt Mary: Now she dusts the board with a goose wing, now sits, broad-lapped, with whitened nails and measling shins: here is a space again, the scone rising to the tick of two clocks. And here is love like a tinsmith scoop sunk past its gleam in the meal bin. Seamus Heaney talks to his fellow Irish poet Dennis O'Driscoll Rereading North , more than years on, in the century, it surprising to discover how raw and unguarded some of its emotions turn out to be. In North , an early collection, Heaney is not as diplomatic as he would later become, especially after winning the Nobel prize in In Whatever You Say, Say Nothing, he notes with dread the fearsome “eructation of Orange drums”, and describes the “crater of fresh clay” left by a roadside bomb, and the “machine-gun posts” set up by the British army. This, he says, is “our little destiny”. Heaney own destiny was to steer a middle path. “I am,” he wrote in Exposure, the concluding poem in North , “neither internee nor informer.” He would remain an “inner émigré” for the rest of his life, steadily articulating a vision of Ireland that, finally, coheres into a most resonant and seductive myth. He never denied the tragedies and violence that blighted the lives of an Irish generation, but he linked the darkness of his own times to memories of English and Scandinavian invasions from the past, as if to suggest that lives conducted in extremis, on the edge, have more to teach than visions of the pastoral. Indeed, Heaney finds a kind of consolation in the savagery of the past, and locates this in the narrative of PV Glob The Bog People , published by his Faber editor, Charles Monteith. This popular but scholarly account of the discovery of Tollund Man , and many related victims of prehistoric rituals and forgotten atrocities, was notable for its graphic black-and-white photographs of bodies that had become perfectly preserved in the peat bogs of Denmark. Glob Bog People directly inspired four poems: Bog Queen, The Grauballe Man, Punishment, and Strange Fruit, as well as references to primitive violence in Funeral Rites and North, the title poem. These follow Tollund Man, which had appeared in Wintering Out In North , these horrific images have begun to acquire a much deeper meaning for the poet, supplying what he identified as “symbols adequate to our predicament”. He linked the darkness of his own times to memories of English and Scandinavian invasions from the past Critics will doubtless continue to argue about the focus and subject of that “predicament”. Was it addressed to “the north” as a whole, or just the Roman Catholics of Heaney province? The poet himself never wanted to be drawn into that argument. Now that he is dead, too young at , the question is academic. Besides, shading into art, North transcends politics. Some readers will prefer his first collection, Death of a Naturalist , but for me it the brilliant reconciliation of art with politics that sets North apart from the rest of Heaney oeuvre and gives it a kind of dark majesty. In Death of a Naturalist , he found his voice; in North he put that voice to the service of his people. He told me: “Your language has a lot to do with your confidence, your sense of place and authority” and added that speaking his own language, Irish English, was to acquire a trust in the pronunciation and in the quirks of vocabulary, and “to go through a kind of political reawakening”.

The judges said it was “one of the stories the rest of the media were scrambling to catch up with. It was unearthed from a quagmire of confidentiality.” Ingle joined Taylor as a double winner, being also named the specialist correspondent of the year, with the judges saying he “captured huge moments and took the reader there with descriptive, emotional writing”, adding: “The writer knowledge and understanding of athletics shone through.” Donald McRae took the sports feature writer of the year accolade. “As a profile writer he is without peer,” the judges said. His work shows “a rare sensitivity as well as writing style across areas as diverse as MMA, being gay in sport and mental health issues”. He is “an incredibly warm and empathetic interviewer who writes with verve and bite”. The Guardian won the sports newspaper of the year award and was also named the best website of the year.

1,"Sam Simmonds faces an uphill battle to feature at the Rugby World Cup next year after being ruled out for between six and nine months with a major knee ligament injury. Northampton Twickenham tribute to Rob Horne after horror injury The Exeter back-row ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament against Worcester last weekend and will be unavailable for England autumn and Six Nations campaigns. Simmonds was not included in the most recent England training squad but he has been in excellent early season form for the Chiefs and offered a potentially attractive option off the bench for Eddie Jones, the national head coach. Now, barring a remarkably speedy recovery, the is coming to terms with the gloomy prospect that his season might be over already after just five rounds of Premiership action. It is a significant blow for Exeter, who have frequently benefited from Simmonds acceleration and low‑slung power close to the line. “If the operation and rehab goes really well we’d like to hope we can maybe see him before the end of the season but it going to be touch and go,” the Chiefs’ director of rugby, Rob Baxter, said. “It hard to absorb because Simmo has been a key momentum gainer for us. Obviously he is upset. He was looking forward to having a big season.” The only possible upside, Baxter reckons, is that Simmonds should be back fit and raring to go in mid-summer if England pack require any reinforcements. “The other guys are going to be playing and are more likely to be picking up injuries than Sam,” Baxter said. “Two or three of them might go down yet. He may well find that, if he manages to get a big month in with us before the end of the season, he could look like the guy who is absolutely flying.” Baxter, who has lost another of his England squad forwards, Jonny Hill, for up to four months with a finger ligament injury, is also confident that Simmonds will ultimately come back stronger. “Yes he going to miss some big games now, but you’d hope those big games can get added on to the end of his career because he not taking the battering now.” Either way it is untimely news for an England coaching team still digesting the decision of Joe Marler to retire from international rugby to spend more time with his family. The Harlequins prop subsequent revelations about the mental stresses he endured in the lead‑up to England squad camps, meanwhile, have attracted some sympathy from his fellow players and coaches, with Leicester interim head coach, Geordan Murphy, and captain, Tom Youngs, both hoping Marler will be happier from his self‑imposed exile. “If he is getting anxiety then I feel sorry for him,” Youngs said. “If this means he leads a healthier life then fair play to him. That is the most important thing. There is a lot of pressure leaving your family and going away for a long time.” Joe Marler to face no punishment over England suspension comments Murphy, though, stressed that no professional player should ever step on to the field with even the vaguest premeditated desire to pick up a ban . “You would be disappointed if one of our guys were deliberately trying to receive a card,” he said. “I think if guys are serious and in contention for selection they wouldn’t pull something like that. “In my entire playing career I can only remember one comparable episode. We had a scrum-half who wanted to go back to Ireland for Christmas, we were playing against the Indian national team, the guy was sixth choice and the manager wouldn’t let him go. The guy picked up a mysterious injury, we won and he managed to get his week off for Christmas.” Meanwhile the Heineken Champions Cup final at Newcastle St James’ Park next May is on course to be a sell-out, with fewer than tickets remaining on public sale.

2,"UK Sport says hosting the football World Cup in Britain would be the “crowning achievement” of audacious new plans to hold between and major sporting events in the British Isles over the next years. The list of intended targets also includes the start of all three of cycling grand tours before the world athletics championships again by and even a big air ski and snowboarding world cup event in a major UK city. UK Sport claims the proposals could attract million spectators and bring in nearly in economic benefits – and would also show a global Britain was open for business in the post-Brexit era. There will be some eyebrows raised that England is willing to be part of a bid for the World Cup again, especially given the disastrous campaign for which cost and saw the bid knocked out in the first round of voting with a meagre two votes from Fifa executive committee. However Simon Morton, UK Sport chief operating officer, said Fifa new World Cup voting rules made it much more likely a British bid would succeed. “The biggest target on our list is the World Cup,” he said. “If we bid for that, landing that event would be the crowning achievement, almost irrespective of everything else we’ve got. “We have to recognise that the process Fifa used for was significantly better and more transparent than previous processes. You could argue [it] on its own is one of the best in world sport.” Morton also promised that the FA would take a very different approach this time after being widely criticised for courting controversial Fifa figures, such as the former Concacaf president Jack Warner, who was later banned. “The FA has expressed to us that they have a set of principles and they are approaching this in a different way than before,” added Morton, who said the FA is conducting a feasibility study and is due to report in January. “We all remember the bid so that why it really important that the FA is cautious and taking its time.” UK Sport is also hopeful that Wales bid to host the start of the Giro d’Italia in will be successful and there is optimism that Yorkshire can persuade the organisers of the Vuelta a España to come to the UK too. While the Ryder Cup, the world athletics championships and world amateur boxing championships are on UK Sport list, Morton appeared to play down the prospect of a combined British bid for the Rugby World Cupafter England hosted the edition, saying “if the sport has not delivered on its previous plans, that something we will consider.” UK Sport said it hoped that hosting big sporting events would be an important way of Britain using its “soft power” to get trade deals and show an open face to the world. “We are entering a really defining decade,” said Morton. “How the world sees us has never been more important. The events on this list have potential to attract million [people] and economic benefits of and to make people happier. We are a sport-mad nation and even in challenging times we need those really big moments for when the country can all come together. We need a global Britain.” Next year Britain will host the Netball World Cup in Liverpool, the UCI road cycling world championships, golf Solheim Cup, the men cricket World Cup and the world taekwondo championships in Manchester. But Dame Katherine Grainger, the chair of UK Sport, insisted this would be just the start. “We want to maintain our standing as a world leader in this area and our ambitious event strategy will help us do just that in the coming decades,” she added.",618,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/03/uk-sport-bid-host-2030-world-cup-ryder-cup-cycling-grand-tour-starts
3,"Andrew Strauss has stepped down as England director of cricket after three and a half years and following a spell of compassionate leave. The former England captain took a break from day-to-day duties in the summer to help care for his wife Ruth, who was diagnosed with cancer during the Ashes in December and says he is no longer able to offer full focus on the national side as he continues to support his family. Andy Flower, who has covered the role for the past four months , will continue in his interim capacity until December. A full-time appointment will be made before England West Indies tour in January before what will be an important year for England as they host both a World Cup and an Ashes series. County cricket awards: the Spin final word on the season “Next year is potentially the most important the game has had in this country, with the World Cup on home soil and a home Ashes series, and we have an incredible opportunity to do something special,” Strauss said before adding that his family situation meant he could not guarantee the commitment required. “It is vital that the director of cricket can give consistent guidance and support to England cricket through this period. “Taking time out this summer to support my wife and kids, as Ruth goes through treatment for cancer, has given me the chance to fully consider what right for England and what needed at home. The role in cricket requires total focus and commitment to deliver the best results, yet right now I need far more flexibility than could ever be possible in my position in order to support my family.” Strauss will take on a more versatile role within the England and Wales Cricket Board, initially supporting the chief executive officer Tom Harrison in the process of recruiting a full-time successor. Flower, a former head coach with England, is one candidate to take the role on a full-time basis. Also thought to be a strong candidate is Alec Stewart, who as Surrey director of cricket steered the side to victory in the County Championship as well as overseeing the progression of a series of talented cricketers such as Sam and Tom Curran, Ollie Pope and Rory Burns from county to national level. Ashley Giles – the Warwickshire sport director who has held posts as England selector, limited-overs head coach and Lancashire director of cricket – is another contender. Strauss was appointed England director of cricket following the side dismal group-stage exit at the World Cup. His first task was to sack the coach Peter Moores, appointing Trevor Bayliss as his replacement in a successful bid to focus the side more sharply on shorter formats of the game. He also eased restrictions on England players taking part in the Indian Premier League having been set a target of landing the country first major trophy. England will go into the series against Sri Lanka as the top-ranked one-day team and the limited overs captain Eoin Morgan believes Strauss decisions paved the way for the team current success. “He been at the forefront of it, he was incredibly instrumental in our forward thinking and planning to the position we are in at the moment,” said Morgan at the series launch in Colombo. “It easily brushed over but going back to the summer of the direction given by him to myself and Paul Farbrace – who was interim coach at time – and all the selectors was to build something to prepare for the World Cup. Without that direction we wouldn’t have been allowed the freedom to play in that manner, to know we could plan four years ahead. The absolute clarity and direction he wanted us to go was quite a big deal.” Joe Denly: ‘I went missing for a few years. I had to start enjoying it again’ Bayliss added: “We all understand the reasons why he had to step away, we fully understand that and appreciate the struggles his family has in front of them. He done a fantastic job. Andrew has been very helpful behind the scenes.” Not all of Strauss innovations worked, with the jury still out on the value of his North v South games, while his Super Series idea – in which points were awarded for Test, ODI and results across an international series – has quietly been shelved. He has also supported the controversial Hundred competition. A big early test of his reign was over whether to reinstate the ostracised Kevin Pietersen to the England side after the Ashes debacle. Strauss told the batsman there was no way back for him hours after he had scored an unbeaten triple century for Surrey. Last September Strauss clamped down on player behaviour after the Bristol nightclub incident involving Ben Stokes and Alex Hales, then put a curfew on the side after what he called “naive” behaviour on the Ashes tour. In April, he appointed Ed Smith as the new chairman of selectors in an attempt to revamp the process. Harrison said: “Andrew has brought enormous credibility, measured thinking, strong leadership and exceptional insight and we have been extremely fortunate to have worked so closely with him for the last three and a half years. He has improved the ways we work and set the direction for the men Test, one-day and teams.”",896,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/03/andrew-strauss-steps-down-director-england-cricket
4,"An influential Russian bureaucrat has been elected the head of the world chess governing body after a brutal election campaign that saw accusations of Kremlin meddling and vote-rigging. Arkady Dvorkovich, former Russian deputy prime minister for six years and close associate of the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, won a vote in Batumi, Georgia , after the British grandmaster Nigel Short dropped out of the race and pushed his support in the Russian favour. The win anointed FIDE first new president in more than years , after the eccentric Russian millionaire Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was ousted. He had been sanctioned by the United States for his close relations with dictators, including Syria Bashar al-Assad. Who will be king? Three-way battle for control rocks international chess Chess insiders claim the sport has been plagued by corrupt dealings that have limited its growth. Dvorkovich, in a short speech following his to victory, promised “a professional, efficient and transparent institution,” according to chess.com . He largely ran on a technocratic campaign, citing a tradition of elite chess in his family as the source of his interest in the post. But the presidency did appear a small fry ambition for a Kremlin lieutenant who had managed Russia economy and chaired the organising committee for Russia hosting of the World Cup. His opponent, acting FIDE president Georgios Makropoulos, had accused Dvorkovich of using Russia diplomatic power to mount a campaign to take control of the sport. Vladimir Putin encouraged the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a private meeting to persuade his chess officials to vote for Dvorkovich, according to a letter from the Israeli foreign minister seen by the Guardian. Other European chess officials told the Guardian about meetings with diplomatic officials to support Dvorkovich campaign. Dvorkovich had said that the lobbying efforts did not violate FIDE rules. Each country federation is given one vote in FIDE elections. Dvorkovich camp had made accusations that the current chess leadership could use its administrative resources to curry votes. The wildcard in the election was Nigel Short, a chess grandmaster who ran on an anti-corruption campaign but had riled many in the sport. Among his incendiary quotes was a remark that men were “hardwired” to play chess, as opposed to women. Nonetheless, Short had attracted significant levels of support. But in a surprise move on the final day, he withdrew from the election and threw his support behind Dvorkovich campaign. “You’re being milked by a very poor administration. It ‘Makroeconomics,’” Short said, according to Chess.com. He then dropped out of the race.",423,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/03/kremlin-lieutenant-elected-head-of-world-chess-governing-body
5,"The most valuable afternoon in the history of Nottingham racecourse suffered a farcical mishap on Wednesday which left an owner threatening to quit the sport after his horse was wrongly withdrawn from a race shortly before the start. Talking Horses: Jockeys prepare for show jumping test at Olympia Operative, from the Ed de Giles yard, was unruly in the stalls before the six-furlong sprint at and withdrawn from the field. But the racecourse PA system mistakenly announced it was the filly Magic Pulse, a chance trained by David Griffiths, which had been withdrawn. The mistake was quickly corrected in a further announcement which seemed to suggest that Magic Pulse had been restored to the field. A third announcement then confirmed that, by order of the stewards, Magic Pulse had also been removed from the race, which was won by Belated Breath from the Hughie Morrison stable. Magic Pulse was a live contender for the contest on Wednesday as she arrived in winning form, having won on her last start at Chelmsford City in August. She was drawn in stall five and was No on the racecard. Operative was drawn six stalls away in and No on the card. Craig Buckingham, the owner of Magic Pulse, was understandably upset after the incident and perplexed that it had not been possible to correct the initial identification error. “I’ve taken the day off to come and see the horse at my local track,” Buckingham told the Racing Post. “We were very excited to see her run and, due to an administrative error that for some reason can’t be corrected, my horse can’t run [through] no fault of her own. “She wasn’t even in the stalls. The starter made a mistake. Fine, we accept that, everyone makes mistakes, but someone up here should have the balls to say it a mistake. “They’ve corrected it over the PA, yet they’ve still withdrawn it. Where is the care for the owners in racing? I’m beginning to think nobody [cares] and I’ll be going home tonight and will be considering what I do with the rest of my horses. I’ve in total on the Flat and over jumps.” Buckingham string includes Shamrokh, trained by Michael Appleby and the winner of two races and in total prize money in in addition to horses trained by Griffiths, Marjorie Fife, Tony Coyle and Kevin Ryan. The initial error arose after the starter wrongly reported to the clerk of the scales that the racecard number of the horse to be withdrawn was nine, rather than This was then passed on to the racecourse announcer. An inquiry into the incident was delayed until after the last of the eight races on the card. The stewards later reported that “after due consideration” it had been decided that, while the announcement of Magic Pulse withdrawal had been made in error, it should stand. The panel heard evidence from the starter, the clerk of the scales, the announcer and the stipendiary steward. They also ordered that a report on the incident should be forwarded to the British Horseracing Authority for further consideration. Errors involved the incorrect identification of horses have occurred with some frequency in the UK over the past months. Two horses trained by Ivan Furtado ran in the wrong races at Southwell in January, while there was a similar incident at Yarmouth in July involving two horses from Philip McBride yard.",568,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/03/horse-wrongly-withdrawn-race-nottingham-racing-tips
6,"Brooks Koepka says he is “heartbroken” that one of his tee shots at the Ryder Cup resulted in a spectator losing the sight in one eye and described finding out as “one of the worst days of my life”. One of the American drives on the opening day of the tournament hit Corine Remande in the crowd , and she later said the impact caused “a fracture of the right eye-socket and an explosion of the eyeball”. Spectator loses sight in eye after being hit by Brooks Koepka shot at Ryder Cup “I was deeply hurt and saddened by the tragic accident,” he tweeted . “I have made contact with her family to offer my sincere and heartfelt sympathy.” Speaking on Wednesday at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, he added: “I hit the golf ball and it upsetting. It really is. Just because I hit a golf ball, someone lost the sight in their eye. If you break it down to the heart of it, it not a good feeling. “Yesterday was probably one of the worst days of my life. I haven’t had too many tragedies in my personal family where there been a loss or any kind of tragic accident so I’ve been lucky in that sense. “I wasn’t told until I got to the course – I’m not the biggest person on social media – so when I got here and had about seven missed calls and text messages I was like: ‘What going on? Then I was told the news and obviously I am really heartbroken. “My stomach sank. Yesterday was probably one of the hardest days trying to focus and play golf just knowing what was going to come when I was done. I spent an hour and a half of my round on the phone trying to understand what was going on because it hard to get the real story of what was going on. I didn’t know if it was fake or not and you want to find out. It sad and I really am torn up about it.” Koepka denied reports that he and Dustin Johnson had to be separated following a row at Europe victory party on Sunday night, and that the pair argument had started on the plane before the team arrived in Paris for the tournament. “This Dustin thing I don’t get,” he said. “There was no fight, there was no argument – he one of my best friends. I love the kid to death.” The reported fallout between Koepka and Johnson was not the only sign of disharmony in the US team, with Masters champion Patrick Reed blaming Jordan Spieth for the end of their successful Ryder Cup partnership and claiming it was “not smart” for captain Jim Furyk to leave him out of two sessions. The inherent dangers of watching golf “As far as camaraderie, it was fine, it was perfect,” Koepka added. “The problem is you guys [the media] try to find a reason why we lost and the simple reason is we just didn’t play good enough. “We didn’t make the putts, hit the fairways, especially me. I lost two matches and halved another one. If I won those, if Tiger [Woods] wins his; Dustin lost one with me and then I think lost in the singles. “If we play how we’re supposed to play we win, it simple as, but there nothing wrong with our team. Our team was great, Jim was great.” Koepka and Johnson were paired on day two of the Ryder Cup, but lost in the Foursomes to Europe Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson in the course of USA defeat .",610,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/03/brooks-koepka-ryder-cup-fan-lost-sight-worst-day-golf-ball-hit
7,"I’m most looking forward to ... Gary Bettman. Still part-way through his tenure as league commissioner, his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame this summer was odd. But a close second might be how things play out just down the road from the Hall. It there that John Tavares will take the ice as a Toronto Maple Leaf. The Tavares, an area native and childhood Leafs fan, is somewhat the embodiment of the current team: very nearly great, but as yet unproven. There is such potential in both Tavares and the Leafs, can they finally exceed it together? Yes? Maybe? CH The Washington Capitals’ defense of their championship. They entered so many campaigns with immense hopes of winning it all. When the pressure was on, they never even qualified for the final. Suddenly, when their chances were dismissed, they were able to bring the Cup back to the nation capital. All the integral pieces are back on the ice, but there a new coach behind the bench with Barry Trotz now on Long Island. Can Alexander Ovechkin and co repeat with new leadership? MC How things come together, if at all, for the Buffalo Sabres. After a roster overhaul, there a lot of intrigue in Buffalo. General manager Jason Botterill has tried to put his stamp on this team, one stuck in perennial rebuild mode. After finishing last place in the Atlantic Division in four of the last five seasons, it can’t get any worse ... can it? The division is top-heavy and I won’t be shocked if the Sabres sneak into the playoffs. JK One bold prediction ... The Golden Knights won’t make the playoffs. As expectations rise, so do the chances of a sophomore slump. The Knights may have a good season on balance, but now that teams are accustomed to playing this previously unknown squad, have had time to examine their strengths and faults – and as the quasi-phantom “Vegas flu” has worn off – the Knights may find it more difficult to grab wins, especially at home. Meanwhile, other teams in the West have made changes over the summer (San Jose), or welcomed back key injured players (Minnesota), that could make getting a top-eight spot all the tougher. CH Ilya Kovalchuk will prove he still one of the game elite wingers, if not close to it. Now he last played in the NHL during the campaign, one year after he helped lead the New Jersey Devils to the Stanley Cup final. After five seasons playing in the KHL over in Russia (and a long-awaited Olympic gold medal ), Kovalchuk is back. This time, he with the Los Angeles Kings, who handed him a three-year deal carrying an average value of the kind of contract that calls for plenty of scoring punch. He tallied a whooping points goals) during his last extended play in North America. In LA, he’ll be surrounded by the kind of players who could help him light up the league once again. MC Carey Price will be traded. Predictably down on their luck in a tough division, the heat surrounding GM Marc Bergevin will only ramp up as the season progresses. In an attempt to keep his job, and to prove that he can make a deal that won’t blow up in his face much later, Bergevin does just that. The return will include more than five players, including a goaltender, and a first-round pick, and there will be little doubt that the rebuild will be on in Montreal. (Spoiler: the trade will probably blow up in his face.) JK What would top the Knights’ run last season? The only thing left to happen in the NHL that could be as unexpected and wondrous as the Knights’ run (even more than a repeat one-upped by a Cup victory) – and which must occur soon, before the onset of either an apocalyptic nuclear war unleashed by Donald Trump in a final bid to win a Twitter spat with a bot disguised as Michael Avenatti, or the complete collapse of civilization from a climate change-fueled war for fresh water – is for a Canadian team to win the Cup again . Then, maybe, we can all die happy. (Unless it the Leafs.) CH The Ottawa Senators winning the Cup after a legendary amount of chaos swirled around the locker room. The involved parties have been jettisoned from the Canadian capital, but that means the Sens are now without franchise player Erik Karlsson. Also gone: Mike Hoffman, who was at the center of the locker room turmoil. His fiancée was accused in court of a targeted harassment campaign against Karlsson wife . The Sens are expected to sit at the bottom of the standings. MC The Maple Leafs winning the Stanley Cup. Because really, what else could top one of the most improbable stories in hockey history? It would be the Maple Leafs winning their first Stanley Cup in years, a task once thought impossible to pull off. For years, there been plenty of talk throughout the city about a parade to be planned, but we might not even get there: If there were ever a city that would implode out of sheer euphoria before the parade itself, it Toronto. JK Your Hart Trophy winner is... Look, if Connor McDavid keeps being Connor McDavid and the rest of the Edmonton Oilers continue being the rest of the Edmonton Oilers, who other than Connor McDavid deserves this? CH McDavid led the NHL in scoring last season with points. As scary as it sounds, he still just Now entering his fourth season, he figures to somehow raise his level of play, and if he can drag the Oilers into the playoffs, he a shoo-in for the league most prestigious award. MC Nathan MacKinnon , Colorado Avalanche. There a bit of room in the Central Division to jump up the standings a bit, but that will only happen if MacKinnon has another stellar season. Yes, he has a supporting cast, including Mikko Rantanen, but MacKinnon can stay healthy, he’ll be the only player who can come remotely close to Connor McDavid in the scoring race. And on a team that will finish higher than the Oilers in the standings, MacKinnon contributions to the Avalanche won’t go unnoticed. The last three winners have been different overall draft picks. It MacKinnon turn. JK Metropolitan Division winners Pittsburgh Penguins CH Pittsburgh Penguins MC Pittsburgh Penguins JK Atlantic Division winners Toronto Maple Leafs CH Tampa Bay Lightning MC Tampa Bay Lightning JK Central Division winners Winnipeg Jets CH Winnipeg Jets MC Winnipeg Jets JK Pacific Division winners San Jose Sharks CH San Jose Sharks MC San Jose Sharks JK Eastern Conference finals prediction Washington Capitals over Toronto Maple Leafs CH Tampa Bay Lightning over Toronto Maple Leafs MC Tampa Bay Lightning over the Pittsburgh Penguins JK Western Conference finals prediction San Jose Sharks over Winnipeg Jets CH San Jose Sharks over Winnipeg Jets MC San Jose Sharks over Winnipeg Jets JK The Stanley Cup winners will be … San Jose Sharks over the Washington Capitals, four games to three, because why not ? I feel like predicting the Sharks will win anything other than a couple early playoff rounds is to welcome ridicule, but darned if I’m not convinced by Erik Karlsson. Paired likely with Marc-Edouard Vlasic, Karlsson could be what the Sharks finally need to reach the elusive Cup. San Jose has already proven they can reach a Final they maintain deep scoring capabilities, a mostly solid first-string goalie, and enough experience (certainly with the addition of Karlsson) to make a legitimate run. But I guess that what we always say. CH With Erik Karlsson joining mainstay Brent Burns, the Sharks now boast the most impressive collection of puck-moving blueliners in the league. Add in a full season from trade deadline pickup Evander Kane, and San Jose seems destined to hoist their first-ever Cup. The Lightning are the most creative club, but the Sharks are physical and should outlast them in seven games. MC The Tampa Bay Lightning , For what feels like the past years, I picked the Capitals to finally win it all before I gave up on them ... last year. After making it to the conference finals in three of the last four seasons, I have to believe the Lightning are due, and will finally get over the hump as the Capitals did last season. From top to bottom, there just too much talent on that roster.

8,"trong-willed, opinionated, uncompromising: Max Verstappen has always insisted that, when it came to his driving, only one person knew best – Max. Even under a barrage of criticism this season Verstappen vowed he would not change his style. Mercedes team orders leave a sour taste in Sochi as Ferrari struggle again A command performance at the last round in Russia was the latest in a series of races that seemed to justify his self-belief. Yet it also suggests the emergence of a new Verstappen, one establishing the broader credentials needed to win the world championship. He goes into this weekend Japanese Grand Prix, where he has finished second for the last two years, on a roll. His race last week at Sochi, where he went from to fifth, was a tour de force . With his Red Bull at the back because of grid penalties, the Dutchman scythed through the field. He was up to by the end of lap one. By lap seven, when he passed Charles Leclerc for fifth, only the Ferraris and Mercedes remained in front. Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, likened the performance to that of a veteran. “It was one of the most outstanding first few laps I’ve seen for a long time,” he said. “I think he had some great races but this was an attacking race.” What stood out was the clinical precision with which Verstappen drove. His moves, particularly through turn – no easy place to pass – were executed decisively and cleanly. This was a world away from the clumsy, poor judgment that blighted his opening races and led to calls for him to change his approach. That had reached a nadir with the crash in practice at Monaco which cost him a place in qualifying. Afterwards Horner joined those hoping he would learn from his mistakes. Verstappen tired of talking about it; he would answer his critics on the track, he declared, and he did so in the following races. At the next round in Canada he had a superb start from third and went wheel to wheel with Valtteri Bottas through the opening corners. It could have ended messily but wise heads prevailed and Verstappen kept it clean to be rewarded with a podium finish . He was then second in France and followed it with a win in Austria . The retirement of the two Mercedes was crucial at the Red Bull Ring but Verstappen put himself in position to take advantage after an opening-lap battle with Kimi Räikkönen. It was hard racing, the pair banged wheels but both kept their heads and Verstappen came out in front. He won with a combination of honed aggression and patience. Before the race he believed he had already made his point in sticking to his guns. “I know I will always be right,” he told me . “Of course there will be difficult times and there will be more in the future but I know what I have to do in the car.” Further strong races seemed to vindicate him, including a fourth-place finish in Germany and third at Spa . Moreover he was consistently outpacing his teammate Daniel Ricciardo. Since Monaco he has out-qualified the Australian a remarkable record against a talented driver. However, it is Singapore that stands out. Verstappen race there demonstrated that, despite the protestations, something has actually changed behind the wheel. His qualifying lap was outstanding, only three-tenths of a second from Lewis Hamilton, who had put in the run of his career to take pole. Indeed Verstappen might have been closer but for a software-induced engine misfire. Starting from second he had to battle a determined Sebastian Vettel through Raffles Avenue. Verstappen fought him hard but, inches apart, finally ceded the pace into turn seven. It was a wise decision to play the percentages and fight on and proved advantageous. He stuck to the team plan and regained his place through the pit stops. Then, chasing Hamilton in the final third as they encountered traffic there was a sniff of a chance to go for the lead. He said afterwards he knew he had an opportunity but “didn’t want to take the risk”. It was the right call, he held on for second and it was probably his best race of the year, exemplified not by overconfident adventure but careful, considered and sophisticated racecraft. This is not to say he has changed his style but that he has learned to adapt and evaluate situations with greater effectiveness and act on them with a cool head. It is a trait shared by champions. Horner identified this after Russia, saying Verstappen has developed simply through growing up. “Since after the Monaco Grand Prix, if you look at his season, it has been very, very strong,” Horner said. “He driven some great races. I think he maturing.” Verstappen said before the season he was “always learning and nobody is a finished product”, an admission reiterated in Austria of his travails this year. “This has been character-building,” he said. “This was another step. Sometimes it is not enjoyable but sometimes you need it.” An ill-judged defensive block against Bottas at Monza was a reminder that he has not yet tamed his heart over his head but the indications are that, having celebrated his birthday in Russia, Verstappen is beginning to come of age.",897,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/oct/03/max-verstappen-21-f1-red-bull-russian-grand-prix
9,"ew Australians, Eddie Jones included, receive heartfelt standing ovations at Twickenham but Saturday will be different. In rugby, one man misfortune still has the power to unite the best of enemies and those attending the Premiership game between Northampton and Leicester in aid of Rob Horne will be supporting the worthiest of causes. Last April, in the corresponding fixture at Welford Road, the Wallaby centre was involved in a heavy collision in the opening seconds. Horne is determined not to “make this a sob story”, but his injury turned out to be profoundly serious. All five nerves in his right arm were detached from his spinal cord, the limb remains paralysed and he is still experiencing chronic pain. As well as ending his rugby career, his life has been turned upside down. Rugby union: talking points from the Premiership weekend action The bravery and character the has shown in adversity, however, is an inspiration to all. He and his family are back in Australia, attempting to adapt to much-changed circumstances and raise awareness of brachial plexus nerve injuries. “To live with paralysis is something that is very new,” says Horne, who has always written left-handed but played golf and tennis right-handed. “I’m still learning ways to do things. It funny how the body is. If one thing is taken away from you, you become pretty innovative. You work out other ways to achieve things.” The worst of times came when he first learned of the severity of his injuries. “There was definitely a hard moment when I came out of the initial surgery which found it [my arm] was completely gone. That was that. There hasn’t been any false hope like: ‘Jeez, this could get better.’ From day one I’ve known the outcome so I’ve had time to deal with it and come to a real understanding of what I’ve been confronted with. I hope that through my approach and through what I go on to achieve I can highlight these types of nerve injuries.” It remains Horne firm view that blaming rugby physicality for his predicament is too simplistic, given the number of non-rugby players he has met with similar injuries. “It not uncommon. It a high-impact injury – a lot of surgeons find it in people who have come off motorbikes. I’ve met an ex-serviceman who was shot through his brachial plexus and a young lady who was skiing and went off a cliff. It can happen in various ways. My injury is not something I hold against the game, it just one of those things.” Joe Marler to face no punishment over England suspension comments While understandably he has no desire to revisit the footage of that April day – “I can’t put myself through it” – he can remember every single detail. “It was my first game leading the team out. It was a special game up at Welford Road and we’d had a big week, changing a few things up. We were pretty primed for that game and I had my family in the crowd as well. “When the injury happened I was fully conscious the whole time. I’ve been told it looks like I’m trying to get up and I just can’t. Like any player, you don’t think anything that wrong. Initially, when I couldn’t move my right foot it was obviously an issue but I kicked and kicked and got that moving. I said to the medics: ‘I think I’m all good, I just think my shoulder dislocated.’” Soon enough, though, he noticed something different about the body language and demeanour of the medical staff treating him. “I was lying there thinking: ‘Why are they approaching me like this?’ That was probably the moment I thought that possibly something more serious has happened.” Horne has subsequently had an operation to try to reduce the pain, which involved transferring some nerves from his ribs to his triceps. Saturday will be emotionally bittersweet but, ultimately, walking back on to a rugby field unable to play his favourite sport is no longer his main concern. “You do face all sorts of different emotions; you get frustrated at some points and elated at other times. To be honest, though, I haven’t felt a loss. I suppose I’ve been faced with bigger challenges than that.” Tickets for “The Derby at Twickenham” in aid of Rob Horne on Saturday are available at northamptonsaints.co.uk/buytickets",734,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/02/twickenham-support-paralysed-rob-horne
10,"Athletes hoping to do a Jonathan Rea and triumph at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards, despite being unknown to much of the British public, will have to think again after changes to the venerable programme. Rea, the world superbike champion, came second last year after widespread support from his native Northern Ireland and an online campaign. As Spoty celebrates its anniversary the shortlist for the main prize is to be cut and will no longer be announced in advance. With athletes set to learn if they are nominated only during the live broadcast, even the most organised of fans will have little time to get their votes out. Changes to the shortlisting process were one of several elements announced by the BBC director of sport, Barbara Slater, as Spoty attempts to keep up with a changing TV landscape. For the first time, the overseas personality award will be open to votes from outside the UK and there will also be a new moment of the year award. The young personality prize will change ceremony and become part of the Radio Teen Awards. To be held at Birmingham capacity Genting Arena on December, Spoty looks set to spend less of the ceremony two hours on individuals and more on recapping the year in sport. “We review and we evolve the show and have done over the years‚” Slater said. “We’re constantly challenging ourselves on how to move it forward. I think we’ve had a concern about the amount of time we’ve had to tell the story of the sporting year. We’ve had some extraordinary sporting occasions and we felt we had to reduce them to seconds. I think that with the number of nominees at, say, [the ceremony] has been led more by individuals. One of the aims here has been to get that balance slightly back.” On the topic of fan campaigns, Slater said: “If you are going to put a vote out to the public, whether that Spoty or any show, you run that in the most robust way you can. It can simply be there are more fans of one sport than another or somebody plays for a club that has a big fanbase. But I think the vote on the night is something very dear to the show. It an opportunity for the British public to vote and that won’t change. [The changes are] about adding more interest and excitement on the night. I think that moment at the top of the show where a more focused shortlist is announced is going to add another high point.” Slater said no cap would be placed on the length of a shortlist. She added the shortlisting panel made up of an expert group of sporstpeople, administrators and media were sympathetic to the new changes. “We’ll be very clear we are aiming for a shorter shortlist‚” she said. “And I think the panel, in my experience, will be very supportive of that.” The award drew over half a million votes last year, with Sir Mo Farah named the winner. Spoty will look back on months that have already been successful both for Britain and the BBC, who have enjoyed excellent viewing figures.With the broadcast regulator, Ofcom, reviewing the status of sport “crown jewels”, Slater believes the BBC continued audience success – on a limited budget for rights – is a reminder of the importance of free-to-air sports. “This year has been exceptional,” she said. “But during last year, which was a quieter year, the BBC were responsible for of the televised sport in the UK and the highest percentage of viewership, which was Collectively, the free-to-air percentage of rights is but the viewership is getting up to So I think the message from those statistics is crystal clear, which is the importance of free-to-air coverage of sport.

The winner of each tie will go into the World Group Two play-offs in April. The British captain, Anne Keothavong, who played in several of the ties abroad since the last home fixture in Nottingham in said the ITF decision will give the women game a significant boost, much as the Davis Cup ties in Glasgow, Birmingham and at Queen have done for the men team. Djokovic kindness and Nadal water bottles: my life as a tennis ballboy “We are absolutely delighted at the prospect of playing at home for the first time in years,” she said. “This will give us a platform to show everyone what Fed Cup is all about and the passion the players have for the competition.

Kyle Hendricks gave up a tiebreaking single to Tony Wolters in the inning, sending the Cubs to a loss to the Colorado Rockies in a marathon wildcard game on Tuesday night. Chicago lost two home games with a chance to reach the NL Division Series. The Cubs scored a total of two runs over innings, dropping a tiebreaker to Milwaukee for the NL Central championship and then getting knocked out of the playoffs by the Rockies.

13,"ood news for sportsmen this week: they can now forget the pre‑tournament boot camps, and the on-tour karaoke. Travel agents, too, can cancel those large group tours to Gallipoli. Because the Ryder Cup gave us conclusive proof that the ultimate team-bonding tool is already here, and its name is WhatsApp. The European team app-inspired love-in has removed all doubt. Even we on the outside could practically see the heart-eyed emojis fluttering between Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood. If Theresa May really wants to rally her cabinet behind her at the Tory conference, she should surely be changing her profile pic to Justin Thomas in a Beat Europe T-shirt . Intriguingly, Rory McIlroy didn’t even have WhatsApp installed on his phone until the Monday before the tournament began. And here, I think, we can speculate on where it all went wrong for the Americans – they were probably still on Facebook Messenger. Jim Furyk attempts to motivate his men with big blue thumbs-ups were doomed from the start: no one likes getting those pop-up boxes in the corner of their browser. Just picture poor Tiger trying to Netflix and chill while Patrick Reed spammed Jordan Spieth with giant face stickers. Phil Neville keeps tabs on England Women ice-cream intake Yes, just as Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, major sporting tournaments can now be won in the text fields of a free-to-use cross-platform messaging service. Only a few weeks ago, when England advanced to the Women World Cup finals, Phil Neville revealed how his extensive use of WhatsApp had forged a special bond with his footballers . “It means that every single minute of the day I know what players are doing,” said Neville. Which strongly suggests he one of those friends who gets you to turn on location-sharing on the pretext of meeting up at a busy mall, then hopes you’ll forget to ever switch it back off. “I know every part of their lives,” said Neville, adding more specifics than perhaps he should have. “I know about their animals – if they’ve got a dog I know its name. I know about their partners, I know if they go to the cinema – if they have an ice cream I know about it.” It sounded creepy, but it seemed effective. Although you did wonder if Neville had really grasped the purpose of WhatsApp given that he had ongoing chats, one for each squad member. “It the only way we can be in constant contact,” he said, so either he doesn’t understand what a text message is or his SIM plan is data-only. In professional sports, as in life, WhatsApp really has only two purposes: logistics and “bantz”. This was perfectly illustrated by Britain male gymnasts in the buildup to the last Olympics. When their group wasn’t dominated by Game of Thrones spoilers, Kristian Thomas explained to me then, it was largely men exchanging pictures of leotards, so that no one turned up at competition wearing the wrong one. The England rugby team has two different group chats precisely so Eddie Jones doesn’t have to contend with aubergine emojis and Mean Girls memes. That sensible because, let face it, one of those forwards is going to be that guy who always asks what the meet-up time is, because he can’t be bothered to scroll up and hasn’t yet discovered the search function. Membership of a WhatsApp group can mean everything to a sportsperson now. Chris Ashton, for instance, only discovered he was back in the running for international duty when he was added to the scheduling chat for the summer training camp. Unfortunately, since he earned himself a seven-week ban in a pre-season “friendly” that sounded anything but, one can only assume that the dreaded words “Chris Ashton has been removed from the group” are now haunting his sleep. “Some lads try to get in there early to remove themselves in a nice way,” Danny Care recently told an interviewer, “other lads try to hold on”. Insert here gif of Martin Landau stepping on Cary Grant fingers, as he clings to the side of Mount Rushmore. In a world where our sporting heroes are distanced from us by ever increasing fame and fortune, it nice to imagine Roger Federer posting his videos to his Laver Cup team and getting embarrassed when he accidentally voice-calls Rafa. There is after all something universally humbling about the agonising wait while Novak is typing. Mike Tindall admitted not long ago that he was in “about WhatsApp groups because he didn’t want to look rude by leaving. But then you’ve got to feel for Tindall – his family group-chat includes his Olympian wife Zara and her right royal cousins, which brings about etiquette issues of its own. And even masters of social media wrestle with this stuff. Just after his retirement this year, Kevin Pietersen asked his Twitter followers: [sic] “Why do some people whatsapp not have blue double ticks when messages have been read?” He got the instant response: “David Warner not replying, mate?” Turns out we all have the same struggles. And that, I’d argue, is just another example of how the WhatsApp group is a powerful team-building technology. Not only is it a truly democratic space where sportspeople can engage in all the locker room chat they want, it is also where they learn to put up with the bowler who shares every aspect of her day in unnecessary detail, to tolerate the full-back who wants you to admire his latte art, and even to graciously accommodate the awkward addition whose number no one recognises. Plus, if it fails, there always the splinter group.",945,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/03/sport-whatsapp-messaging-team-bonding
14,"utumn is the time for renewal in north Devon, where Kayley Woollacott is facing up to the new jump season with a new sponsor and sense of determination to continue the work begun by her husband, Richard, whose death in January left the racing world in shock. Woollacott, who has spent the summer upgrading her old point to point yard, is gratified to find herself so well supported by owners and has high hopes for her team of horses, led by the top-class Lalor. “I think Richard would be really proud of the horse,” the says as she reflects on the emotionally charged day in April when Lalor won Aintree Top Novice Hurdle during the Grand National festival. “He’d be proud of everybody here.” Talking Horses: Gambling Commission report on betting disputes gets guarded welcome There was considerable doubt in the weeks after Richard death about what would happen to the business he had built up so painstakingly. Woollacott clearly had the necessary talent for horse management, having saddled over point to point winners from her own premises, but would she want the responsibility while raising a three-year-old girl on her own? A key moment, as she recalls it now, was Lalor defeat in the Betfair Hurdle in early February. The race had been his target for months and hopes had been high but he finished well down the field. In response, Woollacott chose to bring the racehorses over from Richard yard, three miles away, to hers. “That was really a turning point. We said, if we are going to carry on until April, we’ve got to do it properly, you can’t just half do it. It was a big help to me to have everybody in one place, move the horses away from all the …” She stops herself, seemingly on the point of saying “memories”. “It was very difficult to have to keep going over to there every day. That decision was the start of moving it forward a bit.” Crucially, Woollacott has the backing of David Staddon, owner of Lalor and other horses in the yard. “I think he came over two days after Richard died and said: ‘The horses will stay, you keep going.’ That was massive.” Other owners have been similarly supportive. Woollacott has racehorses and others for point to pointing. Her family have rallied round and the PR skills of her sister, Stephanie Jones, have now helped bring the bookmaker Betway to the yard as sponsor. It was a connection that made sense; Betway sponsors the Aintree race which made Lalor name and also the man who rode him, Richard Johnson. Their involvement will help to anchor the yard finances and comes with the added benefit of a smart new horsebox and uniforms for the staff. The sisters also spent part of their summer on a hike over Welsh mountains to raise money for the mental health charity, Mind, whose work has impressed Woollacott and offered her insights into the illness that led her husband to take his life. “We were on Crib Goch,” she says. “If I’d looked it up on the internet before going, I wouldn’t have gone. I got up there and thought: ‘God, I’m not going across here … There no way down!’ But it was something you could really take a lot of frustration and anger out on. It was good to do.” Now her focus is on Lalor, who will make his debut over fences in the Best Mate Chase at Exeter this month, provided there is sufficient rain. “I think he’ll be better over fences. It took a long time for him to ‘get’ hurdling. He seems more natural over a fence, gives him a little bit more time. He schooled really well.” Along with her daughter, Bella, it is Lalor and his stablemates who kept Woollacott going through difficult times. “I had a wobbly day last week, so I pulled all the horses out and took pictures of them for the website. And they all looked fantastic. And you look at that and think, OK, it all going the right way.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org",719,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/02/kayley-woollacott-richard-lalor-jumps-season
15,"During my three years as a ballboy at the Miami Open I learned that, like a waiter at a Michelin-starred restaurant, we should be invisible unless summoned. The players’ rage and adrenaline often smother the court, so when Fernando Verdasco snapped at a ballboy on court at the Shenzhen Open last week for being a millisecond late to deliver his towel , I was not surprised. I doubt the boy at the end of Verdasco anger was either: the job core is to tend to the players and umpire. The best ballpeople tether themselves to the wave and ride, although they still deserve respect. Naomi Osaka Adidas deal shows being a female athlete can pay It not like the job doesn’t have its perks. We got free tickets and tennis gear, but the greatest prize was the privilege of being close enough to our idols to talk to them and – if you’re into sweaty athletes – smell them too. Between and I was lucky to be on court with every player – male and female – in the world top except Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Juan Martin del Potro. Andy Murray could be grumpy but he was never abusive. Novak Djokovic and Gaël Monfils were fun and kind, but Marcos Baghdatis, who once told us jokes throughout a memorable doubles match, was my favorite. Not everyone was as easy to deal with. Andy Roddick refused to pocket a ball or move a centimeter from his path to receive one. Your toss, with one bounce, had to land on his racket. Roddick wanted his towel after every point. And he played fast, so you had to pay full attention to his body language. On days when players like Nicolás Massú and Michaël Llodra, both notorious hotheads towards the end of their careers, were slated to be on court, the program director would call a meeting and warn us that if we were cursed at we should stay silent and still. Beside discipline and fitness, the key strength for ballpeople is knowing the players’ superstitions. For example, although I was never on court with him, it was known that Nadal likes two water bottles, placed at his right foot. You were to hand them over for him to place. He always drinks the bottle on the left-hand side first, and places them delicately back in the same spot when he is finished. It been the same through his brilliant career. Upsetting his routine would likely end your chances of working in the big matches. The Miami Open made sure we were ready for the demands of the tournament. The program director boasted the Miami Open was second only to Wimbledon in the quality of its ballgirls and ballboys. Nearly candidates tried out over the course of four Sundays before the tournament. The drills could be unorthodox: one measured how long we could keep our arms straight up in the air. We had to arrive at sharp for the trials, and if you were late, you were instantly cut. During suicide sprints , the drill sergeant, an ex-military man, accused tired joggers of “hotdogging”, though no one knew what that meant. He would also make “boing boing” noises at heavier, slower runners. Once you were in, it was great. You were a fundamental part of the tournament, with the best seat in the house – as long as you didn’t mind dodging aces from Ivo Karlovic. But we were always told we weren’t the main event, the players were – and we understood they would show flashes of temper. Releasing tension is necessary in a high-pressure environment, and on each point, their earnings were on the line. The job of the ballperson is to make it as easy as possible for players and they know that. But there a balance, and sportsmanship and respect are truest virtue of the sport. Verdasco should know that most ballpeople are either volunteers or making minimum wage – they’re really there for the love of the game.",672,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/02/ballboy-tennis-fernando-verdasco-novak-djokovic
16,"nd so, with a last splendid hurrah, the doors have closed on another county season. To celebrate those fleeting months, the Spin has delved into the wardrobe and come up with some awards, though she unsure if she’ll be able to present them as she very busy in a meeting a few hundred yards away at the other side of the ground. The Stuart Surridge award for team of the season Surrey, for their unrelenting brilliance and the determination to play cricket in the right way – undefeated all summer till the death or glory battle against Essex. Also for their decision to give Alec Stewart and Gareth Townsend at the academy time to bring young players through the ranks – this year they reaped the rewards. The Mark Ramprakash award for player of the season Rory Burns, for his gallons of runs for Surrey – the leading run-scorer in either division – his outstanding leadership and his phlegmatic shrugs towards the England selectors. He did finally get his golden ticket, at the close of the season, when clamour burst through Ed Smith door and demanded his name on the teamsheet for Sri Lanka . The five county cricketers of the year The Spin-doctors award for overdoing the scarification Somerset, whose ill-judged dust-bowl for the game against Lancashire risked the ire of the pitch inspectors and nearly caused Paul Allott to combust spontaneously. The sprung-from-a-lovely-old-ground award The Worcestershire trio of talented all-rounder Ed Barnard, Dillon Pennington, the who put the wind up Surrey on their way to winning the Championship at New Road, and Pat Brown, hero of Finals day. The Ted Dexter worst timing award Surrey, for awarding four first XI and three second XI county caps at lunchtime on the first day of their last match at the Oval, after their worst morning of the entire season, with the score for seven. The Olly Stone award for catastrophic ill fortune Somerset Jack Leach, who broke his thumb after being hit on the hand with a ball from a dog thrower in the Somerset nets just before the naming of the England Test squad to play Pakistan, and then, in his comeback match at Guildford, was hit on the head and concussed by a snorter from Morne Morkel. The Doug Wright award for hat-trick of the year There were four contenders: two in Somerset final game – by Tom Abell and Craig Overton, Kyle Abbott for Hampshire against Worcestershire; and the winner – Jordan Clark – for his top-class Yorkshire trio of Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Jonny Bairstow. It was the first hat-trick for a Lancastrian in a Roses game since Ken Higgs in at Headingley. Lancashire lost that game years ago and, sure enough, they lost this one too. The CMJ award for coverage of county cricket Kevin Howells of BBC radio and his team of experts for their depth of knowledge and never-ending enthusiasm, even on the dampest of days. The award for best game of the season A draw between The Tie! at Taunton when Jack Leach and Keshav Maharaj took wickets between them, and the end-of-season thriller at the Oval between the new champions and the outgoing champions, where Surrey conceded a first–innings deficit of to Essex, but still came within a single wicket of victory. The Kevin Pietersen award for a temporary truce Yorkshire CCC and Adil Rashid, who managed to put their heads together and agree a new one-year contract after rumbling recriminations surrounding his call-up for England Test duty after declining to play red‑ball cricket for Yorkshire. The Marcus Trescothick award for long service Darren Stevens, and counting, continued to rip through the Division Two batting lineups wickets at as well as wallop a couple of fifties. He signed another one-year contract at the end of the season, and Kent promotion means he will pass his summer back in Division One. The Scott Boswell can’t bear to watch award Poor Haseeb Hameed, who after suffering repeated broken fingers in hit a cataclysmic loss of form for Lancashire and at one point mid‑season seemed to have forgotten completely the whereabouts of his stumps. He’ll come again, roll on The Malcolm Marshall award for best overseas signing Morne Morkel, pure class and Surrey not-so-secret weapon: when he cranked it up, he was unplayable. The Lance Klusener award for what might have been Dom Bess – for his rush of blood at Taunton against Lancashire, bowled going for an almighty heave with the scores level. The Brian Close award for toughing it out Paul Collingwood, a one-club man with the north-east etched into his heart, who stuck by Durham through seasons of thick and thin. If his skills had started to desert him in this final season, his stubbornness hadn’t. Asked what he’d change about cricket, he replied: “Nothing. I can never understand why people are always trying to tinker with the game. Why would you? It stood the test of time.” The Al len Stanford award for style over substance The Hundred. Winter work For Glamorgan , bottom of Division Two, the gloves are off in the shape of an external review. Lancashire , whose batting collapses are the reason they slipped to Division Two and Kent , who got promoted despite repeated first-innings batting failures, will need to strengthen their top orders. Warwickshire and Durham have to survive next season without the wisdom of Jonathan Trott and Paul Collingwood – though Durham gain Ben Raine. Nottinghamshire , who stayed up in Division One by virtue of winning just one more game, have been raiding extensively from their neighbours, Zak Chappell joins from Leicestershire, Joe Clarke from a young and talented Worcestershire, Ben Duckett from Northants and Ben Slater from Derbyshire. Surrey , assuming that Ollie Pope and Rory Burns will both be busy with England, have tempted Jordan Clark down from Lancashire . Their production line will surely chug onwards. Stuart Law joins Middlesex as coach, which will spice things up a bit. All at Lord are hoping that Toby Roland-Jones can continue to recover from that stress-fracture. Andrew Gale rubbished rumours of a divided dressing room at Headingley and, having flirted with relegation, Yorkshire eventually finished fourth. They lost Jack Brooks to Somerset , (where Marcus Trescothick has signed for one more year) and failed to tempt Clarke or Duckett, suggesting there not much cash to flash. However the old place will be transformed for the start of the World Cup next summer, with the new North Stand, shared with Leeds Rhinos, rising fast. Hampshire gain Keith Barker from Warwickshire and hope that Mason Crane too recovers from his stress fracture. His bowling partner Chris Wright joins Leicestershire , who have signed up Pakistan bowler Mohammad Abbas for another year. This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian weekly cricket email.

17,"ore than of the income generated globally by rugby union comes from the international game. It is the reason why those who run the sport, World Rugby, are this week gathered in Sydney pondering how to reinvigorate all the Test rugby that takes place between World Cups. Friendly matches, which make up of Test fixtures, are losing their allure. Teams arrive on tour at the end of long, arduous seasons, often below strength and not at their most motivated. New Zealand remain a draw but Australia and South Africa, who have lost dozens of players to clubs in Europe and Japan, have mutated from vaunted to vulnerable. The series of World Rugby committee meetings this week will resolve nothing. Much has been made this week of a plan to establish a League of Nations competition in November, played over five weeks. But it is one of a number of ideas that are being considered before the governing body meeting in November. What is eventually decided will look a lot different: a commitment made last year was for more fixtures between tier one and two countries. Warren Gatland wants to go out on a high with Wales over next months World Rugby Bill Beaumont and Agustin Pichot, chairman and vice-chairman respectively, are leading the push for reform, with the latter the more voluble after declaring that international rugby was heading for the scrapheap unless there was a fundamental overhaul. At its urging, World Rugby is setting up a professional game committee, made up of tier one and two nations, and is establishing a professional game forum that will meet every year. It will be made up of delegates from unions, clubs and players’ associations and it fulfils a promise made last year in San Francisco to take a collaborative approach to the issues. There will be major changes made to the international calendar and making the November and July windows competitive will add to the load on players. While there would still be three weekends in each month governed by World Rugby regulation on player release, coaches would want two weeks of preparation time. That would make weeks in all which, added to the nine weeks players spend with their countries during the Six Nations, would mean the Test game took up half a season in the non-World Cup years between and Leagues in Europe are attracting the interest of private equity companies who see untapped income in commercial rights. But maximising potential would mean clubs having their leading players for longer than they do now. There does not look to be any scope for a club competition between the best in the hemispheres. The need for clubs to be involved in any change is highlighted by a reason the friendly format is failing – the drift of players from the south to the north. It may prove easier to decide what future Novembers and Julys will look like than to resolve a key question: how should the proceeds from more competitive fixtures be shared? At the moment the match hosts receive all the gate receipts, broadcasting income, commercial deals, apart from a fourth international where the visiting union receives a fee. One reason the All Blacks’ appearances in England and Wales this decade have become less frequent is because of the New Zealand union demand. The southern hemisphere nations have long lobbied for income from tier one matches, including Lions tours, to be pooled and shared out. It would raise the turnover of all four and help them retain players. However the European unions, which attract bigger crowds, have consistently refused to entertain the idea. A friendly revamp with a competitive element would resurrect the issue, especially if there were an overall title sponsor. Europe has found that its greater financial muscle has weakened the international game to the point where to carry on and change nothing would be to redden balance sheets here. England Joe Marler retires from international rugby A new tournament – and that word should be used in the loosest sense because whatever is devised will not be an all-inclusive version of the Six Nations or Rugby Championship – would offer value to backers because it had no past. The Six Nations continues to look for a new title sponsor two years after RBS gave notice. On the surface, it should be easy to sell: it is the sport most popular tournament outside the World Cup, playing to packed houses, it is on terrestrial TV and generates large audiences, it is steeped in tradition and its popularity is not defined by the quality of rugby produced. Yet, little more than four months before the start of the championship, they have still been unable to command the price they want. The uncertainty over Brexit is a factor but, as RBS found, the Six Nations, like the FA Cup, does not lend itself to a sponsor name in the title and backers expect a return. The point of the Sydney summit, and Pichot outburst this month, was to underline the primacy of international rugby, but at a period of flux it is not that simple. If there is a way out, clubs and unions have to walk along the same path, not on parallel lines. This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

19,"here is a particularly interesting episode of Revisionist History , Malcolm Gladwell often fascinating podcast, about Wilt Chamberlain game in the NBA and the importance in achieving that historic record of underhand free throws. Chamberlain was a phenomenal basketball player, but at the particular skill of free throws he was unusually weak. Indeed, only two people in the entire history of the NBA (counting only those with more than attempts – not as many as it sounds) have been worse than him. Across his career Chamberlain had a success rate – horribly bad compared with an NBA average of around and ludicrously inferior to the all-time top free-throw shooters, who average a shade over Surrey and Worcestershire bookend table but share much in between | The Spin But on the night of March Chamberlain was a master. He made of his attempts that night, an success rate, and it was not a one-off. Before that season the Philadelphia Warriors head coach, Frank McGuire, convinced Chamberlain to try throwing underhand, and across that season he made of his free throws. At its end he abandoned the experiment and went back to throwing overhand. In six of the seasons that followed he averaged less than bottoming out at in but there was no going back. The reason for his decision was simple: the underhand method is widely and pejoratively known as a “granny shot”, seen as being the lame recourse of those not skilled enough to throw properly. “I felt silly, like a sissy, shooting underhanded,” Chamberlain wrote in his autobiography. “I know I was wrong. I know some of the best foul shooters in history shot that way. I just couldn’t do it.” In my early childhood games of cricket almost every player had a go at bowling, falling into one of three groups. There were those whose only hope of vaguely threatening the stumps was to bowl underarm, the youthful prodigies who could reliably sling down vaguely accurate overarm deliveries, and the most hapless bunch of them all, those whose ability was no better than the first group but who bowled overarm anyway. These were children who, for fear of making themselves look silly, made themselves look silly. Neville Cardus, the Guardian venerable cricket writer and an advocate of underarm, or lob, bowling, addressed the issue of the style lack of credibility after the death of Sussex brilliant Walter Humphreys in “No doubt the man in the street will smile at the mere mention of lobs. ‘Grubs’, he calls them derisively,” he wrote. “But surely the success of Humphreys’ modest art, at a period great in batsmanship, cannot be dismissed with a smile of indulgence.” Humphreys also helped George Simpson-Hayward, probably the greatest “modern” lob bowler, or lobster as they became known, to hone his art. He spent three years practicing lobs before he first used them in a match, with instant success. Pelham Warner reported that when he made his England debut in South Africa in “the crowd roared with laughter when he first went on”. He took six wickets for runs. The derision with which lob bowling was met was perhaps, Cardus wrote, actually an advantage, helping to tempt batsmen out of dull defensiveness. “A batsman cannot stonewall for long against a lob bowler without feeling, down in his heart, that he is making a fool of himself,” he wrote. But there was more to lob bowling than attempting to humiliate batsmen into getting themselves out. Underarm bowling is inherently more accurate – “the quoit player does not trust an overarm action,” as Cardus notes – and allows greater and more varied spin to be applied to the ball. Plus by the lob bowling was so unusual that opponents no longer knew how best to play it. As Cardus saw it, “every county ought to encourage a likely lob bowler just because every other county doesn’t”. It is also possible to bowl underarm and at pace. David Harris was the fastest bowler of his day (though his day was in the late Century); Brighton George Brown, a tree-trunk-limbed father of who played a century later, was so quick his teams had to deploy two long stops. According to legend on one occasion they both missed the ball, which even when it reached the boundary was going so fast that it struck and instantly killed a passing dog. “We are all too apt to make of our pastimes pretty routine affairs, with too much hard professionalism spoiling the surprise and gusto which are the life and soul of sport,” Cardus opined in “Let us have back the lob then, and the batsman on his toes, the men in the outfield keen and palpitating just a little, the crowd buzzing anticipation.” A first win in England: India and the elephant will never forget | Simon Burnton The world of cricket did not heed the cry. Indeed two years later when Trevor Molony made the first of three appearances for Surrey – taking the wicket of Jack Hobbs in a trial game – the Guardian noted that “lobs are such an unfamiliar sight in these days that his efforts were watched with much interest” (according to the Cricketer on one occasion the batters’ discomfort at his bowling “evinced much laughter from the crowd”). Approaching a century later Molony remains the last specialist lob bowler to play first class cricket. “If we try to discover some explanation for the present universal neglect of lob bowling, we shall probably be right in suggesting as the first and greatest, fashion,” the Guardian wrote in “It does now require some moral courage for a boy to begin and continue bowling lobs in a society which regards them as a slightly fatuous jest.” Would a great lobster have any chance of thriving in today game? It is impossible to say, as nobody alive has ever seen one, and it is unlikely now that they ever shall. The accuracy and unpredictability of Simpson-Hayward represent a test that can only be faced in the imagination. But, and this is the crux, did it die out because it was considered inferior, or because it was considered infantile? This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian weekly cricket email.

21,"Russia is not a repeat of Austria The spectre of Austria continues to hang over every instance of teams employing orders. When Ferrari made Rubens Barrichello move over for Michael Schumacher it was a decision of such cynical overkill it rightly remains infamous. At that point the season was only five races old, Schumacher had won four of them and had twice as many points as his nearest challenger, Juan Pablo Montoya. It was simply unnecessary. Team orders were banned afterwards but it was a rule that proved unenforceable and since they have been legal. In Russia Mercedes’ decision to make Valtteri Bottas cede his place and the win to Lewis Hamilton was not what anyone wanted to see but in what has always been a team sport it was, for them at least, necessary and understandable – incomparable to Hamilton enjoys a strong advantage but remains only a DNF from becoming vulnerable again, making every point vital. Bottas deserved more clarity That Mercedes’ decision to enforce team orders was not pre-ordained however seems clear. The team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted he could not sleep on Saturday night, disturbed by memories of what happened in Austria years ago. The team had discussed options before the race but ultimately appeared to be happy to let their drivers compete. Had they intended a switch, pitting Hamilton first for the undercut on Bottas would have been the simplest method and least damaging in terms of publicity. But they did not do so, stuck to their plan and were forced to take the hard decision when Hamilton blistering tyres threatened his position. Bottas admitted he had not been expecting the call and found it confusing. Mercedes should be lauded for letting them race but perhaps simply making it clear to the Finn that he would be expected to move over before the race began might have made it easier on him. Ferrari left to rue what might have been Mercedes’ ruthless and clear use of orders was an object lesson to the Scuderia , who were hesitant and ambiguous in instructing Kimi Räikkönen to move over for Sebastian Vettel in Germany. As things stand, Ferrari will not be in a position to use them again. Räikkönen looks in no danger of exerting any influence on the fight at the front and even less likely to be amenable to orders now his time with the team is up at the end of this season. Worse still Ferrari, having soundly beaten their rivals in their strongholds of Canada, Britain and Spa, were badly off the pace in Russia. Having repeatedly taken a lead through upgrades across the season, their new package at Sochi was no match for Mercedes. On this form a dispirited Vettel has little hope of taking the fight to Hamilton. He and Ferrari must rue the races that slipped away since Silverstone, when they had a clear advantage. Mercedes move to another level In contrast Mercedes have found just the right time to take their car to a new high. They, too, brought upgrades to Sochi, proving the development war remains in full flight, and it appears their work has really paid off. They were exposed by exit speed from slow corners at Spa but, having acknowledged the problem and looked for mechanical solutions, their exit-traction out of slower corners appeared to have improved radically in Russia. This gives them greater speed on following straights, such as the start-finish run after turn at Sochi. It was here Hamilton was able to close and attack Vettel. He made it stick through turn four having gone round the outside of turn three, an indication that perhaps they have found more from their engine, to match Ferrari previous advantage. Mercedes are proving a finely honed, relentless force, able to draw on the experience and cohesion of the past four seasons of dominance. Leclerc looks a star of the future One positive for Ferrari from Russia was another superb performance from their new signing for Charles Leclerc . The was barely on the radar during the race but, in taking seventh place for Sauber, laid down another marker for what Ferrari can expect next season. What was most impressive was how Leclerc turned his weekend around. He had struggled in both the first two practice sessions, unable to find the set-up and control he needed. Yet he worked at it and by was dialled-in. He converted that to seventh in qualifying and then in the race produced a breathtaking move round the outside of turn three to overtake Kevin Magnussen and maintained his place to be first home behind the big six. He has never driven at Sochi before and his progress over the weekend demonstrated a maturity beyond his years.",794,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/oct/01/mercedes-team-orders-leave-a-sour-taste-in-sochi-as-ferrari-struggle-again-lewis-hamilton-f1
22,"n Wednesday somebody somewhere will become the person to register for Parkrun. Think about that. Let it marinate. It is an extraordinary number for an extraordinary success story. Parkrun began years ago this week, with a simple idea: a free five-kilometre time-trial around Bushy Park, south west London. It was low-key, lo-fi, and unofficial. Thirteen people turned up. The results were typed up in a nearby Caffè Nero. No one bothered to ask the park for permission. Now close to people do it on a good weekend – across countries, including Russia, Malaysia and Swaziland. The ambition is for that figure to climb to a million. On the evidence so far would anyone dare bet against them? How far has fight against doping really come since ‘dirtiest race in history’? | Sean Ingle Yet there is another statistic that is even more striking. And it goes some way to explaining why Parkrun has become such a juggernaut. In the average finish time was minutes and seconds. Last year, having risen every year since then, it was It might sound paradoxical, but Parkrun is absolutely delighted that average times have got so much slower. It shows that its guiding ethos of creating an environment that is inclusive – whether the runner is a beginner or an Olympian – is working. It also knows another iron truth: when something is fun people stick with it, even if it takes them an hour to trudge round. Parkrun hears so many stories of people who have not done any physical activity since school who have taken the plunge – many of whom have been conditioned to think sport isn’t for them. Yet time and again it has proven able to reach parts of the population that other sports cannot. Rich or poor, city or rural, the magic formula seems to work anywhere. There are island communities, such as Bressay in the Shetlands who started a Parkrun to get everyone together at the same time each week. Meanwhile in Ruchill – one of the poorest parts of Glasgow with no library, no health centre, gym or chemist – they have established a Parkrun. There are thousands of who do the junior park run each week. Meanwhile, the oldest regular, John Butcher, is having started his Parkrun journey after he lost his wife on Christmas Day And it is not just about running. In the past years, people have also volunteered – whether it is running an event, high-fiving kids en route, writing reports or taking photographs. It is, truly, the big society in action. Since late June it has also had the stamp of approval from the Royal College of GPs, who have encouraged doctors to prescribe Parkrun for overweight patients and those with some health conditions as an alternative to medication. Already GP surgeries have signed up to become certified Parkrun practices. Yet there are some in sport who are privately sniffy about Parkrun, because they believe it is merely for ‘fun’ runners. They would be better served trying to work out how to absorb its lessons. Remember too that Parkrun is able to get results with a small budget and only a couple of dozen staff. Public bodies such as Sport England, which invests millions of pounds each year into grassroots sport, would love a success story as massive as Parkrun. And while UK Sport, the funding body for elite sport, has been wildly successful in getting Team GB to win Olympic medals, it too knows there is little evidence that those ‘medal moments’ lead to more people participating in sport. Indeed a YouGov survey last year found that only of respondents said they had been inspired to take up sport by watching runners in the Olympics. There is a challenge here for UK Athletics as well. Because there is an obvious disconnect between the social casual runner and the elite levels of the sport. Grassroots football and rugby players identify with top Premier League and Premiership stars – so one would think it would be a given that most Saturday morning park runners would consider themselves as athletes, and want to watch and attend track events. Yet that does not seem to be the case. That said, Parkrun is a gateway for some to become more serious about the sport, with around runners a year subsequently joining an affiliated running club after starting Parkrun. If average membership fees are around a year, that being put into the sport each year. But speaking recently to Parkrun chief executive, Nick Pearson, he emphasised the biggest mission of the organisation was to get more people involved – especially “in areas of social deprivation where the free market has left people behind and there is a lack of provision for physical activities”. He added: “Our ambitions are both modest and huge in the sense that we want to make a greater impact in making more people healthier.” They have certainly made an incredible start. It has became a place to meet your mates and new friends. To get off the couch and to get most of your steps done for the day. And yes, to beat your personal best. Too many times sport is reduced to being about winners and losers. But Parkrun illustrates the vital benefits of thinking fast and slow. Long may it thrive.",890,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/oct/01/parkrun-five-mlllion-runners
23,"Joe Marler will not face any disciplinary action from the Rugby Football Union over comments outlining how he used to try to get himself suspended to avoid England duty. It is understood Marler was contacted by the RFU for clarification over his remarks but the matter will not be taken any further. The announced his surprise international retirement last week, less than months before the World Cup, and speaking to The Rugby Pod, he explained how he would seek a way out of England camps. Marler said: “The anxiety I would get about having to leave and go away again would start to manifest itself in giving away even more dull penalties and looking for outs, looking for a yellow card, looking for a red card, because if I could pick up a ban, that an easy way out without actually pulling the trigger.” Marler subsequently wrote on social media that his comments had been misinterpreted. “I have never deliberately done anything on a rugby pitch – or off it – to get a ban,” he said. “I was simply reflecting on my occasional irrational behaviour when England camps were looming and trying to understand my actions a little bit better.” Joe Marler rocks England World Cup plans with international retirement The timeline of Marler recent ill-discipline correlates with impending spells away with England. Marler was named in the England squad to train in Bristol at the start of last week but pulled out for personal reasons on the Sunday before his decision to retire was made public. The day before, during Harlequins’ defeat by Bristol, he received a yellow card for a forearm to the shoulder/head area of the opposing scrum-half, Andy Uren. “I played like an absolute helmet, which often happened around England time,” he added. “That mindset manifested itself. After that game, I said: ‘I can’t keep doing this. It not fair on my family; it not fair on the club’.” Marler missed England Six Nations matches against Italy and Wales last season after he was suspended for six weeks for a dangerous clear-out on Sale TJ Ioane and in October he was banned for three weeks for striking Wasps’ Will Rowlands in a Champions Cup match, forcing him to miss England opening match of the autumn against Argentina. In addition, Marler spat with James Haskell – for which he received a citing commissioner warning – during another match against Wasps last September occurred five days before Eddie Jones named an England training squad. Last week, Marler cited a desire to spend more time with his family as the key driver for his decision, adding that he was unable to fully give himself to the England cause after winning caps across six years. He has also explained that he weighed up the financial benefits of delaying his retirement, with England players receiving around per match, but revealed he had given serious consideration to taking the decision before the summer tour of South Africa in June. In Marler withdrew from England summer tour of Australia due to the mental strain that came with the furore over his “Gypsy boy” comment to the Wales prop Samson Lee during the Six Nations a few months earlier. He was eventually banned for two matches and fined In his first match back from that ban he picked up another two-week suspension for kicking the Grenoble hooker, Arnaud Héguy, in the head. Marler revealed that because he had previously withdrawn from that tour of Australia his conversation with Jones had been straightforward when informing him of his international retirement. “The relationship which I had with Eddie, based on what I did in and the Australia tour, he knew that if I had decided something , then that was it,” he said. “I pulled out of that tour. So there wasn’t a lot of chat he could give to change my mind.” In the aftermath of Marler announcement last week, the Rugby Players’ Association expressed its concerns that more internationals could follow his lead – a view echoed by the former England captains Phil Vickery and Lawrence Dallaglio, who has championed giving senior players sabbaticals as New Zealand have done in the past.",699,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/02/joe-marler-suspended-avoid-england-duty-rugby-union
24,"ugby autumn internationals will be ready to rumble this time next month. England have a huge game against South Africa at Twickenham, Wales meet Scotland in Cardiff and Ireland face Italy in Chicago. These are big occasions with significant revenues. It is strange, then, that no one in charge of selling tickets, hospitality packages or television subscriptions has added a vital asterisk: two thirds of the competing countries will be fielding weakened teams. Many people will have shelled out for a Twickenham seat – costing up to – keen to see if the visitors can repeat their June series success over England. Can the Boks’ key catalysts, the Wasps full-back Willie le Roux and Sale scrum-half Faf de Klerk, unpick the English defence again? We will never know, because neither man is permitted to play. The date of the game is outside World Rugby official window which means no Premiership-based player will be released, despite there being no league games scheduled that day. World Rugby Sydney committee meetings will struggle to resolve anything | Paul Rees There will also be no shortage of other influential absentees. Gloucester Franco Mostert, Wasps’ Nizaam Carr and Bath Francois Louw will be similarly unavailable to South Africa while Italy cannot field Jake Polledri, their impressive young Gloucester-based back-row, or Exeter Michele Campagnaro. Wales must do without their English contingent of Liam Williams, Dan Biggar, Tomas Francis Taulupe Faletau, Jamie Roberts, Luke Charteris and Josh Adams. Scotland Sean Maitland and Byron McGuigan, of Saracens and Sale respectively, further extend the list. Does this really matter? There will, after all, still be plenty of other grateful players keen to take their places and win a cap. The Tests will still happen, the same badge-clutching anthems will be played. Premiership Rugby is obliged to release its players for only a certain number of weeks per year and all involved – hey presto! – will be available for international duty again the following week. A shrug of the shoulders, however, misses the broader point. The vexed relationship between club and country remains rugby running sore, at the heart of the endless power struggle between the various factions involved. If South Africa cannot put out their strongest side for one of the biggest games of the year, then surely that cheapens the whole sport? If England win well, does that mean Eddie Jones side are back on track or simply that they took advantage of weakened opposition? If it is obviously the latter, everyone loses out. It is made worse, in this instance, by the fact that the Wales v Scotland fixture will be played for the Doddie Weir Cup, in honour of the former Scotland and Lions forward who has motor neurone disease. Part of the reason why the fixture exists is to raise funds and awareness for Weir My Doddie Foundation. When it was announced, the Welsh Rugby Union chief executive, Martyn Phillips, described it as “a rare chance for a much broader base of supporters to experience a match of this magnitude” and spoke of the “years of tradition and rivalry which should appeal to rugby supporters across both countries”. How desperately sad if the monies raised for such a wonderful cause were to be even slightly reduced by petty politicking. Of course there is the weighty counter argument that Test matches should not be scheduled outside the window anyway. The accusation, not without foundation, is that these games exist only for financial rather than sporting reasons, that the unions involved care little for the clubs’ interests and are happy to ride roughshod over the domestic schedule. Twenty-three years after the game went professional the whole self-harming debate rages on. World Rugby confirmed at the end of last week it is looking to jazz up the July and November windows by making the matches collectively more meaningful; the Rugby Football Union and the English clubs are set to confirm towards the end of next week what their vision for the newly structured calendar from looks like. What both sides are overlooking in all this are the players: where is the schedule that allows Le Roux, say, to display his brilliance for both club and country and enjoy sufficient rest to ensure the magic keeps happening for years to come? Last week abrupt departure of Joe Marler from the Test scene may or may not have been a symptom of burnout – the Harlequins prop is a devoted family man – but it is obvious that, physically and mentally, the game is accelerating towards a place where it will no longer soon be practicable or healthy for one individual to play upwards of games – soon enough that might be – in a calendar year. It is in everyone interests to sit down together and reassess. Tests absolutely have to matter, clubs need their own uninterrupted space and the players should be consulted more. Is it, in the end, really that complicated? And here, just to concentrate everyone minds, is a stark warning from the international players association. “From a player perspective we’re obviously concerned,” says Omar Hassanein, chief executive of the International Rugby Players’ Association. “If you look at the number of minutes English players are already playing relative to some other countries, we’d argue they’re being overplayed. We need to try and curb that before the situation gets considerably worse for these guys.” For all their sakes the club versus country arm-wrestling has to stop. Wobbly shield Barely a month into the new season and not all is well with the new-look Premiership Shield in England, the expanded reserve team competition that has replaced the old A league. Three fixtures have already had to be postponed because of teams being unable to raise a side, while others have gone ahead only after the mass recruitment of ‘guests’ from local clubs. One Premiership chief executive is already describing the concept as “untenable”, given some clubs are struggling to field competitive sides even before injuries and the winter weather start to bite. A Premiership Rugby meeting next week will decide what sanctions, if any, to issue to those clubs responsible for postponements amid growing disquiet among club figures who view the competition as essential in terms of promoting and developing young talent. “It going to take time,” a Premiership spokesman said. And finally … Rugby is not short of deserving causes but anyone who can possibly get to Twickenham this Saturday should try to attend the relocated east midlands “derby” between Northampton and Leicester. The occasion is part of a concerted fund-raising effort for Rob Horne, the Australian international, who suffered a career-ending and life‑changing injury in last season corresponding fixture.

25,"f Rugby Australia is not prepared to make the tough call to remove Michael Cheika , the Wallabies coach may have to do the honourable thing and fall on his sword. Rugby Australia chief-executive Raelene Castle recently declared Cheika would see out his contract until the World Cup in Japan next year. But the Wallabies’ loss to the Springboks in Port Elizabeth last Sunday – their eighth loss in their last Tests – has dramatically increased the pressure on Rugby Australia to make a change. Rugby union power rankings: All Blacks still despite rare defeat | Gerard Meagher If the Wallabies lose to Argentina in their last Test of the Rugby Championship in Salta on Sunday, Cheika position will be almost untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheika win-loss record has fallen to an unacceptable per cent with wins from Tests since replacing Ewen McKenzie towards the end of Since reaching the final of the World Cup, the Wallabies have made little or no progress. In fact, the team has gone backwards, dropping to seventh in the world rankings, their lowest ever position. No other Wallabies coach in the professional era could have produced such a woeful record and managed to survive. One of the main arguments for keeping Cheika, regardless of results, is that there is no one to replace him. Wallabies attack coach Stephen Larkham has been touted as a potential successor to Cheika, but if Cheika goes, his whole coaching staff should go with him. There are certainly no Australian Super Rugby coaches putting up their hand for the top job. Rugby Australia should appoint an experienced international coach – Australian or foreign – to steer the Wallabies through the World Cup in Japan. A coach who has been there and done that at a World Cup – a Jake White, Robbie Deans, John Connolly or even former All Blacks World Cup-winning assistant coach Wayne Smith. Australia best Super Rugby coaches could be seconded as assistants. Rugby Australia would then have the time to conduct a worldwide search for the best possible coach to take the Wallabies to the World Cup. You might argue that a new coach would have insufficient time to prepare the Wallabies for the World Cup next year, but Cheika has already proven a team can be turned around in a short period of time. The Wallabies entered the World Cup year ranked sixth in the world, but still reached the final of the World Cup, although their subsequent performances suggest that result was an aberration. At the World Cup Cheika forged a Wallabies identity similar to the one that helped the NSW Waratahs win their maiden Super Rugby title in but does anyone know what the identity of the Australian team is now? Latest Wallabies disappointment underlines need for change | Bret Harris The Wallabies coaching staff seems intent on devising completely different tactics for each Test, which means they are virtually starting from scratch every week rather than creating variations on a core style of play and maintaining their identity. The way the Wallabies attacked the Springboks in Port Elizabeth bore no resemblance to their tactical approach in their loss to Argentina on the Gold Coast in their previous Test. Winger Israel Folau was used as a crash ball runner in the mid-field against Argentina, but he was hardly utilized against the Springboks. The Wallabies tried to throw long cut-out passes to beat the Springboks’ rush defence in the mid-field, but lacked the skill to execute the strategy consistently. The South Africans were alert to the tactic. Not only did the Springboks have the Wallabies’ strike players covered out wide for the most part, they invariably arrived at the wider breakdowns in numbers and turned the ball over. It was mind-boggling that the Wallabies did not try to put a kick behind the Springboks’ rush defence, particularly when fullback Willie le Roux defended in the front-line after winger Aphiwe Dyantyi was sin-binned. Or they could have used fullback Dane Haylett-Petty, who produces the most post-contact metres of any Walllabies back – at second receiver from the set-pieces to confront the rush defence headlong and get across the advantage line. And why did the Wallabies not try to capitalize on Folau height advantage and aerial skill over diminutive Springbok winger Cheslin Kolbe? Too obvious, I guess. Certainly, there were signs of improvement from the Wallabies, particularly in the scrum, but there was still too much going wrong and someone needs to be accountable. Cheika possesses wonderful managerial and motivational skills and it would be a great pity to lose those attributes, but the current coaching set-up is just not working.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A self-made man, Cheika always says that he does not coach for the money, but for the passion and to see the Wallabies performing as best they can. If there is no sign of a turnaround against Argentina on Sunday and Rugby Australia refuses to act, Cheika should seriously consider his position and be very certain he is putting the interests of his country first.",838,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/02/argentina-test-looms-as-d-day-for-michael-cheika-and-wallabies
26,"Worcester Warriors’ new owners have confirmed the team will remain at their Sixways home following a takeover by a consortium that includes the former Swindon Town chairman Jed McCrory.

David Seymour, the former Sale and Saracens flanker, is also part of the consortium. In the past months the former Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths has been linked with leading a takeover bid while the Scottish Rugby Union was also interested in the club and last November the Worcester chairman, Bill Bolsover, admitted he could not rule out a move away from Sixways. But the new owners have revealed plans to develop the site “with the intentions of making the club self-sustainable and achieving long-term success on and off the field”. Rugby union: talking points from the Premiership weekend action Worcester finances were laid bare by the Guardian in August. They were the only club last year whose wage bill exceeded turnover and the finance director, Kirsty Fisher, resigned in July after only months at the club. Worcester were also shown to have loans worth over still outstanding. In their strategic report the club noted that central funding was not tracking in line with the hike in the salary cap, resulting in increased player costs, but the new owners have made a commitment to “investing above a certain threshold into the rugby budget”. Bolsover, who will remain on the board, said: “We have found long-term owners who are capable of taking the club to the next level. Our search has been extensive and the whole process has been a thorough one to ensure we found the right owners who have the backing to take this club forward. “The new owners have that backing and, with it, a clear vision to ensure Warriors can achieve long-term success and become one of the top clubs in the Premiership.

If we count only those that finish within a score, it comes in at fourth. Even the Kiwis seem impressed. Todd Blackadder the other week was resigned to the need just to score more than the opposition. This week Chris Boyd bemoaned the defence but accepted that when players look for space they are capable of finding it. Michael Aylwin Match report: Bristol Northampton Chiefs’ home rule gives table air of predictability up top It is hard to argue with Alan Solomons when he says the Premiership is already a two-horse race between Exeter and Saracens. Both have records and it is hard to see either losing theirs at home, particularly if teams are going to make as many changes as Bath did at Saracens on Saturday. Exeter meanwhile, overcame Solomons Worcester with room to spare at Sandy Park and look on course for a Twickenham rematch with Saracens at the season end. The places below them may be harder to predict than ever, which is key part of the reason the Premiership has witnessed so many thrilling contests recently. At the top, though, there is an air of predictability to proceedings. Gerard Meagher Harlequins’ newfound backbone faces acid test Harlequins moved up to fourth after their away win against a Gloucester side who would have frustrated the Shed, so prescriptive was their play. Quins’ next fixture is at home against Saracens on Saturday night. The champions have spent the past two weekends sending opponents who started the round in fourth place, Gloucester and Bath, scuttling down the table and Quins, never mind their first away league win for a year, are in similarly fickle form. But they have won their past three home league fixtures against Saracens and are developing some backbone. Paul Rees Match report: Gloucester Harlequins Will De Klerk long-distance trips drive a Sale turnaround? Kyle Eastmond try helps Leicester pin Sale to the bottom of Premiership After a poor, nervy contest much of the post-match discussion revolved around two players who were not involved. Sale have revealed their South African scrum-half Faf de Klerk will be available to the club throughout the autumn international period, with an agreement having been reached with the Boks for the No to remain in the southern hemisphere during the spare weeks in the Rugby Championship. With their game against England also falling outside the official Test window, Premiership Rugby regulations are also set to sideline other English-based Boks such as Willie Le Roux and Francois Louw for the Twickenham date. Leicester, meanwhile, might not risk recalling Manu Tuilagi for the game against Northampton this weekend. Tuilagi hamstring ruled him out of England training last week – “There wasn’t really much point in him getting in the car with a tight hamstring to go down and stand around on the sidelines,” said Geordan Murphy – and a return against the Saints is not yet certain. “It a question of whether or not he ready to roll next weekend, whether or not we need to use him or whether we rest him for another week,” Murphy said. Robert Kitson Match report: Leicester Sale Mesmeric Sinoti suggests Falcons are ready to take off Three home defeats from three is a run of form that would ordinarily be of concern for Newcastle until you consider their opponents have been the Premiership top three sides from last season. The defeat by Wasps on Friday will have hurt most, having been ahead with minutes to go but the Falcons still have plenty about which to be optimistic. Sinoti Sinoti was at his mesmeric best against Wasps and Johnny Williams at inside-centre is further demonstration of Dean Richards canny recruitment. They have already won once on the road this season and their ability to do so last term was a fundamental part of their run to the semi-finals. On Saturday they go to Sale.

28,"Alex Goode has revealed he has not heard from Eddie Jones for nearly two years but the Saracens full-back has not given up hope of forcing his way into England World Cup squad. The was in magical form on Saturday, scoring one try and setting up another three as the champions romped to a fifth successive bonus-point win of the season, by against an underpowered Bath side featuring changes from the previous week. In total he made metres with five clean breaks, beating eight defenders in the kind of performance to which regulars at Allianz Park have grown accustomed. His last England cap came in November and he has not been selected in any of Jones squads since that autumn. But recent long-awaited recalls for Chris Ashton and Danny Cipriani – even if the latter is out in the cold again – demonstrate that, with the World Cup in Japan next year, the door is never closed. “I was on the phone with him in December Goode said. “He didn’t say too much. He just said I wasn’t in the squad and he didn’t think I was playing at a good enough level. You can’t let it grind you down or get too down about these things otherwise it just takes over all your thinking. I always want to represent England; that fire will never burn out. It is a privilege to do that and is something I want to do. I am on the outside but all I can do is keep working hard.” Alex Goode leads the charge for irrepressible Saracens against Bath Last season Jones started to employ Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson as pacy full-back alternatives to Mike Brown but Goode rejects the idea that he is either too slow or lightweight for international rugby. After the match on Saturday Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, praised his full‑back for his work behind the scenes to improve his speed and Goode revealed it has been paying off. He said: “The last two years, having not been on tour, allowed me to have full pre-seasons both times and in both years – we saw it more the back end of last year and this year – this has allowed me to really work on my leg speed, power and acceleration through contact. Even at the tender age of I’m still getting improvements. The GPS says I’m quicker this pre-season than I’ve ever been before.”",407,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/alex-goode-saracens-england-eddie-jones
29,"Few will remember this contest with affection but winning ugly, at this precise moment, is perfectly fine with Leicester . Had they lost at home to the league basement dwellers Sale and recorded a fourth defeat in five games a proper East Midlands crisis would have had to be declared. As it is, the Tigers now lie seventh in the table, no cause for celebration but enough to call off the hounds for the time being. To describe this as a revival, though, would be strictly relative. Leicester were outscored by three tries to one and, had the Sharks shown even a fraction more composure in their opponents’ the outcome would have been very different. Without George Ford all-round influence, Kyle Eastmond try and the unceasing efforts of, among others, Guy Thompson and Graham Kitchener, the Tigers might have endured another sorry Sunday. Sale captain Jono Ross: it far too early to talk about relegation Sale also missed all three of their conversions plus an eminently kickable first-half penalty, in stark contrast to Ford who slotted everything for a personal tally of points. On three occasions, furthermore, when the visitors looked about to grab a potentially game-defining try, they came away with nothing. Will Cliff knocked on wastefully at the base of a scrum, Sam James failed to find touch with a mishit penalty kick to the corner – two of Sale five-pointers came from lineout drives – and, under the posts with three minutes left, Josh Beaumont was unluckily penalised for not releasing under pressure from Thompson. As Leicester interim head coach, Geordan Murphy, acknowledged: “The points and win are important but I thought our performance was below par.” In such a dog-eat-dog league he is well aware the Tigers will have to sharpen up considerably, with very little separating the clubs between fourth and in the table. The Sharks may be rock bottom now but there is every prospect of them being significantly harder to beat in the near future when key players such as Chris Ashton, James O’Connor and Faf De Klerk become available again. They are particularly looking forward to welcoming back their buzzing scrum-half De Klerk who, it has emerged, will not be involved at all with South Africa during the November Tests. In return for releasing him for his country Rugby Championship fixtures, Sale have negotiated first call on him next month with the Springboks also set to face England without their other Premiership-based players Willie le Roux, Nizaam Carr and Francois Louw. Northampton secure victory in breathless encounter at Bristol As Steve Diamond was quick to stress, the South Africa game at Twickenham technically falls outside the international window, which means Premiership Rugby are not obliged to release players despite the fact there are not any Premiership fixtures scheduled that weekend. “After Newcastle this Friday Faf comes back to us pretty much full time,” Diamond confirmed. “We didn’t see the benefit of bringing him back during the break weeks, so he’ll come back to us after the Rugby Championship.” A half-decent goal-kicker would certainly have assisted the Sharks here, with the late withdrawal of the fly-half AJ MacGinty also reducing their ability to play a territorial game. They did start reasonably well with a sixth-minute try from Marland Yarde but in terms of skill and execution on both sides the game at no stage threatened to rival the rich golfing drama unfolding across the Channel. Even after Ford had kicked his fourth penalty to put Leicester ahead with three minutes left the hosts contrived to make life unnecessarily difficult for themselves, conceding a third try to a close-range drive finished off by the replacement Curtis Langdon with a restart still to come. Had Rohan Janse van Rensburg touched down Ford long drop-out it would have led to a scrum back on halfway with Sale still in the hunt. It somehow summed up the day that the ball was instead allowed to roll dead, prompting the referee, Craig Maxwell-Keyes, to blow the final whistle.",670,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/leicester-sale-premiership-match-report
30,"Kurtley Beale has done his best to recover from a first-minute brain explosion, but it wasn’t enough to stem the bleeding as the struggling Wallabies fell to the Springboks in Port Elizabeth. Things couldn’t have started worse for the visitors after Beale ambitious pass was intercepted in the second and South Africa quickly jumped to a lead on Saturday night. Australia did well to recover and threw a bulk of the late punches as they controlled per cent of possession in the second half. Try and try again: Japan Rugby World Cup But, like a fortnight ago in the Gold Coast loss to Argentina, they lacked the polish needed to exploit it and eventually ran out of gas in the face of incredible cover defence. It marked their sixth loss from eight Tests this year and adds further pressure on coach Michael Cheika and his squad less than months out from the World Cup. Beale bewildering speculator looked destined for nobody other than Springboks winger Aphiwe Dyantyi, who caught the floating pass just metres from the tryline for a gift five-pointer. It set the tone for a manic opening minutes in front of nearly boisterous fans at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium before they rallied to head to the sheds only down. “I thought he came back from that pretty well really,” the coach said of his No “That would’ve spooked him a bit, but I thought the rest of his game was pretty solid. “It was two tries all – we basically gave one away and then we had a lot of good footy – but you’ve got to capitalise on your moments don’t you.” David Pocock was arguably Australia best with three clean steals in the first minutes, steadying the side before Will Genia manufactured some points. First the scrumhalf cut out two men in a perfect assist for Reece Hodge in the corner. Then he finished a five-pointer created by fullback Dane Haylett-Petty bust and offload to make it in the minute. World Rugby Sydney committee meetings will struggle to resolve anything | Paul Rees Earlier Faf de Klerk slid through after Handre Pollard broke Folau Fainga’a tackle to make it in the minute. Rassie Erasmus side backed up well from their defeat of the All Blacks a fortnight ago, making nearly double the tackles of Australia and continually shutting down the visitor expansive forays. But he was equally critical of his side efficiency, cheekily suggesting it could have been far uglier for the visitors. “We didn’t play tactically well, but the guts the boys showed, the character again was great,” South African coach Rassie Erasmus said. “We definitely created a hell of a lot of opportunities; I thought if we scored (from them) we could’ve given them a good, good hiding.” The Wallabies now head straight to Argentina, where they play Los Pumas next weekend in Salta.

31,"Another weekend, another points fest. This one topped the odd try in earning Northampton their second win of the season. Under Chris Boyd, the improvement in their game has been obvious; here, it yielded the full five points. It meant Bristol first home loss of their return to the top flight fell at the third instalment, but they took two bonus points themselves to keep both sides nestled amid the customarily crowded mid-table. Nathan Earle tries lead Harlequins to narrow win at Gloucester Ian Madigan pulled out, but his replacement, Callum Sheedy, who qualifies to play for Wales, Ireland and England, played masterfully, accruing points and coaxing as much artistry from Bristol as Madigan might have done himself. If this league is meant to be damaging England chances of playing the vibrant rugby so ardently wished for, the logic is hard to follow. Players looked for, and found, space and, when it was not to be found, collisions of rather more than a couple of Gs kept the purists happy. In the end, the difference was a try, which made the one denied Bristol shortly before the break all the more controversial. With the score locked at Andy Uren was through to the line. He had been tackled a few yards short, his knee touching the ground for a moment, but the question was whether he had been held by the tackler. The TMO thought not; Luke Pearce, whose opinion counted, thought so. “I know it was a try,” said Pat Lam, the Bristol coach whose birthday was spoiled here by his former club. “The TMO was right and so was the touch-judge, but Luke felt differently. I know what going to be said when it goes to review. It was a huge moment, because it switched from in our favour to the other way. But credit to Northampton.” It was a curious decision by Pearce, who cannot have seen anything the rest of us could not. If that was harsh, a penalty seemed ridiculous, but them the rules. All the harsher, Northampton kicked the penalty to touch, worked a few phases and suddenly Lewis Ludlam was stepping to the line at the other end. Northampton had a lead they would not relinquish. By then that lead had changed hands liberally. Dan Biggar had opened the scoring with a penalty, but the riot of tries was swift to ensue. Will Hurrell broke powerfully past Biggar for the first of his brace, after fine work by the increasingly eye-catching Harry Thacker. The hooker showcased his remarkable pace for Bristol second on the half-hour, but in between Northampton had scored twice – raw power accounting for Ehren Painter and the contrasting virtues of Northampton wingers for Andrew Kellaway. Alex Goode leads the charge for irrepressible Saracens against Bath And so the match was poised perfectly before its controversial turning point. Even after that, Sheedy penalty reduced Bristol arrears to four on the stroke of half-time. Taqele Naiyaravoro, the bulldozing version of Northampton wingers, went through two to claim Northampton fourth four minutes into the second half, only for some Sheedy wizardry to lay one on for Luke Morahan four minutes later. Sheedy third penalty reduced the deficit to one. The game was anyone. It was Northampton who made it theirs. Close-quarter power was one department in which they enjoyed the edge throughout. Alex Waller and Mikey Haywood proved as much with tries of directness either side of the hour mark. Bristol were staring at a deficit all of a sudden, this time with only quarter of an hour to go. They scored twice in the remaining time, each try coming with a bonus point, each one a sweeping move of majesty. They were the scores of a team who know how to play, but everyone seems to know how to play this season. Someone is going to have to be relegated.",649,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/bristol-northampton-premiership-match-report
32,"Whatever happened to staple English fare? This offering was typical of what is being served up in the Premiership , fast, fluid, frantic, furious and, at times, fractious, but fulfilling? It was like gorging greedily on a rich trifle without pausing for a sip of water. There was little strategic about the play at a period in the game when possession is king – exciting but ephemeral as Harlequins won away in the league for the first time in months. It is about waiting for mistakes, as the first two tries demonstrated. Gloucester scored the first, from a lineout near their after Martin Atkinson short pass to Jake Polledri caught out the visitors’ fly-half James Lang who had shaped to tackle with his inside shoulder only to find the danger on his outside. The flanker sprinted metres before finding Danny Cipriani on his left and the outside-half comfortably outstripped the cover. Northampton secure victory in breathless encounter at Bristol Cipriani had an instrumental role in the next try four minutes later, scored by one of Harlequins’ five England squad members, Nathan Earle. Gloucester were moving left when Cipriani passed to the flanker Lewis Ludlow who was standing too flat and close. Like a batsman beaten for pace, all Ludlow could do was flick the ball on and it fell for Earle out. Earle second came from the kick-off. Harlequins moved the ball from their spotting space wide. Three quick passes put Joe Marchant into the gap and it was a question of the centre timing his pass to Earle. He waited until he had reached the home committing the cover before releasing the ball, although Gloucester full-back Tom Hudson nearly thwarted the try. From a position of comfort, Gloucester were down. They set up camp in Quins’ kicking five penalties to touch even though their mauls tended to lurch rather than roll. They eventually went for the posts, Cipriani kicking two penalties to cut his side deficit to a point. The second came after the second-row forward Matt Symons received a yellow card for his side persistent infringing. Gloucester exploited their man advantage two minutes from the interval when their forwards stormed the gainline and Atkinson long pass led to Charlie Sharples’ fifth try of the season. Quins drew level with Lang penalties either side of the interval. On top of their dismal away record, they had lost of their previous league fixtures. If Paul Gustard has not sat on defence since moving to the Stoop from Twickenham in the summer, there were times here when they, like Gloucester, needed to take a breath but this is a Premiership campaign when a team has kept its line intact only once, Exeter against Leicester on the opening weekend. Alex Goode leads the charge for irrepressible Saracens against Bath Joe Marler was making his first appearance for Harlequins since deciding to roll away from international rugby. Opposite him was Cipriani, desperate to continue at Test level but outside looking in again. As the reflected on the insistence of the England head coach, Eddie Jones, that form was his barometer, he may have asked himself how so many Quins had made it. Mike Brown was one, making his first appearance of the season and typically competitive, but it was someone who had dropped out of favour, Marcus Smith, who tilted the game after replacing Lang at No He kicked two penalties and, after Sharples had regained the lead for Gloucester minutes from time, landed a third having blown his clean break by slipping and conceding a scrum that the home prop Alex Seville rashly used his hands in after Quins’ three front-row replacements applied pressure. Gloucester had a final rally when their ploy was to get the ball to Matt Banahan, but they had not worked out a way to win and another twisted scrum marked their end on a day when even Cipriani got lost in the uniformity spawned by the relentless quest to entertain.",663,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/gloucester-harlequins-premiership-match-report
33,"For all that Saracens’ swashbuckling style, led by the irrepressible Alex Goode, caught the eye in a record-breaking fifth consecutive bonus point win, it is Todd Blackadder post-match revelation – that the sum total of Bath ambitions was a losing bonus point – which resonates most. Blackadder made changes to his side, resting his two England squad members and a raft of senior players at a ground where Bath are accustomed to heavy defeats. “We are creating more depth, we are freshening people up and we are learning about ourselves,” he said. “Even though we didn’t get what we were after, all we were really after was chasing a bonus point today.” It must be said that Bath rallied to trail by just six points at half-time and Blackadder was adamant that “you don’t prepare to lose”, but his admission is nonetheless startling. Blackadder argument is that Bath host Exeter on Friday, then have two Champions Cup matches and after an injury-hit campaign last season he saw the chance to expose his squad players to the white heat of battle. “I absolutely stand by it,” he added. “We’re trying to break the habit of breaking people all the time. I’d rather bring these young guys to play against the best so that they know what the benchmark is. Otherwise we’ll just end up playing our best team every single week and we’ll end up breaking guys. I just don’t think that the way forwards.” The counterpoint is that Bath came into the match fourth in the table and are a club with an illustrious history but at a time when a England prop has just retired from international duty, Blackadder argument is at the very least timely, all the more so with the Rugby Football Union, in association with Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Players’ Association, soon to announce the new domestic structure. He denied it was anything to do with England training camp in Bristol, which ran from last Sunday to Tuesday, but left Joe Cokanasiga and Zach Mercer out of the squad completely. Meanwhile, there were nine Saracens players away with England and eight of them started, causing their chairman, Nigel Wray, to lament in his programme notes a “difficult week” in which his club had been “penalised”. Perhaps it is no coincidence then that Goode, by a distance the star turn, is England forgotten man. Eddie Jones clearly sees something he does not like but when he is performing with this type of spidery elusiveness he is a joy to behold. “It says a lot about his hunger to play at the highest level,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. “He still wants to play for England and he works incredibly hard for it.” After eight here, Saracens have now scored tries so far this season and they are the first ever side to start a campaign with five straight bonus point wins. If there was a downside it was a nasty-looking facial injury to Brad Barritt, but Liam Williams finished the match with his second hat-trick of the season and Goode was majestic, breaking Bath line at will. It seems staggering he has not played for England since November After an opening Rhys Priestland penalty, Williams finished off a lovely move from left to right before Goode ran a superb line to take Alex Lozowski fizzing pass for the second try. Priestland added another penalty but Jamie George was barged over from the back of a driving lineout and Saracens were threatening to run riot. The procession did not materialise as Chris Cook picked off Richard Wigglesworth pass for an interception try before Nick Tompkins dummied over for Saracens’ bonus-point score. Tom Homer was on hand for another Bath try before the break – for all that the hosts impressed in attack this was not their best defensive performance by a stretch – but Williams had his second and third soon after the interval, Goode making yet another fine break and offload for the second of those. Bath stayed in the hunt with another intercept, this time from Homer, but Sean Maitland then got in on the act on the left for Saracens’ seventh score and the replacement hooker, Christopher Tolofua, added the eighth from another driving lineout.",714,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/saracens-bath-premiership-match-report
34,"It may be too early in the season to describe Sunday meeting of Leicester and Sale at Welford Road as an eight-pointer but with the Manchester club starting the fifth round at the bottom of the Premiership and the Tigers having the worst defensive record after the opening four rounds, there will be little comfort for the loser in a season when, without an obvious struggler, every point counts. “We are not looking at the table,” insists the Sale captain, Jono Ross. “There are still games to play. We have not had the start we wanted in the toughest of leagues because we have not been good enough. We have to improve and that starts with hard work. It is far too early to be talking about relegation and all we are focusing on is Leicester .” Stuart Hooper to replace Todd Blackadder at Bath in While the shape of the domestic season from is expected to be announced in the next couple of weeks after prolonged discussions between the Rugby Football Union, Premiership Rugby and the Professional Rugby Players’ Association, relegation will remain despite talk of ringfencing the elite. The only possible reprieve for the team finishing bottom will be if the Championship winners do not meet the entry criteria. With promoted Bristol winning two of their first four matches and Worcester, the pre-season relegation favourites, triumphant at Leicester having been pipped by a point by Wasps in the opening round, the comfort blanket of a team detached from the rest from early in the campaign has been snatched away. The bottom three clubs going into the latest round of matches were all former champions, Sale , Northampton and Newcastle. Two others, Leicester and Harlequins, were higher up the table, after one victory each in four, because of bonus points. The prospect of a big-name casualty – the last was Northampton in – is real. “There are no weak teams in the Premiership,” says Ross. “You look at Leicester squad and it is full of quality. It is the same with us but it is all about putting in a performance. We have played well in parts in all of our four games but we have not put it together for minutes. We have been falling away and that has to stop.” Sydney summit feels like a pivotal moment in rugby modern history | Robert Kitson Leicester sacked their head coach, Matt O’Connor, three days into the season after losing at Exeter while Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond, reacted to their first home defeat by Wasps for eight years last weekend by recruiting the former Northampton forwards coach Dorian West and pledging some old-school training. “There was a fair bit of work done,” says Ross, who had given his side the ideal start against Wasps with a first-minute try. “Everyone was disappointed by the result and we have been taking a hard look at ourselves in the mirror. Dorian will add to our forward game and his experience should help us find an edge there.” There should be tries at Welford Road. Leicester have conceded this season, while Sale have the next leakiest defence, having been breached times. “At this stage of the season a lot can change quickly,” says Ross. “A couple of wins and you are in the top half of the table. We have to stay positive. It will be tough on Sunday but that is the case every time you play in the Premiership.”",580,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/jono-ross-sale-captain-too-early-to-talk-about-relegation
35,"A late Lima Sopoaga penalty snatched a victory for Wasps at Kingston Park. The Falcons led at half time and then when Johnny Williams grabbed his second try, but a scorching score from Juan de Jongh converted by Sopoaga made it and the Wasps fly-half then landed a crucial penalty with eight minutes left for Wasps to clinch the points. In a climactic finish Newcastle ran the ball back out when Sopoaga missed another shot with seconds on the clock and they went through phases and six minutes of overtime before their brave attempt to save the game foundered. Simon Hammersley, Toby Flood and Vereniki Goneva all made early breaks and it needed a very good tackle from Sopoaga to halt the Falcons full-back but Wasps got on scoreboard first with a try. Controversial Leicester red card spoils eight-try classic as Wasps prevail Sopoaga missed a long-range penalty but his clever kick through set up a try for Josh Bassett which the referee, Karl Dickson, initially ruled out but then awarded after he checked with the TMO, Sean Davey. It looked as if Hammersley tackle had driven Bassett over the dead ball line but replays showed the winger had got the ball down in time to make it Sopoaga missing the conversion. Newcastle hit back five minutes later with Sinoti Sinoti pinballing off defenders from Hammersley pass before finding Mark Wilson and the England forward rumbled in for his fourth try of the season. Flood tried a quick drop-goal attempt for the conversion – he missed it – which indicated there may have been some doubt about the try. Sopoaga did the same when Michael le Bourgeois appeared to have scored in the minute under the posts but Dickson stepped in, asked for the TMO who ruled there had been a knock-on and Wasps had to be satisfied with a penalty from Sopoaga for offside. Davey was called on again on the half-hour when Newcastle went to the corner three times with penalties and Johnny Williams eventually forced his way over. On review Davey awarded the try and Flood converted and then kicked a penalty for offside to make it but Newcastle comprehensively failed to handle the restart, Wasps camping on the Falcons line, and from the resulting scrum Sopoaga threw an outrageous one-handed overhead pass for Marcus Watson to score in the corner against his former club to make it at the break. Santiago Cordero: ‘England should worry. Argentina are getting better and better’ A massive run from Gary Graham was carried on by Sinoti who was hauled down close to the line and Williams snapped it up to go in – again after the TMO was called in – and Flood converted for in the minute. It seemed Tom Penny had scored after Adam Brocklebank broke through and Goneva inside pass led to a touchdown but the TMO was involved again and it showed Penny was in touch. It was something of a turning point with Wasps dominating the possession which followed and a couple of breathtaking moves had the Falcons scramble defence stretched and eventually broken when De Jongh scorched over and Sopoaga conversion made it in the minute. The Wasps fly-half then kicked the penalty from metres when Newcastle started offside to put his side ahead and Wasps held on in a frantic finish.",558,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/28/newcastle-wasps-premiership-match-report
36,"t is Santiago Cordero own choice but a life in rugby exile can be testing. On Saturday the could have been running out against the All Blacks in Buenos Aires, facing the haka and standing shoulder to shoulder with his best mates for the national anthems. Instead he will be in distant Devon, plying his trade for Exeter Chiefs against Worcester at Sandy Park before heading home to watch his beloved Pumas from his sofa. Across Europe there are around players who, were they not based abroad, would be strong contenders for Argentina squad. Juan Imhoff at Racing Juan Figallo at Saracens, Facundo Isa at Toulon: as with Cordero, these are not modest journeymen but major talents. All are now looking on from afar, unable to do more than cheer the Pumas’ recent wins over South Africa and Australia and the team highly encouraging performance in defeat to New Zealand in Nelson. The big question is what happens next. The Pumas have a new head coach in Mario Ledesma and cracks are already discernible in the “home-based only” policy introduced to try to keep Argentina better players at home. Two overseas-based players – Figallo and Stade Français Ramiro Herrera – have already been selected for Rugby Championship duty and, a year out from the World Cup, there is a good case for whistling up a few more for this November internationals. Alex Cuthbert first try helps Exeter overcome Sale for best start Cordero is realistic enough to know the odds remain lengthy: Argentina back three have been playing well and his prospects of featuring in the World Cup in Japan remain slim. It does not stop him dreaming, or predicting that England will face a horribly tough pool encounter with the Pumas in Tokyo next year. “England should be worried,” he stresses. “Argentina have improved a lot in the past few months and the boys are getting better and better. I think the next World Cup will be amazing for Argentina.” If Cordero increasing impact at upwardly-mobile Exeter is any guide, the Pumas should consider giving him a call. His wonderfully quick feet have yielded two tries in his last three games and earned him a first Premiership start at this weekend, a far cry from his chastening first week at the club last January. “It was degrees in Argentina when I left. I came here and it was zero degrees. My hands were freezing; when I went to catch the ball in training I couldn’t do it. Every touch I had was a knock-on.” There was some more juvenile team-room sniggering this week when Cordero, not yet entirely fluent in English dressing-room speak, announced at the review of last Friday win at Newcastle that he “wanted to touch more balls”. Even when “Santi” says nothing some of his teammates make fun of his habit of drinking maté (a type of South American tea) at every possible opportunity. “They think I’m weird, I think they’re weird. The only one who drinks maté with me is [Italian international] Michele Campagnaro. We have a good chemistry. I’m trying to get all the boys to try it. Maybe they’ll like my culture!” On the field, happily, there is now greater empathy with the capped Puma. The Chiefs’ structured system does not always suit spur-of-the-moment individualism but Cordero now knows where he needs to be to have a greater impact. “I’m now understanding the way they think here. Everyone, from props to full-backs, knows where we’re going. Latin players are not so structured. I just want to catch the ball and find a way through. If a gap opens, just go for it. But it good for me … I’m expanding my mind. Super Rugby is very dynamic but they study more here. You need to be alert all the time, you can’t rest. Maybe last season because I was new I felt like they didn’t trust me Now I’m gaining in confidence and I can see their trust in me growing. I’ve only been here a few months but I already feel like one of them.” Given the rapid recent depreciation of the peso against the dollar and Argentina rampant inflation, which is expected to top this year, it grows ever harder to argue that players should be frozen out for heading abroad. Cordero father works in a bank and his mother drives a school bus: having married his wife, Bernadita, in June – his best man was the Puma winger Ramiro Moyano – he would like his European rugby adventure to continue. “Every rugby player wants to play for his country but it been a good decision. I would like to find a club where I can settle down, play regularly and be part of it. Hopefully it will be here.” Whether Exeter will extend his current one-year deal if European-based Pumas are ushered back into the World Cup picture remains to be seen. For now all Cordero can do is focus on his day job and see where it takes him. “I don’t think Argentina are going to call me but if there some miracle and they do I’ll always give for my country. Every time you watch the Pumas you want to be there. For me that would be amazing. But it part of life. My first responsibility is to give everything to the Chiefs. My head is here and I’m enjoying every single moment.”",905,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/28/santiago-cordero-exeter-chiefs
37,"The former Bath captain Stuart Hooper has been earmarked to replace Todd Blackadder as their director of rugby but not until at the earliest after the club confirmed the New Zealander contract extension.

When he goes, the plan is for the Hooper to replace him but the club chief executive, Tarquin McDonald, revealed Blackadder may yet extend his stay further. In a detailed outline of Bath future, McDonald also announced the long-serving first-team coaches Toby Booth and Darren Edwards will be leaving at the end of the season. Hooper scheduled step up, however, is part of the club strategy of seeking to promote from within. After serving as Bath captain for five seasons he retired two years ago with a back injury before taking on the role of performance and player development director. This season he has been promoted to general manager. McDonald said: “Why Stuart Hooper?

Roberts maintained he had a good working relationship with the Australian Cricketers’ Association CEO, Alistair Nicholson. Nicholson offered his congratulations and also highlighted the critical nature of Roberts’ role. “The partnership between the ACA and CA has been important to the game success for over years,” he said. “We look forward to continuing to build bridges between our organisations as we look to grow Australian cricket. “CA have identified a need for significant change and the ACA will play its part assisting CA and Kevin throughout this ongoing process.” Roberts has previous experience on the board of Cricket Australia and played first-class cricket for New South Wales.",302,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/03/kevin-roberts-appointed-new-ceo-of-cricket-australia
39,"Rory Burns, Surrey Left-handers seem to be given more licence by the gods, their sinister deals unknown to those of us who favour the right hand. Brian Lara and Shiv Chanderpaul had esoteric techniques and that before we get to Rory Burns’ recent teammate at the Oval, Graeme Smith. So maybe we should ditch discussion of the multiple moving parts Burns employs at the crease and watch the bat – and that, in an age when it is almost a sign of unorthodoxy, is straight. Burns finished the Championship season with more runs than his nearest rival in Division One – James Hildreth, another who deals in that hard currency, rather than potential, style, or the mysterious “michaelvaughaness” that is always cited if a player averaging thirtysomething is called up for the Test XI. When Surrey appointed Burns captain in Championship and cricket, there was a sense of a changing of the guard – Burns was a generation younger than his predecessor, Gareth Batty, but a generation (well, a cricketing generation) older than the bright young things coming through from the academy. Few could have predicted just how successful he would be in leading his charges – of course, it always a breeze when you’re winning, but there a happy confidence evident at The Oval these days, decent blokes playing more than decent cricket. Olly Stone, Warwickshire My father told me that if you want to know how fast a bowler is, don’t watch the ball, watch the batsman. I first saw Olly Stone playing white-ball cricket for Northamptonshire in a televised match and he didn’t look much at first glance. But you looked at the batsmen and they were twitching, half-ducking, half-jumping and nowhere near getting into line – there was a touch of the fear that is evident in those grainy clips of Harold Larwood, another speedster who looked anything but. This season, Stone has produced Larwoodesque numbers for Warwickshire – in seven matches, he has wickets at an average of and strike rate of OK, they are Division Two stats, but as anyone who watched the Ashes last winter can testify, if you can toss the ball to a bowler who can take wickets with velocity, you’re going to win cricket matches. Stone is an outlier and management cultures do not always deal well with outliers – Ed Smith knows a thing or two about that and must use the quickest bowler he can pick with due care and attention. Tom Bailey, Lancashire English cricket will always find room for a tall man who hits the seam hard and gets at the batsman. It an old adage, but “you miss, I hit” (more prosaically “you lose concentration, get greedy or give me less than a straight bat, I take your wicket”) is as good a tactic as any. It can take time for a bowler to learn that lesson – and that he should not apologise for it. In a relegated team, Tom Bailey delivered on one of cricket toughest job descriptions – bowling behind a fragile batting line-up. Lancashire first-innings scores in half their Championship matches – – do not give an opening bowler much to work with. His personal figures make for better reading. In Division One, only Simon Harmer bowled more than Bailey overs, few bettered his average of or his economy rate of – and nobody took more than his wickets. Players such as Bailey weave themselves into the culture of English first-class cricket and provide links to a past that sits in the institutional memory of the game, even of the nation. Just because such nebulous stuff can’t be monetised or turned into KPIs doesn’t make it any less valuable. Joe Denly, Kent What was it that turned the key in the lock and flared his talent flame again? I’d venture that his bowling has promoted a freedom in his batting, an example of two skills not working against each other to exhaust body and mind, but in harmony, the ball complementing the bat. Always useful, but with legspin increasing value in white-ball cricket where it can flummox even the sweetest timers of a cricket ball, Denly wrist spin has become a frontline option for his county – and his figures show just how effective a contributor he has become. In Kent run to the final of the Royal London One-Day Cup, Denly made nearly runs at at a tad under a run a ball; he also took wickets, also just under a run a ball. In the Blast, he notched over runs at a strike rate of and took wickets at an economy rate of well under eight an over. In Kent promotion season he topped the batting charts with runs and chipped in with wickets at That what you want from an ever-present senior pro across three formats and matches. Whether he can translate that output into the international game remains to be seen, but we can be sure that he will be ready if the nod comes. Lewis Gregory, Somerset Cricket provides its spectators with a range of pleasure: the slow burn of a low-scoring first-class match; the hopeless chase suddenly revived by the “big over”; the duel between a skilled bowler going through his variations while a batsman defends knowing his time will come, if only he is still at the crease. Is there a more watchable player than Somerset Lewis Gregory? In the Royal London One-Day Cup match at home to Middlesex, Gregory, captaining the side, came in with the score on in the over and left, four sixes later, with it with balls still available. Opening the bowling, he then knocked over Nick Gubbins and Eoin Morgan, Somerset running out comfortable winners. County cricket talking points: Surrey and Essex see out the season in style In the Blast (in which he scored over runs at a strike rate of over his off balls lifted Somerset to which proved too much for Nottinghamshire, limited to all out, Gregory again doing a decent job with off his full allocation. In a Division One match against Yorkshire that both sides needed to win, a pair of half-centuries (scored at a strike rate of twice took the game away from the bowling side and, when he had ball in hand, his match figures of ensured that there was no way back for the Tykes. Gregory is not (at a great player, but he is a player capable of great performances that win cricket matches and empty bars.

41,"oe Denly experienced an eight‑year gap between the last of white-ball caps and his recent call-up for England Test tour to Sri Lanka. By his own admission he went missing for too much of it. But now and revelling in a two-year purple patch that has seen him end the summer with a cheque for as county cricket most valuable player, this elegant Kent right-hander and self‑taught leg-spinner has a second chance to live out a dream that at one stage was detrimentally all‑encompassing. “I feel much better equipped and have a much better understanding, not just technically but also of the pressures that come with playing for England,” says Denly, who after a couple of ODI half-centuries in was dropped on the eve of the World the next year and seldom considered thereafter. “Before I was worried about what people thought of me and how I looked. The belief wasn’t quite there. When I got dropped by England, everything was about getting back in the team, putting a lot of pressure on myself. Jos Buttler transformation to genuine Test player is now complete | Barney Ronay “I went missing really for two or three years. Performances and my love of the game dropped quite a bit. It got to a point where I had to start enjoying it again because my career was almost fading away. Now I’m at ease with my game.” During this spell in the wilderness Denly upped sticks from Kent to Middlesex in search of a fresh start. But after three dry years at Lord, it was in fact the return to his home city of Canterbury in while making peace with his England ambitions, that led to him striking a rich and lasting vein of form. “In the past, if I didn’t score runs, I didn’t switch off from thinking about it, whereas now failure is part of the game. There always one with your name on but keep improving and always look on the positive side,” says Denly less than an hour after his season – in which Kent were promoted to Division One – ended, as if to illustrate his point, with a duck. That score was not indicative of the past months, with centuries flowing from his blade across the three formats, including nine in first-class cricket. The leg‑spin that removed South Africa Graeme Smith with his first ball in international cricket has matured, too, to the extent that he can be considered more than a part‑timer. Denly is a batsman first and foremost, however, and after hearing he was on the radar of Ed Smith, his former Kent teammate who is now the national selector, this one-time opener pushed himself back up a spot to No to get nearer to the new Dukes ball in a summer where others were trying desperately to get away from it. “When your name spoken around the circuit your ears prick up a bit and you begin to think it could happen,” says Denly. “I didn’t hear anything until the day I got picked but I’d had the odd text from Paul Farbrace [England assistant coach] to say congratulations on the runs I was scoring. I started at No this year as I was captaining and bowling, a bit like Joe Root. But then I thought I wouldn’t do myself any harm at No with the talk going around. In terms of where I see myself batting for England, to bat or would be amazing.” The retirement of Alastair Cook means Denly, Rory Burns, Keaton Jennings and Moeen Ali will now be vying for three spots in November three‑Test series. While the case for Burns was compelling, Denly slightly more left‑field inclusion has the finger prints of Smith all over it for two reasons. The first is Smith belief that some players require longer to blossom; not all talent is best hot-housed from a young age. Secondly Smith is putting greater stock in leagues as he looks to repeat some of the alchemy that led to Jos Buttler stunning Test return . Denly thrived in this regard last winter, bouncing from the Bangladesh Premier League into similarly positive stints in Australia Big Bash (where he has since been retained by the Sydney Sixers) and the Pakistan Super League. “If you’re not involved in international cricket and the pressures that come with that,” Denly says, “the next best thing is not only to perform on the county stage but to get your name in big competitions around the world. That been a massive thing for my confidence and belief – a great stepping stone into international cricket.” Relaxed, confident and still blessed with the athleticism that saw him play football for Charlton academy as a teenager, this late bloomer from the Garden of England now appears well placed to make up for lost time.",809,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/joe-denly-england-i-went-missing-for-two-or-three-years
42,"Australia won’t curb their attacking instincts and are unlikely to tinker with their batting line-up, despite a top order collapse in the first women match against New Zealand. Chasing at North Sydney Oval on Saturday, Australia crashed to in the sixth over. An unbroken fifth wicket stand of between captain Meg Lanning and her deputy Rachael Haynes powered them to a six-wicket win with balls to spare. The Guardian women cricketer of the year Sarah Taylor Beth Mooney and Ashleigh Gardner were both caught in the deep, as Australia came out with all bats blazing. Veterans Lanning and Haynes steadied the ship after coming in at five and six respectively and champion allrounder Ellyse Perry never even got to the crease. Haynes, who captained the side last summer when Lanning was injured, doubted whether either of them or Perry would be moved up the order. “No I think we’ll back our batting line-up, that probably one of our strengths, that we do bat quite deep in our order,” Haynes said. “But I think everyone who comes in, we want them to play with aggression and play with a really positive style and intent. “I think tonight was a bit of a blueprint of what we want to come.” Haynes on Saturday notched her highest international score. Asked if she as in the best form of her career, Haynes said “Yeah, I’m a lot more relaxed about the whole thing to be honest. “When I was younger I was a bit too intense and didn’t take the time to enjoy it and now when I play, i just want to enjoy it.” She described the efforts of spinner Sophie Molineux as outstanding after the young Victorian allrounder conceded just runs off her four overs. Haynes said Australia bowlers needed to tidy up their execution for Monday second match in Brisbane, especially after conceding runs off their last two overs on Saturday. New Zealand coach Haidee Tiffen was also looking for better execution from her bowlers, and for her batters to start their late innings charge earlier than they did on Saturday and have fewer dot balls. She will also look for highly rated teenage spinner Amelia Kerr to bounce back after conceding off two overs, the worst economy rate of her international career.",382,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/lanning-and-haynes-rescue-australia-in-first-t20-with-new-zealand
43,"he last day of the domestic cricket season fell on Thursday when Essex, the defending county champions, played out the final day of the final match against this year champions Surrey, at the Oval. The sky was gentlest blue, the leaves of the south London trees thinking about falling. Entry was free and though the hordes failed to storm the bastion, the plastic tip-up seats filled up well enough, comfortable pair of trousers by comfortable pair of trousers, for a last deep breath of late summer. The day was a thriller, one of the very best, but no one knew that for sure when they wandered into the ground at half past What they really came for was to say goodbye. County cricket talking points: Surrey and Essex see out the season in style Humans have an inbuilt desire to commemorate endings. It why we hold funerals. It why we sign the leaving card that passes round the office and why we hug our family extra tight when they fly home to the other side of the world, reunions promised, but the unspoken understanding that the future is unknown. Cricketers’ retirements, coming as they do in September, have a particularly poignant air – thank you and goodbye to all this, the rhythms of the season, the turning of the year. This autumn, more players than ever seem to have hung up their tired old boots for good. Jimmy Adams and Sean Ervine, longstanding teammates at Hampshire, have retired together; the former England off-spinner James Tredwell, whose chronic shoulder injury prevented him playing a first-team game this season, has said goodbye to Kent. Andy Hodd, wicketkeeper and qualified electrician, who once left a wall half-plastered after fielding an emergency call from Yorkshire, has gone. So, too, has Jack Shantry, who captured the imagination of so many and ended up with a game named after him. There are more. But three names in particular stand out. At Edgbaston, the faithful gathered to say goodbye to Jonathan Trott , born in Cape Town, who came over to Birmingham as a young man and settled here, marrying Abi, who used to work at the club and whose grandfather was the former club captain. Trott is a complicated character, a talented, popular, hard-working batsman, who carried the fear of failure heavily. The fresh-faced young man who scored a century on his Test debut had a dream career with England until stress and anxiety struck on the tumultuous tour of Australia and he left early. His international career never recovered. But he fought back, and with his adopted county was able to find fulfilment and, even at the last, runs – of them in this year Championship, with a couple of centuries thrown in for good measure. The Kent players formed a guard of honour for his last innings and on Wednesday, in front of his family, he walked off the field for the last time, with Warwickshire Division Two champions. Down at Chelmsford, James Foster, the only man to stump Sachin Tendulkar in a Test match, hung up his wicketkeeping gloves after years. Despite a stellar career with the club the farewells this time were not quite as happy – Foster wanted to continue playing, Essex wanted to look to the future. But he was there at the Oval as Essex squeezed past Surrey, bearded now, but still with the same enthusiasm. After making his Test debut aged on England tour of India that fell the winter after the attack on the twin towers, he played seven Tests and ODIs for England – a man born out of his time, his specialist skills belonging to an era when glove men were not expected to be hulking great big bashers of runs. He is moving into coaching now, in demand from the new world of franchises, but after such a long time there is regret as well as excitement. “It feels weird that I’m no longer going to be a professional cricketer,” he said, “and it feels weird I won’t be driving to Chelmsford for work or any sort of affiliation with the club.” Finally, to the Riverside, where next season there will be a huge hole marked Paul Collingwood . He never claimed to be the most outrageously talented but, with a strawberry-blond smile, drew the very last drop out of his ability with bat, ball and in the field. He achieved nearly everything as a cricketer, even retiring from England at the right time. Internationally, he was part of three Ashes-winning sides and captained England side to the World Cup final, hitting the winning runs in – still the only World Cup trophy for the men team. But it was at Durham where he was most loved, a fixture for more than years, loyal through thick and thin – from the County Championship win in to the financial struggles and relegation that followed. Fabulous careers all, if not always the fairytales they believed in as young men: life can be a cruel mistress. Retirement for sportspeople is hard – go well, out into the world where cricket is not everything, where it often means very little, but new doors are waiting to be pushed.",870,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/29/paul-collingwood-cricket-exodus-end-of-season
44,"The Guardian Women Cricketer of the Year is an award given to a player who has done something truly remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. Sarah Taylor is the inaugural winner On November last year the two things Sarah Taylor knew were that she did not want to be where she was, and that she could not bring herself to go anywhere else. Two days earlier, England had lost a match to Australia in Sydney. The defeat meant England could not win the Ashes. After it, Taylor thoughts drifted. She started to worry about the long flight home later that week. Taylor tries to avoid aeroplanes. It is not a phobia – she likes flight, even enjoys the turbulence – it is that once the plane is up, there is no way off. And she is someone who needs to know she can make a quick getaway. That is why she decided to drive to the next match in Canberra, when everyone else flew. The journey was supposed to take three hours but seemed to go on so long she was utterly exhausted by the time she arrived. There was no time to recover because England had to play again the very next day. The panic started when she got to the ground. “It hard to explain,” she says. “Sometimes I tell people it like when you’re hungover, you feel really dehydrated, and like someone sitting on your head. Sometimes you’re in a crowd and you just feel like everyone on top of you, and you start to feel warm, and you just completely lose control. Anxiety is about losing control of your own thoughts.” I’ve had games where I was sick because I was so nervous ... I hated cricket for such a long time Always though, her breathing goes. It turns shallow and she starts to feel faint. “It completely irrational at the time, and you know it irrational, but you can’t change it.” She was not sure she could play that day. Then she saw her teammate, Tammy Beaumont, put on a pair of wicketkeeping gloves and start to warm up and something in her snapped. “As soon as I saw that I was like: ‘Nah, I’m not having that, I need to get my gloves on.’” She told England coach, Mark Robinson: “We need to get me through this.” So Taylor played. Between every over, her teammates fed her sweets to help her control her breathing, and put an iced towel around her neck to cool her down. The Guardian footballer of the year Juan Mata Half an hour into Australia innings, England quick Katherine Brunt was bowling, and Taylor was standing up to the stumps behind Elyse Villani, Australia No Villani stepped from her crease, swung her bat across the line and missed the ball. Taylor caught it, Villani stretched her foot back towards the crease, and in that split-second Taylor broke the bails. Villani was out for one run, stumped. It was a brilliant dismissal any time, let alone by a keeper fighting off a panic attack and feeling as if they might faint any minute. Brunt did not celebrate with Taylor but folded her into a hug and whispered, “Well done”. England won by runs. “Weirdly enough, I think actually playing that day did me more good than sitting in the changing room worrying,” Taylor says now. “Sometimes cricket is the trigger but then sometimes it my comfort zone, too.” Sport can be both the cause and the cure. Not that Taylor ever expects to be entirely rid of her illness, just that she hopes to learn to cope with it. “I think I will always have it to be honest, I think it is just an ongoing battle. But I’m not ashamed of it. I’m still a good person, I can still have a laugh. And I still can’t accept compliments or awards.” Which is unlucky, because she gets a lot of both. This is another. Taylor is the first winner of the Guardian new women cricketer of the year award, because of her batting and keeping, of course, and also the work she has done to raise awareness about mental illness. This year she was a key part of the England team who won two one-day series and a tri-series against New Zealand and South Africa, of the Sussex team who won promotion to the county championship first division, and the Surrey team who won the Kia Super League. Her keeping has become so good that Adam Gilchrist, who may well keep in the all-time team to play Mars, says that right now she is the “best in the world – male or female” . A ridiculous amount of people deal with anxiety. I wanted to let people know it was OK just to talk about it On Friday it was announced that she will miss the World in the West Indies later this year as she continues to manage her anxiety, a mutual decision taken by Taylor and England management team. When Taylor talks about her year so far, the word she uses most is “unscathed”. She is happy she came through it. Taylor is and says a bad year might have pushed her into retirement. It is not difficult to see why she has therefore decided to skip the tournament in the West Indies. There have been low moments along the way. When England broke the world record score, Taylor watched as her teammates blazed from the first balls for the opening wicket. “I was like: ‘I can’t do that’ and all of a sudden you doubt yourself, your anxiety kicks in and then you go into panic mode. The last thing I wanted to do was go out there and bat.” She did not. England sent Nat Sciver in instead. “And then you breathe out in relief.” Taylor has suffered like this for a long time. Only when it first started, she did not know what it was, and the team, even the sport, was not set up to provide her with the necessary support. “I’ve had games where I was sick because I was so nervous. And I thought it was normal. I thought: ‘Everyone goes through this.’ But actually I was having a panic attack.” She started to blame the game. “I thought: ‘Cricket done this to me, I don’t have this in my normal life, I hate cricket.’ And I did. I hated cricket for such a long time.” She tried to tell people about it but she did not have the words and they did not have the understanding. “There was almost a stigma, it was a case of ‘brush it off, you’re fine.’ It was a sign of weakness to say anything.” She does not blame anyone, “because at the time if someone had said that to me I would have been like: ‘It all right, just go have a good night sleep.’ But I like to think that now it would be dealt with a lot better.” It would. She says Robinson has been “unbelievable”. He maps out her season, looking for stress points like long trips between back-to-back matches, and tells her that when she is struggling he will be happy if she can simply get into her kit and out on to the field, let alone score any runs. Steve Harmison: ‘I didn’t want the public to know about my depression’ Taylor does not say it but she has helped push through that change too, by talking so honestly about her illness. In her lowest moment, when she took an indefinite break from the game in she decided she wanted to give an interview to the BBC to explain what was going on. “I think initially England said I had ‘personal issues’ and I wasn’t happy with that. I didn’t want people second-guessing me. So I said: ‘No, look, this is what going on.’ I’m not ashamed of it and I never have been. There a ridiculous amount of the population that suffers from it. And I wanted to let people know that it was OK to just talk about it.” Eighteen months later, Taylor teammate and friend Kate Cross felt able to speak about her own depression and anxiety too – how it had been so bad that she had spent three days in bed, crying to herself before England tour of the West Indies. “We were best mates for years but we never told each other,” Taylor says. “But I guess we didn’t know what it was at the time.” Now the team is a lot more open. “There a handful of girls who will say they have suffered with something, or they feel like they might be.” Taylor worries that in the lower levels of the sport, around the counties, players are not getting the support they need and that they will not until the women game has turned professional. As we finish talking, a shy young boy in a Middlesex kit comes up to ask for Taylor autograph. This happens a lot these days. “I even get the dads coming up to me saying: ‘Can you sign my gloves?’ I think that just shows where the women game has gone.” But the fans she really treasures are not always the ones who want to talk cricket. “I had one girl get in touch this summer. She suffers from anxiety as well. I think she from Essex, and she got a train all the way to Guildford to come and watch me play for Surrey, and it was, I think, one of the hardest things she done. So if people say to me: ‘What did I win this summer?’ Well I got a message from her and a card at the end of the season. That what I won.”",1653,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/28/sarah-taylor-guardian-womens-cricketer-of-the-year-2018
45,"Ball one: Surrey, on top, go down fighting With the last ball of the last day of the last match still standing in the County Champions could win, tie or lose to their predecessors – and they say this form of the game is outdated? Spoilsport, Ryan ten Doeschate, scored the runs that won a remarkable match, runs that denied Surrey an unbeaten season and a fairytale victory. Bowled out in a blaze of end of term carelessness for in the first dig, Surrey went in to bat for a second time trailing by runs. overs later, Essex were chasing an awkward for a win that had looked nailed on for two days. But you don’t win out of matches without spirit as well as skill, and it took a captain knock for Ten Doeschate to deny Surrey , who would not be bowed without a struggle to the bitter end. Great match, great season, great competition. Ball two: Bailey fails to bail out Lancashire It was too little (but only just) too late for Lancashire, who were relegated to Division Two by one point, Nottinghamshire having squeezed the two they needed out of a rampant Somerset side. That said, Nottinghamshire won four matches to Lancashire three, so there can be few complaints from Old Trafford, only a list of what might have been – but cricket, like life, is never short of those once you go looking. This match was another personal triumph for Tom Bailey, whose four wickets in each innings saw him finish the season as the leading wicket-taker in Division One with scalps at Quite what he and Graham Onions wickets at in matches) think of their batsmen might not be printable. It amazing to think that they took of available wickets between them – and their team still went down. Ball three: Nottinghamshire suffer twin hat-tricks against Somerset Nottinghamshire were almost caught wearing their flip-flops prematurely, as Somerset hammered them by an innings and runs in a match that saw two hat-tricks, one for all-rounder (yes, I’m calling it) Tom Abell and one for Craig Overton. Or should that be Marcus Trescothick, who caught Ben Slater, Samit Patel and Riki Wessels at second slip? That a fine way to celebrate a one year contract extension that will take him to into Brian Close territory down Taunton way. Somerset finish the season as runners-up – somewhere, I think I’ve read that before. Ball four: Brooks leaves Yorkshire in style Speaking of “all-rounders”, Jack Brooks carried his sweaty headband from the Yorkshire dressing room for the last time, signing off with in Worcestershire first innings and when he got a bat in his hand. With Ben Coad and Gary Ballance also enjoying a fine match, the Tykes’ win took them to fourth place in the table, but everyone knows the White Rose could easily have suffered the Red Rose fate had the dice fallen slightly differently. Worcestershire will play in Division Two in but that been expected for a while now – it usually is when a team perhaps best suited to Division play in the top flight. Ask Daryl Mitchell – a fine cricketer, but a man with the unenviable (and undeserved) record of five relegations on his CV. Ball five: Bears climb to top of the tree Warwickshire handed Jonathan Trott the Division Two title as a leaving present after their sorta play-off against Kent turned into a procession. When in-form openers, Will Rhodes and Dom Sibley, took the Bears past Kent first innings total of the jig was up for Sam Billings’ men, who can nevertheless look back on a fine season that saw them promoted to Division One and play in a Lord final. And, speaking of looking back with pleasure, the same applies to Jonathan Trott, one of many cricketers taking their leave this week with the thanks and genuine affection of their counties’ supporters and cricket fans everywhere. Ball six: Paul Collingwood leaves with love Which brings us to perhaps the fondest farewell of all. Paul Collingwood OBE (yes, OBE) played his final match for Durham, its most noblest servant bowing out with a defeat at the hands of Middlesex , who shot out the man from Shotley Bridge team for when would have been enough for a valedictory victory. So the man whose first innings in Championship cricket was terminated on by the late Kevin Curran (Sam and Tom dad) walks away into the weakening North East sun, the strawberry blond hair fading a little to grey, the applause ringing in his ears.

46,"Adil Rashid has been rewarded for his performances over the summer with a Test central contract from England, with Jos Buttler and Sam Curran also included among players on the red-ball list but no opening batsman. The leg spinner – who signed a new all-format contract with Yorkshire this month having previously played as a white-ball specialist – played in all five Tests in the victory over India but was used sparingly by captain Joe Root in a series dominated by seam. Yet with the expected to play a major role in Sri Lanka in the forthcoming series alongside fellow spinners Moeen Ali and Jack Leach, Rashid is one of seven players to be handed contracts covering both Test and white-ball cricket with Root, Buttler, Moeen, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes. However, following the decision of the former England captain Alastair Cook to retire from international cricket after the Test series against India, there is a big vacancy at the top of the order which needs to be filled. Cook latest opening partner Keaton Jennings, the Lancashire batsman, misses out on a deal, while Rory Burns had pressed his case when scoring more than runs in the County Championship to help Surrey win a first title in years. Essex beat Surrey by one wicket to head off world record attempt – as it happened England have split their annual deals into red- and white-ball cricket since the end of the season, the former continuing as straight replacements for county contracts and the latter paying salaries to short-form players on top of their domestic arrangements. Surrey all-rounder Curran, who was named player of the series against India after match-changing half-centuries at Edgbaston and the Ageas Bowl and wickets via his left-arm swing, is also included for the first time. That means England gain greater control over his workload and will have a say in whether he is to be made available for next year IPL, amid rising interest from a number of franchises including Virat Kohli Royal Challengers Bangalore. Meanwhile, Curran older brother Tom, who also plays for Surrey, has been awarded an incremental contract for the next months, while Liam Plunkett, Jason Roy and David Willey are among those to be retained on the white-ball list.

47,"What thrills! What spectacle! On the last day of the season, there was only one match still standing – between the new champions and the old at the Kia Oval – one last hurrah before the nights grow long and the grass shrivels back to its winter rest. And it had it all, won by Essex with a brushed four, with only one wicket left. Skill, high tension and occasional farce was punctuated at the end by an air of mystery when the ECB chairman, Colin Graves, failed to present the Championship trophy, despite being in the county chairmen meeting just the other side of the ground. The meeting, said the ECB, took precedence, which was a shame, as it was a day to publicly celebrate all that was good about the game. With free entry Surrey started their advance on what would have been a record-breaking win, adding to their overnight score, to finish a mere runs more than their disastrous first innings. Rikki Clarke notched up a quick with one more heave of the old body, and there were five wickets for Matt Coles, who only came into the match midway through as a concussion substitute for Sam Cook. To win, Essex had to score – runs more than the that Morne Morkel had requested from his batsmen in the dressing room on Wednesday evening. After lunch the Surrey captain, Rory Burns, threw the ball to Morkel. There would be no quarter given, that much was clear when he turned at the top of his run and high-stepped in, all purring Ferrari, hands low ready for the heist. He struck in his second over, Murali Vijay stumps splattered for two. Amar Virdi and Jade Dernbach followed with two wickets apiece, three catches snaffled by Rikki Clarke at slip, and at for five Essex were in trouble. But the captain, Ryan ten Doeschate, and Adam Wheater hustled through the fire with a partnership of Morkel had not finished. Steam up, he came back for his second spell. Wheater and Harmer were dispatched in the same over, then Porter lbw with needed. Tea was postponed and when Matt Coles was run-out after a mix-up with Ten Doeschate with only eight needed and one wicket to take, all seemed lost. But somehow, despite some chaotic running, despite last man Matthew Quinn being hit on the helmet by -Morkel, Essex did it, the winning runs hit by Ten Doeschate, in one of the pluckiest innings of the season. The players embraced on the pitch and Ten Doeschate called his Essex team down to applaud the Surrey players up the pavilion steps. Burns, who had won nearly every award going at the Surrey Awards Night, was magnanimous in their only defeat of the year: “As an advert for the game and the County Championship, it was everything that it needed to be,” he said. “Even in not winning this game we’ve shown what we’re about.” And with that the season was gone. That really is it everyone - thank you for a wonderful season. Onward to the next!

49,"Mitch Marsh and Josh Hazlewood will share Test vice-captaincy duties after Australia rejigged its traditional leadership model in response to the Cape Town cheating scandal. David Warner was stripped of his title and barred from ever holding a leadership post as part of the sanctions Cricket Australia (CA) handed down six months ago in South Africa. Marsh, who captains Western Australia and led Australia A earlier this month, was always considered the frontrunner in the leadership race to be skipper Tim Paine understudy. David Warner starts slow rebuild with instant coffee and a rapid hundred But the governing body sprung something of a surprise on Thursday, with the allrounder and paceman Hazlewood both appointed vice-captains. “We believe the new leadership model will best support the captain. It is a successful model used across various sporting codes around the world,” chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said. “We see it benefiting the group. Not just from a tactical perspective but also to help drive the team values and standards on and off the field.” The appointment of Marsh and Hazlewood came after a player vote and formal interview, both of which were unprecedented measures from CA. Hazlewood and Marsh presented to a panel that consisted of selectors Hohns and Greg Chappell, CA chairman David Peever, CA board member Mark Taylor, coach Justin Langer, team psychologist Michael Lloyd and CA high-performance boss Pat Howard. The new process reflected CA desperation to improve team culture in the aftermath of the ball-tampering saga. The rethink was also caused by the fact the Test vice-captaincy has previously come with the unofficial title of captain-in-waiting, creating unwanted friction between leaders and few seamless successions. “It was not a process designed to find the next Australian Test captain but to find two vice-captains who will support and help drive the team goals and objectives,” Hohns said. “Josh and Mitch display great leadership qualities and we were extremely impressed by their passion and energy.” Marsh vowed he and Hazlewood would do everything they can to make Paine life easier. “I’ve certainly grown as a leader in the last months for Western Australia. I’ve found out a lot about myself, about leadership,” Marsh said. “Hopefully I’ll be able to instil that on young guys coming through, what it is to be an Australian cricketer and what we stand for going forward.” Hazlewood will miss the Test series against Pakistan, which starts on October in Dubai, because of a back injury.",410,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/27/marsh-and-hazlewood-appointed-australian-test-joint-vice-captains

There was early resistance from Zak Crawley and Sam Billings but Olly Stone three for and a direct-hit run-out of Harry Podmore finished the match.

This is in from the MCC: “The duo have been recognised for their selfless and sporting actions during England LD tour of the Netherlands earlier this summer. England LD had been defeated by Netherlands and Yorkshire before facing Denmark in the final of three matches in three days. After being bowled out for Denmark had reached for when seamer Alex Jervis thought he had found the edge and after a huge appeal, the umpire raised his finger and it appeared that England had won the match. However, two England players were absent from the celebrations as Bowser, from his position at slip, had informed his captain, Edwards, that the batsman had hit the ground rather than the ball. Edwards decided to withdraw the appeal and play subsequently restarted. Denmark added four more runs and it looked like England had missed out on victory, however Jervis found the edge again – unmistakably this time – and England won the match by three runs. Mark Costin, England LD Assistant Coach, said: “I would go so far to say that it is the best thing I have ever seen on a cricket field and I certainly have never seen such a courageous sporting gesture. “Dan and Chris deserve the very highest recognition for what they did in that moment, under pressure with an international victory on the line, and for them to receive the CMJ Award is fantastic news.” The Previous winners of the award since its inception are: Wayne Madsen of Derbyshire; Sussex Luke Wright; Brendon McCullum for his sporting conduct as captain of New Zealand; Tom Fell of Worcestershire; and England Anya Shrubsole, who claimed the award last year for her sporting actions in the ICC Women World Cup Semi-Final against South Africa. of Newest Oldest Cricket County cricket live blog Warwickshire Surrey Essex County Championship Division One County Championship Division Two",2181,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/sep/26/county-cricket-surrey-v-essex-notts-v-somerset-and-more-live

54,"Ball one: Clarke signs on the dotted line Worcestershire relegation – as much expected as their Cup win last week was unexpected – was sealed with an abject defeat by champions Essex. It was the Jamie Porter-Simon Harmer double act (that did so much in that glorious season) making the difference, as Porter picked up wickets and Harmer five, the Worcestershire batting failing twice, the margin an innings and runs. News that Joe Clarke, top scorer in both innings in this match, a local(ish) lad and leading run-getter for the club in both the Championship and the Cup, is off to Nottinghamshire for will hardly help the county cause. If the salary cap allows Nottinghamshire to sign all these players (Ben Duckett, Ben Slater and Zak Chappell have also recently gone to Trent Bridge) perhaps its operation needs a review?

One of the joys of football, back before it all got grimly tribal and the impact of luck was minimised by armies of substitutes, was the chance of seeing an outfield player don an ill-fitting green jersey, oversized gloves and step between the posts, the named goalkeeper having gone off injured. Such was the scene comic potential that one didn’t even mind it if it were one own team so afflicted. But a substitute wicketkeeper favours tragedy over comedy, and so it proved at Headingley, where Aneurin Donald, the new boy presumably handed the gloves and told to get on with it as the senior pros stared at their feet, had a torrid time after replacing Tom Alsop. Ball three: Glamorgan can’t cope with Kent It must have particularly pleasing for Kent, on the brink of promotion, to see the Glamorgan team coach pull into the car park, knowing that the conveyance usually brings plenty of points as well as cricketers.

It’ll be different next year, but Kent fans can enjoy a title decider this week knowing that the season objective is already in the bag. Ball four: Trott off, so young batsmen must raise a gallop That de facto play-off comes courtesy of a draw against Sussex at Hove, in which Warwickshire top order distinguished themselves with a barrage of runs. closing their second innings on having been at one point in the first dig. How the Bears will go in Division One in may well depend on replacing the retiring Jonathan Trott reliable runs at and whether the old guard: Ian Bell Tim Ambrose Chris Wright and Jeetan Patel can support the younger players back in the top flight. It’ll be a big test for the likes of Dominic Sibley, Will Rhodes and Sam Hain, who have a bit to prove if they are to fulfil their considerable potential. Ball five: Thank God it wasn’t this week! The penultimate match of the Durham season got off to an unremarkable start. Foregoing the toss, Paul Collingwood invited the home side to bat and Leicestershire compiled all out, the top making double figures, but (perhaps ominously) nobody bettering Ateeq Javid In less than two sessions’ playing time, the match was done, the visitors dismissed for and both scores lower than their previous worst, that record now expunged from the books. As Mohammad Abbas had shown in the Lord Test back in May, if there a bit in it, the magic of Pakistani fingers and wrist can find it, his reward for his craft. But at least it wasn’t this week, the occasion of the valedictory match for Paul Collingwood, whose seasons at Durham have seen plenty of thick and thin and no little amount of blood. sweat and tears expended in the cause. He deserves the grandest of sendoffs on home territory against Middlesex – so let hope his batsmen have got the worst of their form out of their system and use their bats for more than just the thoroughly deserved honour guard Colly will undoubtedly receive.

At the changeover, with Stephens leading the two approached each other, with the American still unhappy about her opponent tactics. “That the sport we play. Right? Sportsmanship.

56,"Serena Williams does not understand why her coach admitted giving her instructions from the sidelines during her controversial US Open women final. Speaking about her outburst earlier this month, Williams maintained in an interview on Network Ten that she was not being coached during the match, which she lost to Japan Naomi Osaka. Serena Williams has to rise above stereotypes whether she right or wrong “I just don’t understand what [coach Patrick Mouratoglou] was talking about because I asked him, you weren’t coaching, we don’t have signals, we’ve never had signals and he said he made a motion,” she told the Sunday Project. “So you said you made a motion, now you told people that you’re coaching me. That doesn’t make sense, why would you say that?” Williams did not answer a question about whether she regretted the decision to break her racket on the court, with footage showing her publicist stepping in during the interview. The six-time US Open champion, who was chasing a record-equalling grand slam title, was handed a coaching violation and a point penalty for breaking her racquet before a heated argument with umpire Carlos Ramos ended with her losing a game. The tournament referee office fined the former world for the “verbal abuse” of Ramos, for being warned for coaching and for smashing her racket. Williams said she wanted to move on from the controversy. “What I’m just trying to do most of all is to just recover from that,” she told the Sunday Project.",250,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/24/serena-williams-says-she-doesnt-understand-coachs-claim-he-coached-her-at-us-open-final

If he were to get that far, Murray would regard it as progress after his second-round loss to Verdasco at the US Open , his first slam since Wimbledon last year. In a diluted reprise of his disappointing season – when he left the Tour after losing in the Wimbledon quarter-finals – Murray is in a marginally better place heading towards the Australian Open , which is his new priority. He added: “We are going to focus on some intense reconditioning [and] training blocks in the next couple of months with a view to being in the best possible shape for Australia in January. The last few months have been positive and, with the extra work over the coming months, I’ll be closer to playing at my highest level again.” The hip surgery he reluctantly underwent in Melbourne on the eve of this year Australian Open looks to have been a success, although he still moves with a noticeable limp.

He has a long way to go to return to the top of the game from a world ranking of but, with no points to defend, the opportunities for a quick rise are there.

58,"hen Forbes released their list of the highest-paid athletes, it came as a shock to many that not a single woman made the lineup . Not even Serena Williams, who is in the headlines even when she not playing. Many of the male athletes on the list did not top the list because of how much they earn on the field or court: their riches stem from how much they make in endorsements. If you follow women sports closely, it been clear for a long time that female athletes’ endorsements are nowhere near those of their male counterparts. Huge contracts with the likes of Nike or Adidas don’t tend to happen, apart from rare exceptions such as Michelle Wie and Maria Sharapova . Naomi Osaka beats the boos and begins long road to tennis icon status | Paul MacInnes Corporations, like the media, can set the tone for which athletes get exposure. So if companies don’t give female athletes lucrative endorsements, put them in commercials, or use them for print ads, the male stars will continue to gobble up revenue – even if the women have had more success. If you want an example of this, compare the earnings of the world champion US women soccer team to their male counterparts . So a few days ago when I scrolled through my Twitter feed to see Naomi Osaka name trending after she signed an annual deal with Adidas , I was elated. In addition, the new US Open champion also signed a three-year deal with Japanese carmaker Nissan. Before we address Osaka gender, it should be noted that Adidas and Nissan both have an eye on the Japanese market, after the became the first Japanese player to win a grand slam singles title (and it should also be noted that endorsements for the country top male player, Kei Nishikori, dwarf those of Osaka ). But by making a long-term investment in Osaka, Adidas started a conversation about the value of female athletes, and the monetary return companies can get from their investment in women in sports. After all, it makes economic sense. Currently, two out of five girls in the United States under the age of participate in youth sports, an industry worth almost . Then there the fact that of working women are sports fans. Undervaluing the influence of female athletes is short-sighted. Stars such as Williams, Sharapova and Alex Morgan have Twitter and Instagram followings in the millions. When they post, people pay attention. And female athletes can help open markets around the world, India grand slam doubles champion Sania Mirza has millions of followers on social media. The old lie that female athletes don’t pull in TV audiences is looking increasingly defunct too. During this year Winter Olympics, Team USA gold medal victory over Canada drew million viewers , making it the most watched late-night show in NBCSN history. This was in spite of the game airing at midnight. And of course there the US Women soccer team, who garnered million viewers in the US for the World Cup final against Japan. That was in comparison to baseball World Series from the year before, which attracted million for Game It was also the largest TV audience for any soccer match – men or women – in US history. Which brings us back to Osaka. Her US Open victory against Williams drew more viewers than the men final. Yes, it is fair to say that Williams drew a large portion of that audience because fans wanted to watch her claim a grand slam title less than a year after having her daughter, Alexis. But whatever the reason, it showed once again that female athletes can be a bigger draw than men.

60,"Umpire Mohamed Lahyani has been suspended from his next two scheduled tournaments for trying to encourage Nick Kyrgios during a match at the US Open. Lahyani took the unusual step of climbing down from his chair and having a lengthy chat with the Australian during the second-round match against Pierre-Hugues Herbert, when Kyrgios was showing little effort as he trailed by a set and down. The umpire was heard to say: “I want to help you. You are great for tennis. I know this is not you.” Umpire 'pep talk' row is just latest drama in the Nick Kyrgios soap opera Kyrgios went on to turn the match around to progress, with an annoyed Herbert claiming afterwards he felt Lahyani had overstepped the mark – sentiments also backed up by the likes of Roger Federer. US Open officials decided while Lahyani “went beyond protocol” in his actions, the umpire was allowed to continue in the chair for the rest of the tournament but stressed he should “adhere to proper protocols”. However, governing body ATP has now conducted its own internal review, and confirmed in a statement Lahyani, one of seven full-time umpires on the tour, had been suspended from the next two scheduled events – the China Open in Beijing and the Rolex Shanghai Masters. “Lahyani actions in the match were deemed to have compromised the impartiality that is required of an official. Lahyani will return to work at the Intrum Stockholm Open in October,” a statement read. “Despite the incident taking place at the US Open, under the jurisdiction of the United States Tennis Association, the incident was still subject to ATP disciplinary action due to Lahyani position as a full-time ATP employee and the high standards the ATP requires of its chair umpires regardless of the event to which he or she is assigned, in order to maintain the integrity of the tour.” ATP executive vice president of rules and competition Gayle David Bradshaw described Lahyani as a “world-class and highly-respected official”, but stressed “his actions during the match crossed a line that compromised his own impartiality as a chair umpire”. Bradshaw continued in a statement: “Although well-intended, his actions were regrettable and cannot go without disciplinary action on our own tour. “We know that he will learn from this experience and we look forward to welcoming him back in October.” Speaking at the time of the controversial incident at Flushing Meadows, Kyrgios – who has been penalised for a lack of best effort in the past – insisted the brief pep talk had little effect. “I’m not sure it was encouragement. He said he liked me. He just said that it not a good look,” the Australian said. “I wasn’t feeling good. I know what I was doing out there wasn’t good. I wasn’t really listening to him, but I knew it wasn’t a good look. It didn’t help me at all.” It was the first of two major incidents involving umpires at the US Open, with Serena Williams handed a game penalty after a tirade against match official Carlos Ramos in the women final.",518,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/19/umpire-suspended-for-helping-nick-kyrgios-at-us-open

Great Britain beat Uzbekistan in Davis Cup after Norrie makes up for meltdown The French Open finalist, who also ended Rafael Nadal unbeaten run on clay at the Madrid Open in May, delivered his nation an unassailable lead to ensure they will be seeded in February qualifying round for the new-look competition. Despite the defeat, De Minaur performance against one of the best players in the world on home soil and on his favoured surface is another positive sign in what been a magnificent for the world from Sydney. “Alex has proved he world class this year,” Thiem said. “At the US Open he played really good which was on a pretty slow hard court so I was not that surprised by how well he played today.” Having raced into a two-set lead, Thiem looked on course to wrap up a routine victory similar to his dismantling of Jordan Thompson in Friday opening rubber. But the resilient de Minaur took out the third set and then had two glorious opportunities to force the match to a decider after twice breaking Thiem serve. 'Devastated' Alex de Minaur defeated in five-set US Open epic by Marin Cilic But the Austrian broke back immediately on both occasions then saved his third break point of the set before holding his nerve to close out the win. “I think I was really close,” de Minaur said. “Being up a break in the fourth, I played not my greatest game and then I still had another break point at so I really thought I was points away from going to the fifth and then anything could have happened. “At the end of the day, I’ve just got to learn from these things. They do sting a lot but it a learning process for me and hopefully next time I’m in the same situation I don’t make the same mistake.” Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt said he was proud of how his undermanned team performed in the absence of Nick Kyrgios. “We came here to win, but we also came here to give and leave it all out here, and if we weren’t good enough, we weren’t good enough,” Hewitt said. “But I couldn’t be prouder of my team - the guys that played, the guys that didn’t play.

62,"This Davis Cup almost runneth over into a dead rubber on Sunday but sanity prevailed after Cameron Norrie had wrapped up the tie against Uzbekistan with a quick win against the late substitute Sanjar Fayziev, to ensure Great Britain will be seeded when the competition resumes in its new format in February. The convention once was that at least four sets of tennis should be played on the final day of a tie, to reward paying fans for their commitment, but, although there was audible disappointment in the stands when the announcement was made, there seemed little point in asking Dan Evans to play Jurabek Karimov in the fifth and redundant rubber after Norrie win. It lasted just under two hours. The air had properly gone out of the contest. Davis Cup: Austrian hero Thiem impressed by Aussie battler de Minaur The future is less certain. Great Britain might yet be awarded a wild card to join the current semi-finalists and other nations in the new end-of-season tournament in November next year, or be part of the qualifying rounds, home and away, in February. A competition that began as a challenge between Great Britain and the United States years ago is evolving again, with much less assurance than the forehand winners Norrie put on Fayziev on Sunday. Even without Andy Murray and Kyle Edmund the prospects for Leon Smith squad are promising. The opposition here brought few surprises but the home side did what was needed. Evans was brilliant in a winning comeback, Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot cleaned up in the doubles , the overall quality of tennis was high and the drama was considerable, especially on day one. “I’m really interested to see how they do it and their justification for who they give the wild cards to,” Smith said. “Clearly we’d be a strong candidate, based on the last three or four years in the competition, how we’ve hosted ties.” However, if Great Britain have to qualify, they will be hoping for another bonanza of excitement in Glasgow. It would be the Cup tie in Glasgow in years, just reward for a city that has done much to provide passion for the oldest annual international competition in sport. Davis Cup: Dan Evans wins on return but Cameron Norrie throws away lead The tie was all but nailed on the moment it was announced that Uzbekistan stand-out player, Denis Istomin, had hurt his ankle in his endeavours in the opening-day singles and Saturday doubles, and Fayziev would step up. He rarely plays singles and his ranking of is places below Norrie but he made a fight of it. While Karimov gave substance to Istomin pre-tournament truism that the Davis Cup often elevates players way above their rankings when he beat Norrie in five sets on Friday, it seemed unlikely Fayziev would do the same to a player determined to erase the embarrassment of that defeat. Norrie, born in South Africa, raised in New Zealand, nurtured on the college courts of the United States but committed to a career as a British player through his Scottish father and Welsh mother, has settled in quickly in his adopted country. He has a wry sense of humour and a solid game. He looks as if he will be a valuable servant for years to come. His father had flown the miles from Auckland – still with his “filthy Scottish accent” as Norrie fils said – to his native Glasgow, and left a happy man. Norrie, a hero on his debut against Spain in February, has developed a quick love for the team environment and the format. “It pretty lonely out there on the tour,” he said. “You’re by yourself or with just one coach all year round, then we come together as a team. It been a great week for us. It been so social, everyone getting on with everyone. We’ve had so many good laughs. It does mean a lot to get together and have these big ties, home ties.”",670,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/16/great-britain-beat-uzbekistan-davis-cup

Still, the went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this week unable to avoid the fury that erupted off court following her stunning US Open victory over Serena Williams. Who&nbsp;could? “In my mind, I wanted to know what was going on,” she said, of the moment Williams demanded an apology from the umpire Carlos Ramos. “I couldn’t hear and I was looking away, I really wanted to turn around but I didn’t.” If you strip away the technicalities of the situation – the actual tennis, say – the discussion of what happened at the final of the US Open has ignited the tennis hardcore, the fair‑weather fans and those merrily ignorant of the sport altogether. Whether Williams was right or wrong in being upset at what she considered unfair calls has almost – almost – become by the by. Whether she was penalised differently or more harshly because she is a woman, a dark-skinned black woman, has polarised the coverage further. The Serena cartoon debate: calling out racism is not ‘censorship’ | Gary Younge It is faintly ridiculous to pretend that Serena Williams hasn’t suffered prejudice both on and off court throughout her career; it is well established that the number of bad and erroneous calls made against her was one of the primary reasons Hawk-Eye cameras were introduced to the game. The crudely racist depiction of her by an Australian cartoonist this past week – and it is racist, let us count the many ways in a moment – has been a standard she has endured since she turned professional at Williams is the best and worst example there is of the concept of “misogynoir”. This is the term, coined by the academic Moya Bailey, used to define the way in which the double blow of racism and sexism intersect and damage. As a portmanteau, it may have the whiff of a terribly named cabaret show, but misogynoir is a deeply bleak reality. It exists both within black and brown communities as well as outside them and is a specific and unique form of prejudice experienced by black women and dark-skinned black women&nbsp;especially. Think of the way black women are represented, for one, in popular culture. The stereotypes, the crass and embarrassing gifs and memes shared online: the angry black woman, the sassy best friend, the hypersexualised booty. Look at that cartoon of Serena Williams again and consider how her rows on court are characterised as epic, aggressive meltdowns and how John McEnroe have become cute. It is an uncomfortable truth, but it is simply unacceptable to turn away, to block it out and ignore it. News Corp defiant after 'racist' Serena Williams cartoon sparks global furore At Serena Williams is the greatest athlete of all time, which isn’t even an opinion any more rather than a statement of fact. Her magnificence isn’t simply witnessed in the grand slam wins (including one while pregnant) but in the way she often makes it look easy. In grace, strength and beauty with a racket, she peerless. But this comes in spite of the way she is treated and perceived, not because it a fair&nbsp;game. Williams may be preternaturally gifted but she has put in relentless hours to become the pinnacle of black excellence. Anecdotes about hers and Venus childhood in Compton are well documented – the sisters were raised to never take anything for granted. Famously, their father, Richard, would bring in “bus-loads of kids” from different schools to surround the courts his daughters practised on and cuss them out, do their worst, use the N-word, simply to build their resilience. This may be at the extreme end of classic brown parenting but it did mean the Williams sisters knew they had to work much harder than their white, blonde peers in the game to&nbsp;survive. Serena Williams and Carlos Ramos to be kept apart at Australian Open And so the cartoon proves. Defenders of this peculiar form of so-called satire have been vitriolic about the response to the Herald Sun . Why can’t you stop making a thing of everything, comes the outrage to the outrage. Does everything have to be about identity politics, comes the eye-roll. Well, one would love to not have to point it out all the time, except an actual newspaper deemed it fit to publish a drawing of a grotesquely offensive Sambo caricature lifted from Jim Crow and have the nerve to call it Serena Williams. To hammer home the point, your average nice white blonde lady was drawn in as her opponent slash victim. This despite the fact, of course, that Naomi Osaka is a Haitian-Japanese woman of colour and Serena Williams is her&nbsp;hero. “What did she say to you?” Ellen DeGeneres asked Osaka, of her moment with Williams after the match. “What do you think she said?” quipped Osaka. Male players losing in similar situations – McEnroe, Andre Agassi – have often been presented to us as passionate, determined, outspoken. The narrative online has shaped Williams as an aggressive, hysterical, ranting nightmare. The truth, Osaka told DeGeneres, was: “She said that she was proud of me and that I should know the crowd wasn’t booing at me.” Williams may have lost it, she may have endured far more criticism and racism and sexism than most in her career, but her grace and dignity&nbsp;win.",926,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/16/serena-williams-stereotypes
64,"Great Britain, still living on the vapours of their Davis Cup triumph, are one win from securing a precious seeding in the qualifying rounds of the revamped tournament after Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot fell over the line in the doubles against Uzbekistan here in Glasgow. It took them just under three hours to crack the resistance of the estimable veteran Denis Istomin – backing up after losing to Dan Evans in four hours and minutes on Friday – and the world No Sanjar Fayziev, USA fall behind Croatia in Davis Cup as US Open umpire Carlos Ramos returns Cameron Norrie plays Istomin in the first reverse singles on Sunday and Evans faces Jurabek Karimov, who took three hours and minutes to upset Norrie on day one. That is a form line that oozes uncertainty. Istomin, will be exhausted but has given sterling service to his country with wins over years. The Great Britain captain, Leon Smith, said: “I’ve got a lot of respect for Denis coming out and playing doubles today; backing up tomorrow won’t be easy. That the great thing about having a specialist doubles team.” However, to lose from up against Uzbekistan, who took Switzerland to a fifth rubber two years ago in the most recent of nine consecutive losses in play-off finals, would represent a major setback for Great Britain – especially in the absence of Andy Murray and Kyle Edmund, the former still patching up his injured hip, the latter opting to prepare for next week Laver Cup in Chicago. The crowd at the Emirates Stadium looked to have swelled to respectability after thin presence on day one, which stretched into the late evening with two long, tense five-setters. The tension lingered on day two and Murray said: “We were so close to being two sets down but played really well the last two sets.” Davis Cup: Dan Evans wins on return but Cameron Norrie throws away lead As for his brother video message at the start of the tie, when he regretted not being able to play in what he feared might be the last Davis Cup match in Glasgow, Murray said: “It still going to be home and away in February and we could be back here one more time. So, you shouldn’t listen to everything Andy says. The team love coming back here. It our only chance to play world-class tennis in Scotland.” As Inglot correctly said: “There nowhere in Britain that has this much energy.” But it could have gone horribly wrong on Saturday. Murray was broken early and he came under pressure with ball in hand for much of the first couple of sets. Inglot big serve was as solid as a rock most of the time as they slowly re-established coherent patterns of court geography after a long time apart. Inglot finished the job on a second match point when he forced a final, weary response on the baseline from Fayziev.",492,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/15/jamie-murray-dominic-inglot-gb-davis-cup-uzbekistan
65,"Serena Williams and Carlos Ramos, the umpire whom she accused of sexism in the wake of the US Open final last Saturday, are likely to be kept apart at the Australian Open. But the decision will be made for reasons of common sense, rather than because of any specific demands from the grand slam champion. Give Serena Williams a break – us working mothers know what she up against In the her outburst during the final against Naomi Osaka , who went on to win the title, Williams called Ramos a thief and a liar and told him: “You will never do another one of my matches.” Ramos is employed by the International Tennis Federation and does not work on the WTA Tour, so the first chance he and Serena would have to meet again would be in Melbourne in January. Given what happened at Flushing Meadows, when it comes to assigning officials to Williams matches, discretion is likely to be the better part of valour. Tennis Australia, which runs the Australian Open , would not be drawn on what it would do should Williams officially request Ramos not umpire any of her matches and the Williams camp did not respond when asked if she will make such a request. But Richard Ings, a former professional umpire, said umpires will usually take the lead when it comes to managing awkward situations. “Say an umpire has a tough match with a player,” he told the Observer . “The player is angry, blames the umpire, says ‘you will never work a match again’. It is obvious that if the umpire does that player in the next match or next week that there will be a problem. So the umpire will simply take a break from umpiring that player. “When the pro umpire arrives at a tournament they update the supervisor if there are any players they are having a break from. May be none or one or two, whatever. And the supervisor schedules other qualified umpires that week for those matches.” In the final against Osaka, Williams was warned for coaching after Patrick Mouratoglou, was seen making hand signals in her direction. Williams angrily denied she would ever cheat. When she was docked a point for smashing her racket a few games later, she berated the umpire and accused him of being a thief because he “stole a point”. Ramos then penalised her a game for verbal&nbsp;abuse. On-court coaching – where a coach can come on to court once per set – is allowed on the WTA Tour but not at the grand slams. Coaching from the stands is banned at all times but many, including Billie Jean King, have suggested that coaching should be allowed because it happens all the&nbsp;time.",459,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/15/serena-williams-avoids-carlos-ramos-in-melbourne
66,"Six times in nine Davis Cup ties over years in Glasgow the crowds have flocked to acclaim the deeds of their own tennis knight, Andy Murray. In his absence from what will almost certainly be the last Cup fixture in the city of his birth in a long time they reserved their appreciation for the triumph of Dan Evans on his return from an enforced sabbatical, then were stunned by the five-set defeat of Cameron Norrie, a still unfamiliar son of a Glaswegian emigre. “I’m very proud to represent my country and win,” Evans said after a gruelling win over Denis Istomin in four hours and minutes, the perfect start to Great Britain World Group play-off against Uzbekistan on Friday. USA fall behind Croatia in Davis Cup as US Open umpire Carlos Ramos returns Norrie, the team world and active player, whose father arrived from New Zealand two days previously, had an altogether trickier time against the world No Jurabek Karimov, who recovered from two sets and a break down in the third, saving match point in the tiebreak, to win As the Uzbek shed his early serving nerves, he began to hit with abandon and wit. Norrie, meanwhile, did not faintly resemble the player who announced his arrival in Davis Cup in February by coming from two sets down to beat the clay specialist Roberto Bautista Agut in Spain. Norrie was candid in defeat. “Honestly, at the end of day, he played too good. All credit to him. It was tough for me to find a clear way to win. I competed as hard as I could and couldn’t ask any more of myself. I’ll try to forget that as soon as possible but it hurts a lot because I’m not just playing for myself, I’m playing for the team.” Much now depends on the doubles , when Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot should restore the lead against Istomin and Sanjar Fayziev, as well as how Norrie recovers in the reverse singles against Istomin on Sunday. With characteristic understatement Evans said of his own intense struggle with Istomin, who has won Davis Cup matches for Uzbekistan, “It good to get a win against a guy.‘ For the Birmingham maverick, it was more than just a mood-setting win in a Davis Cup tie; victory represented another stage of his redemption. Elaborating on sentiments he expressed on his return in April from a one-year drugs ban – down the road in a leisure centre in Scotstoun – Evans described his lonely purdah. “You’re just so far away from the world you’re used to. That the hardest part. I had to live a pretty boring, sheltered life, No real existence or importance. I didn’t do much. I just had to play second fiddle. I didn’t have anything to do because I couldn’t play tennis.” But he is back now – still short of his pre-ban best, he concedes, but finding his feet, at times stroking fine winners, from chips and lobs to single-handed backhands that kissed the lines. He sliced more than he bashed, which kept Istomin off-balance on the baseline, though he too contributed to the entertainment with a welter of quality ground strokes, saving five match points before Evans sealed the rubber. Did he have doubts he would make it back? “I’m nowhere near back there yet. I’m only in the world. I still have doubts if I’ll get back, but that pretty normal. Days like today make you see light at the end of the tunnel.” What mattered most was the reception he got from a smaller than usual but equally noisy gathering. There was little dissension about his performance. Of the hardcore fans who occupied of the available seats, there was near-unanimous approval . Dan Evans and Cameron Norrie land on centre stage for a Davis Cup finale Victory for the world fifth-ranked team will enhance their seeding when the competition is decided for the first time in a round robin in Lille or Madrid. The Davis Cup has sacrificed home-and-away romance for a World-Cup style format intended to lure the biggest stars back from more lucrative endeavours in a packed schedule. Murray is not among the abstainers. He is miles away across the Atlantic working on his recovering hip. In a video message on the stadium screen he said, “I’m very sorry I can’t be there to support the team and I will be watching here in Philadelphia.”",741,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/14/dan-evans-great-britain-davis-cup-tennis
67,"Marin Cilic gave Croatia a stranglehold over the United States as he beat Frances Tiafoe, to put the hosts ahead in their Davis Cup semi-final in Zadar on Friday. Cilic overwhelmed the American youngster in the opening two sets but was made to work harder in the third as Tiafoe finally shook off his debut nerves. The match was umpired by Portugal Carlos Ramos – the official accused of sexism by American Serena Williams after docking her a game during a tumultuous US Open final. Thankfully for Ramos this match was a more tranquil affair, apart from the noisy Croatian crowd cheering on their man. “I’m just focusing on this tie and working again. That all I can say,” Ramos told the Associated Press on Friday. Ramos calmed the raucous crowd on several occasions and came down from his chair to check a few ball marks in the clay but otherwise had no impact on the match. “It was great. There were even a few calls where he came to check. Everything was really good,” Cilic said. “The atmosphere was also great. I enjoyed every single second of the match.” Tiafoe, who was making his Davis Cup debut, also didn’t have any complaints. “I didn’t know Ramos was sitting in the chair. I really wasn’t paying attention,” Tiafoe said. “I was more worried about the person across the net than the official.” USA captain Jim Courier added: “We thought the officiating was excellent all day long.” Cilic victory made him Croatia most successful Davis Cup player, moving him past the rubbers won by Ivan Ljubicic. Earlier Coric gave Croatia a flying start by defeating Steve Johnson, in the opening rubber. The Coric had lost his only previous encounter with the US No at Roland Garros but on Zadar clay courts drew first blood for the hosts against Johnson, who was leading his country in the absence of John Isner and Jack Sock. Coric emphatic win just underlined why the Croats, who had won all their four previous ties with the Davis Cup most successful nation, were overwhelming favorites to repeat the dose and reach the final of the last Davis Cup to be played in its traditional historic format before next year revamp. World No Coric was impressive from the start, taking an early break for aided by Johnson missing plenty of first serves, and controlling the opening stanza. The youngster brought the crowd to their feet with one extraordinary ‘tweener’ lob that left Johnson flat-footed as he earned another quick break in the second set but the American fought back strongly to take it to a tiebreak. Coric again stepped up his game, reeling off the final four points of the breaker, featuring a glorious forehand winner and a fine volley, to seal it He then forged home his advantage over the world number in the third set to wrap up victory in two hours and minutes.",488,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/14/usa-croatia-davis-cup-carlos-ramos
68,"It is simultaneously fitting and sad that Great Britain last match in the history of the “old” Davis Cup before the competition morphs into a global experiment of high-risk proportions in should be in Glasgow this weekend, scene of the team finest recent moments. There is symmetry, too, in the return against Uzbekistan of Dan Evans, who has played some excellent tennis in his team cause, in Andy Murray home city – while the Scot will be watching from Philadelphia, where he is still working on his comeback. Asked whether he expected to be playing Davis Cup not long after returning from his one-year drug ban , Evans said: “No, not really. Obviously, with Andy and Kyle [Edmund] not being able to play this week, I was pretty lucky that I got asked to play. Andy Murray will miss Davis Cup to concentrate on return to full fitness “I’ve had some great memories during Davis Cup. I’m sure I’ll be a little nervous going out to play. Four months ago I was playing at the leisure centre down the road [in Scotstoun]. I’m really looking forward to getting out there and representing my country.” Evans, in the world after an encouraging matches since returning in April, beat some decent players to win a Challenger in Vancouver last month before doing less well in Mallorca and France. He said: “I didn’t play so good the past two weeks … probably shouldn’t have played, went straight from Canada to Mallorca – just been trying to get as much tennis as possible. I feel like I’m playing pretty good again.” He will need to against the best Uzbek of them all, Denis Istomin, who turned during the US Open, where he went out in straight sets in the first round to the American Steve Johnson. Cameron Norrie, at the highest-ranked British player available, then faces Jurabek Karimov, the world No Norrie brings with him a flat New Zealand drawl – a legacy of growing up there – a dry sense of humour and a father with what he calls “a filthy Scottish accent”. He said: “My dad travelled all the way from New Zealand yesterday. Got here today. He pretty jet lagged but [it] great to have him here. He grew up here in Glasgow, so it a pretty special moment for us. He grew up here in Glasgow, not far from King Park, went to University of Strathclyde, lived here the majority of his life.” Davis Cup shake-up planned with World Cup-style format Istomin, who plays the doubles on Saturday with Sanjar Fayziev against Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot, nearly got Uzbekistan into the world group in leading them to wins over New Zealand and India before they lost to Kazakhstan in the final play-off. So here they are again, in their attempt at cracking the big&nbsp;time. Not so for Great Britain, of course, the champions who are assured of a place in the new competition, where the best countries will play each other in a round-robin format in Madrid or Lille in November The elder Murray, a six-times major doubles champion coming off winning the mixed title at Flushing Meadows, says he will miss the home-or-away ties next year. “Everyone who comes to watch has a vested interest in one player or one team or another,” he said. “Everyone is cheering – that what gets the passion. I’m expecting we’ll get that again from the crowd [here]. They’ve been so good to us over the past few years. We’ve got a great following.” Soon enough those moments will be wrapped up as memories. Jamie brother, Andy, thought long and hard before deciding he could not interrupt his training schedule to take part in a tie in which Great Britain are favourites. But he will miss the noise as much as anyone. Jamie Murray, meanwhile, joined the chorus of support for Carlos Ramos as the official of the moment prepared to go back to work in Croatia home tie against the United States in Zadar after upsetting Serena Williams in the US Open final at the weekend. “I think that a bit far-fetched,” Murray said of the American claim after losing to Naomi Osaka in straight sets that Ramos was being sexist for docking her a game in the second set after she called him “a liar” and “a thief”. Speaking to BBC Sport, Murray said: “I think the umpire did what was within his rights. Coaching is common. A lot of people are doing it. Some people aren’t getting called for it. To get called in a grand slam final was perhaps a bit tight, but I think the reaction was pretty overboard. I’ve seen a lot of people get called for coaching before, and you might have a grumble and stuff, but you get on with it.” Others who have defended Ramos include Billie Jean King, who was the driving force behind the formation of the women tour and equal pay, the American-Czech legend Martina Navratilova, whose slam titles Williams heads by five and who has had her own battle with prejudice over her sexuality, the United States Davis Cup team captain, Jim Courier, and one of his players, Steve Johnson.",871,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/13/great-britain-cameron-norrie-dan-evans-davis-cup--ennis-scotland-finale-uzbekistan
69,"ucy Kennedy recently earned a new nickname. According to Cycling Australia technical director Brad McGee, the Queensland rider is now known as “the cork”. The moniker was coined after Kennedy debut season in the professional peloton, where even two major crashes didn’t get her down. “She so buoyant – nothing can derail her,” he chuckles. It has been a baptism of fire for Kennedy. While most elite cyclists take up the sport early and progress to the professional ranks by their early Kennedy did not touch a bike until she was – after injuries stopped her from running. She balanced a career as a traffic modeller with rapid progression through the domestic ranks, before signing with Mitchelton-Scott late last year. Anna van der Breggen wins road world championships with astonishing ride “I don’t miss it at all,” Kennedy says of her past office life. “It has been a change but one that I am definitely embracing. While I had been an engineer for five years, ever since I was a little kid all I wanted to be was an athlete. The sport that I wanted to be a professional at has changed many times, but finally I am here. It is a dream come true.” The fairytale continued last week in Austria, where she was part of the Australian team to contest the UCI road world championships. She was the chief lieutenant for Australia leader Amanda Spratt, showing fearsome climbing prowess on one of the toughest world championship courses in decades. Kennedy hard work helped earn Spratt a silver medal – the latter singling out her colleague in the post-race press conference. “I have to thank Lucy, she did an incredible job on the first time up that climb,” Spratt enthused. Speaking to Guardian Australia barely hours later, Kennedy is still in shock. “It is pretty wild really,” she admits. “When they announced the course for this world championships I had this pipe dream. It was a course that would suit me, and on Saturday it happened. I had a really good day on the bike, I did my job and could not be happier.” Spratt support for Kennedy during her debut season made it even sweeter. “It felt like a repayment for her mentorship,” she continued. The counsel of the experienced Spratt has been warmly welcomed during nine tough months for Kennedy. After a strong start to the season in Australia and a fifth-place finish at Strade Bianche in Italy, Kennedy fractured her clavicle, scapula and eye socket during a bad crash at Amstel Gold. “The year started on a high,” explains the tall and lean Kennedy, who still carries a few visible knocks from her physically-demanding campaign. “Then it all came undone.” Kennedy spent three months recovering with her heart set on the Giro Rosa – the toughest race on the women World Tour calendar – only to crash on stage four. “That was really hard to take,” she says. “During recovery I had a single-minded focus on the Giro. The Zoncolan stage – I was just so excited to finally race up a real mountain. Then it all disappeared.” Cycling: Van der Breggen storms to women world road race glory - as it happened Kennedy time off the bike forced reflection about the path that had seen her swap Brisbane for Italy. “In the moment it does not feel crazy – it has progressed naturally from one thing to another,” she says. “But if I think: literally a year ago I was working full-time in an office in Brisbane, it is just bizarre to think where I am right now. “I do miss home,” she continues. “I could have my house and my stable job and my long-term partner Jack – it is hard to be away from that. But if you make the decision to be an athlete, you know what you’re sacrificing.” After a turbulent debut season, Kennedy hopes that will be crash-free and she can contest some of the high-profile races she sat out during the past season. She also has one eye on and a spot in the Australian team for Tokyo. “The Olympics are two years away – they are really the pinnacle of sport,” she said. “The course has been released – it is not a super climber course but it not unrealistic for me. I think that is the main goal now.” Kennedy might have joined the professional peloton later in life than is typical, but she is eager to make up for lost time. The rider showed in Innsbruck, barely a year into her professional career, that she can capably support a real contender against some of the best climbers in the world. Yet Kennedy ultimate ambitions are even loftier than that. “I think I am capable of winning really hard races,” she says. “I have heaps to learn. I am still improving: physically, but particularly everything else – the skills and the tactics. I’m probably never going to be able to read a race as well as Amanda [Spratt] can. But I see myself being able to win big races.”",852,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/02/lucy-kennedy-australian-cyclings-late-bloomer-with-tokyo-in-her-crosshairs

As a select group of riders ascended the Höttinger Höll climb – with a fearsome maximum gradient of – the organisers of the UCI Road World Championships blared AC/DC Highway to Hell throughout Innsbruck. Almost seven hours after the men road race began on Sunday only a handful of contenders remained. Ultimately it was the veteran Alejandro Valverde who found heaven. The Spaniard has contested the world championships times since his debut in Twice he had secured silver medals, four times he claimed bronze. On his attempt the gained the illustrious rainbow stripes. Valverde outsprinted France Romain Bardet, the Canadian Michael Woods and the Dutchman Tom Dumoulin into Innsbruck. His primal screams of celebration said it all. Anna van der Breggen wins road world championships with astonishing ride “This is the victory I have been longing for,” an emotional Valverde said afterwards, clad in the rainbow jersey with a dazzling gold medallion around his neck. “It was my biggest dream to become a world champion. I have been chasing this win forever. I had six medals but none were gold.” On a sunny morning in western Austria riders departed Kufstein to confront the toughest world championships course in more than two decades. A large banner in the historic centre of nearby Innsbruck declared: “A good day for a ride.” The peloton might have disagreed, with to traverse and vertical metres of climbing ahead. After some initial tussling an exuberant breakaway began working together to establish an advantage. The lead stretched out to almost minutes on the opening climb, before Austria and Great Britain upped the ante in the peloton. But the lead did not narrow as much as the bunch would have liked and, for a time, there were legitimate fears that the break could stay away. It was not until the kilometre marker dipped towards double digits that the gap narrowed. When the pace quickened there were notable casualties within the brightly coloured peloton. The newly crowned world time trial champion, Rohan Dennis, and defending world road race champion, Peter Sagan, were both dropped with the finish still away, the exertion on many laps of the Igls ascent proving too much. As the gap slimmed to five minutes with remaining, the well-represented nations began shadow boxing in the peloton. Italy had a go, Spain responded. The victor Michal Kwiatkowski of Poland joined the fun as, a little later, did Belgium Greg Van Avermaet. The Olympic champion briefly led a group away from the peloton and, although it amounted to nothing, Van Avermaet attack did serve to drop Kwiatkowski and Britain Simon Yates from the accelerating peloton. With the pace high, the day-long lead group continued to thin. Soon Norway Vegard Stake Laengen and the Dane Kasper Asgreen were the last men standing, ultimately caught on the penultimate climb. And so it came down to the Höttinger Höll ascent, truly hell for the decimated peloton after so many painful hours in the saddle. Only an elite selection remained to contest the last climb. The grimaces were unmistakable – a fearsome ascent taming some of the sport best climbers, in a crowd-filled cauldron of atmosphere on the outskirts of Innsbruck. Only four survived for the final sprint. A decade and a half after first seeking the rainbow jersey, it would finally belong to Valverde.",566,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/evergreen-alejandro-valverde-top-of-world

The TV coverage has cut out before we can see Valverde take his gong – but what a worthy champion he was, and what a race we saw there, building up to a remarkable climax. Those who took part deserve a rest; I’m going off for one now too. Thanks very much indeed for your company, as ever – enjoy the rest of your weekend! Top in full: – Valverde – Bardet – Woods – Dumoulin – Moscon – Kreuziger – Valgren – Alaphilippe – Pinot – Costa Pete Kennaugh, another fine performer until the last, speaks: “I feel sick now! But what a race. I didn’t expect it to be so hard early on, the break took a while to go. It was really strange without radios, there was one point when I looked behind on the climb and there were or guys left. It was like a war of attrition all day.” A deserving winner? I think so. Valverde just got stronger and stronger, earning the rainbow jersey. But there were so many fine performances there. Dumoulin came in from nowhere to push so hard at the end. Valgren really helped spice things up at the end. The members of that remarkably durable lead group, who kept going for so long, helped make this the right and totally unpredictable race this was. And we hardly even saw the favourite, Alaphilippe, until he entered the fringes of the chase at the end. Valverde looks as if he can’t quite believe it. What a race that was! The final few kilometres were absolutely incredible. It thinned out like this at the end: – Valverde Bardet – Woods – Dumoulin – Moscon Alejandro Valverde wins the road race championships! The is world champion at last! Twice second, four times third – and this time he done it!

He got this in the bag if he keeps going a few metres more ... to go: It these four – Bardet, Valverde, Woods, Dumoulin – slugging it out at the last ... to go: He clearly got an issue with his rear break, he fiddling with it there, but if he can attack those front three in the final two kilometres ... Updated at BST to go: Hello, Dumoulin is catching up! What mechanical problems? He just three seconds behind and can scent blood! What a recovery! to go: That better! Bardet takes over. They’re near the bottom now – then it a sprint on the flat. Dumoulin is still about, but seconds behind. Moscon is fifth I think. Valverde is ahead, Bardet second, Woods third. He is strong on the descent and if he can stretch it out here ... and meanwhile there word that Dumoulin may have a mechanical issue! That’ll be it for him surely. Yes, very impressive of the broadcasters to take the remaining distance off the screen right as we enter the last knockings. Alaphilippe is shown now but I don’t think he is going to feature here. We have Bardet, Valverde and Woods, with Dumoulin in pursuit, in the running as they begin their descent. Five or six kilometres left! They’ve reached the top and Valverde, so often the bridesmaid, steps up before Bardet pushes clear! Woods is now a clear third, Dumoulin fourth. The kilometre count has disappeared from my screen, so apologies for a lack of precision. to go: Woods has really come through here. The Canadian could even do this if he can make it to the top in front! The crowd roar them on. This is quite something; this is what we’ve waited seven hours or so for! to go: It as if they are treading water. This is as brutal as everyone said. Michael Woods is currently in the lead.

Valverde is in there too. to go: The French are lining up to try and help Alaphilippe through; the peloton is starting to split again. Valgren has the face of a man who knows something unpleasant may be tailing him. He glances behind him. The gap is seconds. I’m not sure he can hold on. This looks *so* painful, ascending these narrow mountain streets. to go: What a finale we are in for here! Game ON! to go: In pursuit are, mainly, Italian and Dutch riders at the moment. Now Valgren starts this much-trailed, utterly hellish-sounding climb with an advantage of half a minute. Is it enough? to go: His advantage is now seconds. Who would dare to strain every sinew to give chase at this point? There a climb to get ready for ... but a leader to close in on. It tight and tense and tactical! to go: Valgren has completed his descent, now has to work the flat on the outskirts of the city, and then has to prepare for the climb on his own. He needs to really put something into this section. to go: Pinot and Kennaugh are foremost among a pack of six who are chasing Valgren – the pressure could yet be on. to go: Valgren has a chance here; you sense he knows it. One huge climb to go ... to go: Valgren has opened himself up a four or five-second lead. The peloton is incredibly well staffed, this race has really taken a long time to thin out properly and that makes it so, so hard to call. to go: Kennaugh probably can’t keep this up, he really gritting his teeth here, it now Michael Valgren in front. And the Dane is pushing on promisingly ... to go: Wow! Pete Kennaugh makes one heck of a charge ahead of the entire peloton! Is he going to lead this race into its latter stages? He out there in front and now the big guns are going to have to do something! to go: Laengen and Asgreen are, at long, long last, overhauled. What a day from them, though! Van Avermaet then slows up, that second charge having been one too many. It brutal climbing, this. Many of the big names are now starting to show, but some are yet to ... to go: Yes, it the Dutch attacking the climb here. Ten seconds’ gap to the leaders ... to go: Oh, Nibali drops from the front of the group! Is that him done? Never say never with him, but I’d be surprised if he was back. If you’ve been with us since the start of the day, you’re getting your reward now! to go: Steven Kruijswijk makes an attack now, and Van Avermaet is back too! He seemed to have faded but he charges on now with the Dutchman. Thibaut Pinot is up there too. The Italians aren’t having it their own way anymore! to go: We’re now down to one minute for the leaders’ gap. I think they’ll be overhauled soon enough, sadly, before they can genuinely have a tilt at an upset. to go: Asgreen and Laengen are only one and a half minutes ahead now. Caruso and Brambilla drop back from the front of the chase, they’ve done their job there. That final climb could be quite special as things stand. to go: Nibali is up there too. There are five or six of them. It some sight! to go: Still no Alaphilippe. Still no Valverde. Will one of them just pelt it clear at the last? Are they saving it all until the final It the Italian team taking all the responsibility out there at the moment, in a mass break of their very own at the front of the peloton. to go: Adam Yates is still in the first chase group – so he well in the mix ... to go: That lead is now down to though, and they’ll want to at least consolidate it before the climb. Caruso and Brambilla are the Italian contingent giving closest chase. to go: The leading pair start their last lap – but it a bigger lap with the huge “road to hell” climb of and a gradient, remember. Neither of them is renowned for this sort of thing. They couldn’t ... could they? to go: That Van Avermaet charge came to nothing, incidentally, but I think played an important part in stepping things up a notch or two. to go: That last climb seemed to cull a lot of the peloton members although, in the descent, we might see one or two come back into play. It still a pretty big group in there and we’re still yet to see one of the major favourites make a big play for the front. to go: If anything, those two at the front are stretching their lead very slightly. What is going to happen in the next minutes or so?! to go: It really getting busy now. The Italians are currently impressing, led by Caruso. They have a good chance here as we stand. Asgreen and Laengen are the two remaining from that front pack and at this point who on earth would completely discount them? to go: There now a group of nine or so riders getting away, and they’re just two minutes and seconds behind the rump of that lead pack. to go: Michal Kwiatkowski is also having issues. Who going to be left at the end?! to go: Haven’t mentioned the favourite, Alaphilippe, yet. He just couched in there, not making any kind of move yet. A bit of a concern here meanwhile about Simon Yates – he dropping off and I fear that probably means no way back on a day like this. He out of the running. to go: The peloton is really starting to string out and split now. Van Avermaet has a few interested parties on his tail here. There all sorts going on up there. It time to attack! to go: Damiano Caruso and Omar Fraile Materanz are up there now in that Van Avermaet break – it those three pushing at the moment, chasing hard. They’ll surely be joined soon. to go: The Yates brothers are starting to make a bit of a move. Roglic is still with us by the way despite that earlier tumble, still looking strong, competing like the force that he is. of Newest Oldest Cycling Men",1790,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/sep/30/cycling-mens-world-road-race-championships-live
72,"She had won gold at the Olympic Games and European Championships. She had won the Giro Rosa and La Course by Tour de France. But for so long, success at the UCI Road World Championships had proven elusive for Anna van der Breggen. On four occasions the Dutchwoman had placed in the road race top including second in Three times she had won the individual time trial silver medal, most recently on Tuesday. But as her compatriots Annemiek van Vleuten and Chantal Blaak added world titles to their palmares in recent years, the rainbow jersey remained conspicuously absent from Van der Breggen record. That changed here on Saturday. In an astonishing piece of solo riding, Van der Breggen bridged to a strong breakaway on the penultimate climb of the road race. She then attacked again, effortlessly riding away from Australia Amanda Spratt. Completing the last without company, the Boels-Dolmans rider never looked at risk of being caught. As she crossed the finish line, the relief was unmistakable. Finally, Van der Breggen could rightfully claim to be the best female rider in the world. Her lead over Spratt was the biggest winning margin in decades. Italy Tatiana Guderzo claimed bronze. Anna van der Breggen storms to women world road race cycling glory Van der Breggen had dedicated her season to the world championships, bypassing the defence of her Giro Rosa jersey and adopting an unorthodox race schedule – even including some mountain biking. But she said the singular focus had added pressure. “I was happy this morning that tonight, no matter how it went, it would be over and I could enjoy cycling again,” she said. But the smile on her face suggested it had all been worthwhile. “When I crossed the finish line it was relief – that it finally worked out,” she said. “I won it this time. I am really thankful for that.” An elated Spratt heaped praise on her victorious rival: “She was on another level. She really showed that she was so, so strong. I’m proud of the silver medal.” A total of riders began the first climber-friendly world championships in recent memory, rolling out of picturesque Kufstein near the German border under sunny autumn skies. The Polish team activated the race early, with Aurela Nerlo establishing a modest lead over the peloton before being joined by Colombia Ana Cristina Sanabria. The race stretched as the riders headed towards a first potent climb, with the ascent to Gnadenwald featuring sections of gradient. At one point there were four separate groups, but the key nations of the Netherlands, Australia, Italy and the United States looked untroubled. Or at least they did, until a crash at Gnadenwald base among the road furniture complicated proceedings. Van Vleuten, the pre-race favourite, and Britain Dani Rowe were among those to fall, with the former looking particularly shaken as she exerted herself to rejoin the peloton. Normality returned as the climb slimmed the main group to a select few, including Van Vleuten, before the race temporarily reformed on the descent into Innsbruck. But as the peloton passed a multinational crowd in the old city and headed back towards the mountains, the peloton thinned once more. Eventually, a serious breakaway of six formed, led by Spratt. When Ellen van Dijk was dropped, Van der Breggen went ahead of the chasers to ensure the orange-clad team would be represented at the front. After joining Spratt and company on the second loop of the Olympic Circuit, Van der Breggen kept going – first with the Australian and then alone. The Dutchwoman was unstoppable on the final circuit, building her lead right until the end. Rainbow stripes were a long time coming for Van der Breggen, but she finally claimed a world championship triumph for the ages.",631,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/anna-van-der-breggen-wins-road-world-championships-with-astonishing-ride

Rowe, who finished behind the winner, said: “It was absolutely brutal. Had a lot of bad luck, I got caught in a crash (involving Annemiek van Vleuten) so had to chase back on. I didn’t panic but got back on just before the circuit. “I know I’m not the best climber but had to measure my effort. Up this climb the second time my chain got stuck and had a bike change with a lap to go... just had to give it as much as I could. “I’m not a mountain goat but I’m really proud how I rode and it always amazing to represent GB at the world championships.” On Van der Breggen... “They’re absolutely incredible. Hats off to her. It amazing to see.” Updated at BST Anna van der Breggen has been speaking... She said: “I just kept going until the finish line. I only believed it was possible to win at the end. Too many times this season I had problems at the finish line so I just kept on and tried to eat and drink and go as fast as possible. “I was doubting if it (her attack) was too early or not but I got in position and took the opportunity so I had to go. “World Championships are always a goal at the start of the season but I know how difficult it is to win this title so I’m delighted.” Annamiek van Vleuten and teammate Amy Pieters punch the air as they also finish, delighted for Van der Breggen. Tatiana Guderzo is over the line , behind Van der Breggen, for a bronze to complete the set of medals at the World Championships. Meanwhile, Emilia Fahlin of Sweden claimed fourth with a nice sprint finished at the end there. Amanda Spratt has the silver for Australia , coming home behind Anna van der Breggen. She well, well back but after being dropped on that climb it was a prudent ride of her to allow the Dutch rider to take the lead and then concentrate on second. Despite plenty of action behind her, she was able to consolidate that position riding all on her own for around Updated at BST Anna van der Breggen is the new world champion And there a smile from the Dutch rider as she cruises over the line. This was as emphatic as the gap will show. All the talk leading into the race was of team orders and who would be leader between her, Annamiek van Vleuten and Lucinda Brand. In the end, it didn’t matter. She countered her teammate attack into Innsbruck and after catching Amanda Spratt on the second lap through the town there was only going to be one winner. Updated at BST to go: Little more to report other than Van der Breggen is clear but still has head down and is still pushing, though, not chance for celebration just yet. Second-place Spratt is earning the applause through the streets of Innsbruck and this should be another big result for Australian cycling following Simon Yates’ win at the Vuelta for Mitchelton-Scott and Rohan Dennis claiming the men time trial earlier this week. to go: Applause for Van der Breggen as she glides through Innsbruck. Her lead up to now. Amanda Spratt is descending and well clear in second with Tatiana Guderzo looking good for the bronze. to go: Van der Breggen gap keeps increasing and has now gone past This is some ride.

She in the lead and halfway through the climb. Updated at BST to go: That bronze medal group has now become six with the other two riders being Karol-Ann Canuel (Canada) and Tatiana Guderzo (Italy). to go: There is another chasing group of three riders, including Amy Pieters of the Netherlands, that should contest the bronze with Fahlin, Rivera and Jasinska. Spratt, meanwhile, looks very uncomfortable but is still clear in second. to go: Assuming Van der Breggen has this won, with the gap approaching and Spratt is comfortable for second, the battle for third could be very interesting with Fahlin (Sweden), Rivera (USA) and Jasinska (Poland) close together and the peloton, technically, still in range with the climb to come. Rivera, especially, has been pushing hard throughout and as a sprinter, it impressive to see her still competing for a podium at this stage. And here they are , greeted by... yes, you guessed it, La Bamba by Los Lobos... well, you probably didn’t. Anyway, they’re behind Van der Breggen, so this will take some collapse by the Dutch rider. Updated at BST The next three riders – Fahlin, Rivera and Jasinska – are next, behind Van der Breggen time.

That seems almost insurmountable. Van der Breggen has been a runner-up three times at the World Championships, twice in the time trial and at the road race. It all in her hands now... Van der Breggen takes the lead to go: Van der Breggen attacks and Spratt has cracked, the Dutch rider is clear and will take some stopping given her climbing prowess. to go: Coryn Rivera (USA) is the lone chaser, behind, but doesn’t look like she can catch the front two, as it stands. to go: This is developing into a fun duel with Anna van der Breggen and Amanda Spratt now in the lead. from the top of the climb. to go: That is some pace by Van der Breggen who has now caught the leaders and moves to the front. to go: Now Anna van der Breggen is off! Van Vleuten can’t follow and the Olympic champion is out on her own, chasing down the leaders. Updated at BST to go: Five riders are leading on the climb: Coryn Rivera (USA), Amanda Spratt (Australia), Emilia Fahlin (Sweden), Elena Pirrone (Italy) and Malgorzata Jasinska (Poland).

The gap is Updated at BST to go: Bad news for the Dutch as Ellen van Dijk has been dropped. All their strongest riders are away... if you’re picking a favourite right now, it Australia Amanda Spratt but still plenty more to do. Back in the chasers, Lucinda Brand is on the move for the Netherlands, trying to close that gap. to go: Somebody in that chasing group is going to have to push now because the gap to the leaders is and the riders are climbing again. Updated at BST to go: Rivera has been caught to form a leading group of six. Quick update on some of the other favourites at the end of the first lap: Dutch duo Anna van der Breggen and Annamiek van Vleuten were back along with Poland Katarzyna Niewiadoma. First lap of Innsbruck As Rivera completes the first lap ahead, confirmation of that group: Ellen van Dijk (Netherlands), Amanda Spratt (Australia), Emilia Fahlin (Sweden), Elena Pirrone (Italy) and Malgorzata Jasinska (Poland). to go: Rivera doing a hugely impressive job at the front, maintaining her lead. Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands and Australia Amanda Spratt are among a five-strong chasing group as we’re nearing the end of the first lap around Innsbruck. Two more to go. to go: There was a short paved section which could cause problems a bit later on and the roads are pretty narrow. Elisa Longo Borghini of Italy is now attacking Rivera, followed by Anna van der Breggen, who been quiet up to now, and Amanda Spratt. Updated at BST to go: Rivera is being hunted down with gap now Lucinda Brand looks the most likely to catch her at present. We’re into the centre of Innsbruck with the crowd growing and, it has to be said, some delightful architecture. to go: At the bottom of the descent and Rivera is ahead of the chasing group, which includes Amanda Spratt. Impressive stuff given her crash. to go: Rivera looking good on the descent and taking the issue to the Dutch who have plenty of riders well-placed – Anna van de Breggen, Annemiek van Vleuten, Lucinda Brand – but probably didn’t want to push so hard at this stage. Meanwhile, Amanda Spratt has gone into a ditch on the descent. She looks okay but that not good news for Australia especially after the work Lucy Kennedy put in on the climb.

Updated at BST to go: The leading trio are approaching the top of the climb (which they’ll have conquer twice more) in Innsbruck and the gap has closed to Australia Lucy Kennedy has been at the front of the chasing group for a long time and looks to be setting up Amanda Spratt who is a definite contender in this race. Britain Dani Rowe and Sophie Wright, meanwhile, have been dropped in that group. to go: Of that chasing group, Australia Amanda Spratt and Annemiek Van Vleuten are there, plus Dutch teammates Chantal Blaak and Lucinda Brand. The leaders are ahead. to go: Finland Lotta Lepisto who has been near the front all race is dropped but instead of retreating back into the peloton, she stands back up and tries to catch the chasers. to go: Hello again. Well, well, well all change at the front then as Sanabria has been caught by a group of three: Ellen van Dijk (Netherlands), Tatiana Guderzo (Italy) and Cecilie Ludwig (Denmark), with a huge chasing group behind. And with that, I’m just nipping out for a quick break. to go: Janneke Ensing has dropped back to the Netherlands’ team car to get some medicine for Annemiek Van Vleuten following that crash. The inference being, Van Vleuten doesn’t want to make it known to her rivals that she struggling so sent her teammate back instead.

74,"In one of the most mountainous world road race championships ever held, and in the absence of Lizzie Deignan – who has just given birth to her daughter, Orla – Saturday women title race in Innsbruck will give a chance for new British riders to shine. Among them is this year shooting star Sophie Wright, the former mountain bike racer who unexpectedly lit up the European championship in Glasgow in August. The Norfolk rider transferred from the Great Britain mountain bike squad to the road in the spring, having decided she wanted a career in road racing after winning the European junior mountain bike title and two national championships off-road. She was immediately rewarded with victory in the Tour of the Reservoir national road race series event, but it was the European championship where she truly came to prominence, with a crowd-pleasing escape, largely on her own, that gained her a three-minute lead at one point. Wright did not make the medals in Glasgow, but her move worked as planned, as it paved the way for late attacks from her leader on the day Dani Rowe, who will also be part of the Great Britain team on Saturday. Australia Dennis conquers past to win cycling world title Her courageous solo effort also earned her a WorldTour professional team place with Cervélo-Bigla, for whom she rode strongly in the recent Tour of Tuscany. It all marks a rapid progression since when she had two operations to solve a cardiac issue which resulted in her heart beating at up to beats per minute. “She like a coiled spring. It will be exciting to see what her youthful exuberance can achieve on the course,” said the Great Britain women road team coach, Julian Winn, who played an influential role in Nicole Cooke Olympic gold medal in Beijing and has tracked Wright progress since spotting her in a mountain bike event several years ago. He added: “I don’t want to put pressure on her, I just want to see her have a straightforward race with no mechanicals, and not getting caught behind any crashes. I’m sure she can climb with the best and get in that front group.” Rowe, meanwhile, will look to build on some promising performances this season, including second in the Tour de Yorkshire, third in the Women Tour and bronze in the Commonwealth Games. On the evidence of the opening days of racing, with fields scattered to the four winds, the course outside Innsbruck is the hardest world championship circuit since the mountainous race in Duitama, Colombia in It is a relatively long route at but the main circuit, tackled three times by the women, includes the climb of Igls, one of the longest seen in a recent worlds, almost in length with stretches at There is a flat run from the foot of the descent into the finish but the climb is so long that pure climbers will probably be able to open a decisive gap before then. While the field includes strong climbers in Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig of Denmark, Amanda Spratt of Australia and the Tour de Yorkshire winner Megan Guarnier, all eyes will be on the Dutch duo Annemiek van Vleuten, the gold medallist in the time trial on Tuesday, and the Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen. In Glasgow at the European championship the Dutch squad were dominant but rode a tactically disastrous race and were outwitted by the sprinter Marta Bastianelli; in Innsbruck the volume of climbing means that is unlikely to happen again. “On this course you either have good legs or you haven’t,” said Winn. “There will be no tactics.”",607,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/28/sophie-wright-world-road-race-scale-heights
75,"Ahead of his campaign, cyclist Rohan Dennis reflected on four years of misfortune. “If you keep knocking on the door, one day it will open,” the South Australian mused in January. On a sunny September day in Innsbruck, Austria, Dennis kicked the door off its hinges. His time of across a challenging time trial course was more than a minute faster than rival and defending world champion Tom Dumoulin. Donning the hallowed rainbow jersey on the post-race podium, Dennis elation was unmistakable. Rohan Dennis stuns Tom Dumoulin to claim World Road Race time trial title For the this triumph has been a long time coming. A development product of the Australian Institute of Sport, Dennis announced himself in with a track world title in Denmark. He repeated that feat a year later, before a silver medal followed at the velodrome during the London Olympics. After transitioning to the road, Dennis broke the Tour de France speed record on the opening stage in and briefly wore the yellow jersey. But time trial success in national colours would prove elusive. The rider was on course for a podium finish at the cycling world championships when a puncture dashed his hopes. A year later at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, a broken aero bar necessitated a medal prospect-ending bike change. months ago, Dennis was second fastest at an intermediate time check only to crash in wet Norwegian conditions to end his world title hopes. “I have done all three: punctured, crashed and broke my bike. So what else can go wrong?” he later joked to SBS. This year, the stars aligned. Dennis opened his campaign with a dominant time trial victory at the Australian championships in Ballarat, securing the national crown for a third consecutive season. He won individual time trials at the Abu Dhabi Tour, Tirreno-Adriatico and Giro d’Italia, before travelling to the final grand tour of the year – the Vuelta a España – in imposing form. In Spain, Dennis showed his versatility against the clock: comfortably winning both the race opener and a bumpy time trial in the third week of the Vuelta. In scenic Innsbruck, three obstacles stood between Dennis and the iconic rainbow stripes worn by world champions: the mental demons of recent misfortunes, champion Dumoulin and a climb that reached a maximum pitch of per cent. Ultimately, none proved insurmountable. Dennis started strongly and clocked the fastest time against the first intermediate point, before increasing his lead over Dumoulin on the steep climb. Clambering into the hot-seat with only the Dutchman remaining on course, Dennis triumph was secured – although not that he was taking any chances. “I was considering a bit of a victory salute but I wanted to make sure as you are never sure until Tom crosses the line,” he said afterwards. The Adelaide local becomes just the second Australian to win time trial world title, following in the footsteps of Canberran Michael Rogers who won a three-peat in the early The odds of Dennis repeating that hat-trick are not favourable. The rider has spoken publicly about his ongoing transition into a general classification rider, and consequent switch in attention away from the time trial discipline. His move to World Tour team Bahrain-Merida will likely see added emphasis on a more holistic approach to one-week races and three-week grand tours. But such dilemmas can wait. The time trial world title has been a goal of Dennis ever since he first emerged in the junior ranks, but one that had always evaded him. Having focused several successive seasons towards this ambition only to fall at the final hurdle, victory is particularly sweet. “I have never won it in any age group, so to win my first one in seniors is really special,” he said. The win provides a worthwhile lesson in persistence, from a rider whose career has charted great heights and plummeted to grim lows. Throughout, Dennis kept on knocking on that door. Finally, on Wednesday it opened – to reveal world championship rainbows.",671,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/27/australias-dennis-conquerors-past-to-win-cycling-world-title
76,"The road race world championships in Yorkshire next year will tap directly into memories of the Tour de France Grand Départ with the flagship men elite race on September. The climax of eight days’ racing will replicate the first stage of the Tour loop into the Yorkshire Dales national park for a large part of the course starting in Leeds and finishing in Harrogate. Just as the Tour did five years earlier, the world championships will head north-west out of Leeds through Otley and Skipton to tackle the ascents of Buttertubs and Grinton Moor before heading back into Harrogate, the principal host town for the races in eight days of competition for junior men and women, men and elite racers. Annemiek van Vleuten retains world time-trial title as Dutch riders dominate As is now normal practice, the various races will start in towns across the region, but the series will for the first time incorporate four paralympic road races, on day one, September, over a variety of distances on a course from Beverley to Harrogate. Day two will feature a novel mixed team time trial relay contested by national teams comprising three men and three women. The races will mostly start outside Harrogate: Ripon for the men and women time trials, Northallerton for the men elite time trial, Richmond for the men junior road race, Doncaster for the junior women and men road races, Bradford for the elite women – where it is hoped that the champion Lizzie Deignan will ride months after the birth of her daughter Orla – and finally the elite men in Leeds. Twelve months after what is expected to be the hilliest world road race championship of the modern era in Innsbruck, the undulating circuit in Harrogate on which most of the races will finish looks set to provide easier racing, where the world championships is as much a test of stamina and bike-handling rather than pure climbing ability. The Harrogate circuit will be based on heading due west straight up the Otley Road, before an up-and-down return into the town centre, finishing in West Park, where the Tour opening stage ended. The final includes eight bends in the town centre, with three turns in the final kilometre before the slightly uphill finish. The circuit will be key to the championships, as it is used to complete eight of the races, the exception being the junior women road races and the men elite time trial. The elite men will cover it seven times after their loop through the Dales, while the women and men will take in three circuits. The women race will include the climbs of Norwood Edge, which featured in this year Tour de Yorkshire, and Lofthouse, between the village of the same name and Masham, while the men will have to tackle Greenhow, outside Pateley Bridge, which has an average gradient of for its The climbs outside Harrogate come relatively early, so are unlikely to split the fields.

That a lot of Lance-a-ritas . This week Armstrong has weighed in on the election for president of the professional cyclists’ union. Specifically, his distaste at the candidacy of David Millar, a man who was once his teammate but who committed the solecism of calling on him to come clean back when he was still getting away with it. You’d think their shared life experiences might have earned Millar a little empathy. But Armstrong has no time for his former brother-in-arms, even when those arms all had artificially high blood counts. Armstrong was outraged that Millar had the audacity to lobby for a role in the sport he contaminated. “Millar is probably the last person that would come to mind for this role,” he said. It charmingly endearing, isn’t it, to know that he can’t think of anyone who might be a worse candidate. Armstrong objections are that Millar will not provide the riders with the protection and the strong voice they deserve. Armstrong was, of course, known to be passionate about the welfare of the peloton when he was competing. Although it is perhaps a sign of how much he has grown that giving them a say has worked its way so far up his list of priorities. He wasn’t quite so keen for his colleagues or employees to be heard when they were on the brink of exposing him. But the world today is a very different one from that dark time, back in when that giant conspiracy was determined to dirty his halo. Happily, these days it is possible to rewrite and even simply ignore the unfortunate things one has said and done in the past. In fact, Armstrong understanding of how malleable truth can be is surely only to his long-term credit in today public sphere. In the era of our post-truth politics, brass neck and sheer gall are precious commodities. So perhaps when he was accusing Floyd Landis of being “desperate for attention and money”, calling his masseuse an alcoholic whore and deriding the investigation against him as an “unconstitutional witch hunt”, he was just ahead of his time. It can be no coincidence that, on the day that Armstrong finally gave up his legal defence, there was one voice warning him against it. “I never thought he was a quitter,” tweeted Donald Trump. “He should immediately reconsider or his legacy is ruined.” Let us hope it brings president Trump joy to know he was mistaken. That, six years after Armstrong lifelong ban from the sport he had disgraced, the man who determinedly cheated, lied and bullied his way to an almost successful cover-up is back in our lives with a podcast. Annemiek van Vleuten retains world time-trial title as Dutch riders dominate It was, Armstrong told his listeners in July, “super humbling” to be this popular again. “For me it was really humbling that it was almost a validation. I mean you had a show that had five million downloads in three weeks,” he added, humbly. As his own website asks: “Who believes that the most meaningful revelations emerge at the far edge of your limits – that there are flashes of self-truth in moments of suffering?” We du. Whether Armstrong has actually attained such enlightenment, only he and his buddy Oprah may ever know. It would certainly be easier to enjoy his rebranding and his range of T-shirt logos – “Sūffer”, “Soūl” and “Get Oūt” – if the contrition he offered for his past actions felt less self-absorbed. Take his recent appearance on the Freakonomics podcast , in which the interviewer congratulated him on how far he had come. And it was true, Armstrong did say he understood why people hated him and that “people had suffered this tremendous sense of betrayal”, which is almost but not quite the same thing as saying you feel ashamed that you betrayed them. He pointed out that he had tried to make amends to those he’d wronged. “This thing cost me he said. “Everybody been paid back.” He also, however, said he wouldn’t change a thing and complained he had been treated unfairly compared to Alex Rodriguez, who was allowed to return to baseball after his drugs scandal. Which brings us back to Millar. Armstrong ongoing gripe at the cycling authorities is how the big fish caught in the dopers’ net were made examples of while the small fry were “given complete passes”. One can’t help speculating that Millar own rehabilitation is part of the “hypocritical and unfair” situation Armstrong now discerns. Hypocrisy? Unfairness? How very dare they. Armstrong own return to the cycling world is surely a matter of earnest, selfless rehabilitation, a precursor to a second act that will win us all over again. As the man himself says, this thing cost him enough. He had to pass up Dancing with the Stars every year just to look sorry. Perhaps it time he headed to the jungle for I’m a Celebrity. Now that what I call rehabilitation.",978,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/26/lance-armstrong-biggest-comeback-sport-disgraced
79,"A P-plate driver who fatally hit British ultra-endurance cyclist Mike Hall will not be forced to give evidence to the coronial inquest into his death. Shegu Bobb was when he hit Hall on the Monaro Highway, south of Canberra , in darkness at on March last year. Hall, who was running second in the Indian Pacific Wheel Race – a event from Fremantle to Sydney – died at the scene. Ken Archer, counsel assisting, told the court on Wednesday that Bobb had proven to be a “highly suggestible” witness in interviews with police. Mike Hall inquest: two other drivers almost hit ultra-endurance cyclist, court hears He said he should be not be compelled to give evidence. “Mr Bobb has consistently said he simply did not see Mr Hall,” Archer said. The coroner, Bernadette Boss, said English was a second language for Bobb, who was born in Sierra Leone and moved to Australia in She said he was a very vulnerable person who would add little to the evidence already heard during the first two-and-a-half days of the inquest. “The quality of his evidence would be very poor,” Boss said. Craig Lynch, representing Hall partner Anna Haslock, did not object. Archer said Hall mother also didn’t push for Bobb to be put on the witness stand. British ultra-endurance cyclist killed almost instantly, inquest told Earlier on Wednesday, witnesses told the court they had seen Bobb after the incident with his phone in his lap with triple-zero on the line but unable to speak due to shock. Witnesses have given conflicting accounts of Hall visibility on the morning he was killed. A video was shown of Hall riding less than hours before his death, with both front and rear lights working. But a truck driver, Matthew Smith, said he saw Hall “wandering” on the road, forcing Smith to drive on the wrong side to avoid him. “The morning I saw him he wasn’t lit up like that [on the video],” Smith said. Snr Const Craig Slater, who is stationed at the nearby town of Michelago, passed Hall travelling in the opposite direction and said he was hard to see. Asked why he didn’t stop to tell Hall he was at risk, Slater said: “It a question I ask myself to this day.” Hall death sent shockwaves through the cycling community, with the respected rider considered one of the best ultra-endurance competitors in the world.",402,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/26/mike-hall-inquest-driver-who-hit-endurance-cyclist-will-not-give-evidence
80,"David Millar candidacy for president of the professional riders’ union, the CPA, may have the support of Geraint Thomas and Chris Froome but his suitability to lead the professional peloton has been questioned by his former teammate, Lance Armstrong . “Millar is probably the last person that would come to mind for this role,” Armstrong told the Guardian of the CPA presidency election on Thursday. The American scepticism follows a whispering campaign against the Scot past character and his efforts to oust the long-standing CPA president, Gianni Bugno. Annemiek van Vleuten defends world time trial title as Dutch riders dominate Armstrong, who recently visited the Tour champion Jan Ullrich as he underwent rehab for alcohol and drug addiction in Germany, has long described the peloton as downtrodden and lacking a voice, but was equally dismissive of Millar agenda for change and of the riders’ union itself. “I wouldn’t even call it change because there nothing really there to even consider changing,” the American said. “I’d propose creating a real union for the riders, not the window dressing that is the CPA.” Millar, however, believes that the power of the peloton to achieve change is real. “I wouldn’t be interested in doing this if I didn’t think it had potential, and the potential now is bigger because of the lack of unification within the sport,” he said. “The one common denominator is the peloton.” Millar and Armstrong were briefly teammates at Cofidis in the late Since then the American has been stripped of all seven Tour de France wins for doping offences while Millar, now a writer, broadcaster and clothing designer, served a two-year ban for doping between and Millar accepts that pointing out his history is an easy card for critics to play and it has been readily dealt against him during his campaign. “My history isn’t the point, though,” he said. “This election isn’t about the past.” Although his campaign focuses around greater advocacy, job security and wealth sharing within the professional peloton, he acknowledges that his own experiences of doping and recovery from depression and humiliation have influenced his candidacy. “The CPA has never confronted the fact that the mental-health track record for cycling is horrific,” Millar said. “The Ullrich case was one of my motivations. Nobody in cycling does very much about it, or recognises it for what it is, or calls it what it is. It was as if people were, ‘Oh well, there goes another one from the I felt that was just bullshit. It was a tipping point for me. “I had an awakening to the duty of care aspect when I was invited to a Rugby Players’ Association (RPA) dinner last year. The RPA has two really strong messages – if an athlete is injured it helps support them. Post-career, it also acknowledges that retired athletes can suffer depression.” Armstrong shares Millar view that psychiatric care of humiliated or disgraced riders – such as Ullrich, the Giro d’Italia and Tour de France winner, Marco Pantani, who died in , the Belgian prodigy Frank Vandenbroucke, who suffered addiction problems and died in and Spain José María Jiménez, who battled with depression and died in a clinic in – has been chronically poor. “Those riders were all ‘disgraced’ by their countries and the press, while their countrymen, who weren’t nearly as legendary as them, were given complete passes,” Armstrong said. “This can feel really hypocritical and unfair. Throw in some guys who don’t have the mental strength to manage it all and it a recipe for disaster.” But Armstrong denies the suggestion that there is a connection between a culture of doping as an athlete and a reliance on recreational drugs in retirement. “I don’t think there is,” he said. “The sample size of cyclists that took performance enhancing drugs is massive — in the tens of thousands — so if the tendency was to become an addict then we’d have hundreds if not thousands of addicts, which we don’t. It like the question I used to always get, did drugs cause my cancer? Same scenario — we’d have hundreds of guys with testicular cancer and we don’t. We have two — Ivan Basso and me.” Carywn Jones, a professor in sports ethics at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said that professional cycling is a “paradigmatic example” of a sport peopled by athletes who are predisposed to addictive behaviours. “In elite sport, where you have to spend a lot of time obsessing about performance, tiny margins of improvement, your diet, your weight, body fat – all things that allow you to latch on to obsessive compulsive traits – cycling exemplifies that. Cycling is pretty much perfect if you’re obsessive compulsive. That may lead you to search for other means to improve, or control, your performance.” Jones acknowledges that the prevailing narrative is that when vulnerable elites retire they develop an addiction, but he feels this may already have been present. “I think they may have had this obsessive compulsive behaviour all through their career, but then they retire and need to find another fix.” Jones says that Ullrich decline follows a miserable but familiar trajectory. “An addict is looking for a solution to a problem outside of himself. If they are relying on sport to fix them, then it likely that this will spill out when they are no longer able to use this sport.” It is speculative to suggest what triggered Ullrich problems but the shame and humiliation of the Operación Puerto scandal in and the subsequent vilification of his sporting achievements in Germany almost certainly contributed. “Shaming can go in two ways,” Jones says. “Addicts have a sense of self and self-worth. To some extent what they are doing is presenting to the outside world a kind of lie.” Whatever your opinion on Lance Armstrong, liking his podcast is not a sin | Barry Glendenning But Jones added that the specific demands of elite endurance cycling is akin to working in the military. “We want soldiers to do a particularly difficult and dangerous thing. “ In the same way we want Tour de France riders to do things that are really unreasonable. We need to have a conversation about what elite sport entails, but what I would advocate is that we consider ‘red flags’ – certain types of behaviours that we need to deal with.” Millar, meanwhile, accepts that he is unlikely to win Thursday vote but he remains happy to be seen as an agent provocateur. “This has been an undemocratic process,” he said of the CPA elections. “It not martyrdom on my side. Whatever happens I think the peloton will eventually win.”",1109,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/25/lance-armstrong-david-millar-cyclists-union-cpa

82,"Two motorists almost hit an elite ultra-endurance cyclist on the morning he was killed near Canberra during an extreme race. The respected rider was running second in the Indian Pacific Wheel Race on March last year when he died from massive head injuries after being hit from behind near Canberra . The vehicle was driven by Shegu Bobb, at the time, who told police he thought he had hit a kangaroo when he fatally struck Hall at During an inquest on Tuesday, witnesses gave conflicting accounts of Hall visibility on the morning he rode on the Monaro Highway. Joseph Spulak was moved to tears as he relived almost hitting Hall during his morning commute from Cooma to Canberra. British ultra-endurance cyclist killed almost instantly, inquest told “It could have been me. I could have hit him. I just couldn’t believe it,” Spulak said. He said despite having his high beams on, Hall “came out of nowhere” and didn’t appear to be wearing reflective clothing or strips. Ashley Crivici said he swerved to avoid Hall about minutes before his death after initially believing he had seen a deer. “It was the brightness of a candle,” he said. Truck driver Anthony Shoard said Hall was “so close” when he cut across him to make a turn at at an intersection near Michaelago, about south of Canberra. “He cut it very fine,” Shoard said. But other drivers remember seeing visible reflective strips on his arms and legs. Jennifer Perrin spotted Hall on her way to work in Canberra, saying while it was&nbsp; odd to see a cyclist on that stretch of the highway in the dark, he was wearing reflective strips. Anthony Maxwell also passed Hall that morning. He noticed the bicycle had a bright rear red light and a forward facing white light. Maxwell told the court he noticed reflective material on his legs, disagreeing that it could have been light shining off the cyclist calves.

Outside the court, Hall partner Anna Haslock, who has travelled from the UK to attend the inquest, paid tribute to the renowned endurance athlete. “Mike was a very experienced cyclist. He knew what he was doing,” she said. “I know he would have been doing everything he could to look after himself on that race.” She hopes his death will make roads safer for cyclists, but doesn’t believe the Fremantle-Sydney race was much riskier than riding to work.

83,"British ultra-endurance cycling star Mike Hall died almost instantly from massive head injuries when a driver with a provisional licence hit him at an inquest has been told. Shegu Bobb, from Cooma, who was at the time, was on his way to work in Canberra , Australia national capital, on March when his car hit Hall on the Monaro Highway in darkness at Known as one of the best ultra-endurance riders in the world, Hall was running second in the inaugural Indian Pacific Wheel Race – a single-stage unsupported event from Fremantle to Sydney.

Bobb was travelling at the speed limit of when he hit Hall, who was on the correct side of the road, which had a narrow verge.

84,"n July businessman Gerry Ryan was at the Tour de France. Observing the national flags etched on team cars as they whizzed past, the multi-millionaire was troubled by the absence of an Australian standard. Ryan turned to friend and former national champion John Trevorrow: “Surely we should be able to put our own team together.” Eight years later, the team conceived with that comment has made sporting history. On Sunday Mitchelton-Scott became the first Australian-registered team to win a Grand Tour , with Britain Simon Yates winning the Vuelta a España in Madrid. This achievement ranks alongside Cadel Evans’ Tour de France yellow jersey triumph as one of the most significant moments in Australian cycling. Mitchelton-Scott Matt White: ‘There unfinished business’ | Kieran Pender Grand Tour success was at once unexpected and agonisingly delayed. When Mitchelton-Scott first raced in the team lacked a general classification contender. This was by design – team management had concluded during recruitment that they lacked the funds and roster to acquire and then support a serious challenger at one of the three Grand Tours. The plan was to begin with stage and one-day race targets and slowly grow jersey-winning prospects of their own. But when Colombian rider Esteban Chaves finished fifth at the Vuelta, Ryan came to appreciate that his long-term aspirations were suddenly within grasp – well ahead of schedule. Chaves emergence coincided with the rise of Yates and his twin brother Adam, giving Mitchelton-Scott general classification options in spades. Then came the agony. Chaves took the illustrious Giro pink jersey in with two stages remaining, only to lose it the following day to ultimate winner Vincenzo Nibali. In May Simon Yates enjoyed two weeks in the Giro leader jersey, earning three stage wins in the process before cracking with just three days remaining. Twice Mitchelton-Scott had seemed destined for a Grand Tour victory; twice it eluded them. In the last kilometres of Saturday stage the team first victory at this rarefied level was ordained The third time would prove the charm. In Málaga at the beginning of the Vuelta, the team exuded an air of calm . When Yates took an early advantage over his rivals with an attack on stage four, he admitted “it wasn’t the plan, I got carried away”. The boy from Bury seized the red jersey on stage nine, before relinquishing it several days later in what appeared to be a tactical move. Sure enough it took him just two days to regain the lead, winning solo atop Alto Les Praeres. A minor time loss on stage notwithstanding, Simon Yates victory had never seemed in doubt. With brother Adam and Australian prodigy Jack Haig flanking Yates, Mitchelton-Scott replicated the Team Sky armada that has long dominated the Grand Tour circuit. In the last kilometres of Saturday stage the team first victory at this rarefied level was ordained. Nearest opponent Alejandro Valverde grimaced, faltered and was swiftly out of sight – the consequence of a few seconds’ pain confirming the result of a three week race. With Sunday final stage little more than a ceremonial procession around Madrid, it was that moment in the mountains of Andorra that saw Ryan vision reach its zenith. In cycling, success is always fleeting. Even a Grand Tour win is no guarantee of future prosperity. Since the departure of chemicals manufacturer Orica at the end of Mitchelton-Scott has lacked an external co-naming rights sponsor; Mitchelton Wines is a Ryan family company. While the team operates on a smaller budget than rivals Sky or BMC Racing, it still spends upwards of million per year. Ryan remains steadfastly committed to the team, but his generosity is not endless. Landmark win for Australian women cycling team in Giro Rosa Fortunately, Mitchelton-Scott are well-placed for more wins. At the Yates brothers are only now reaching their prime; Simon Yates won the Tour de France young rider jersey just last year. This gives the duo a physical advantage over ageing rivals Froome, Geraint Thomas and Richie Porte, all on the wrong side of Waiting behind the twins and Chaves, currently recovering from glandular fever, is a talented climbing duo. Haig and Lucas Hamilton have both been feted since emerging from the junior ranks in Australia. While general classification success may be some years off for Hamilton, Haig has enjoyed a break-out – both in his own-right and as Simon Yates right-hand man. Last year I spoke with more than a dozen past and present Mitchelton-Scott associates – from physiotherapists to riders to Ryan – to better understand the team rapid rise. Across hours of interviews, one comment stood out. “If or when we win a Grand Tour, I would sit back and be very proud of everyone in the organisation,” the team general manager Shayne Bannan reflected. “Of course it would be enjoyable at the time. But it will then be a matter of getting on with the job and looking for the next victory.” They may have made Australian sporting history on Sunday, but for Ryan and company this is just the beginning. Mitchelton-Scott are not going anywhere. “Sport,” Bannan mused, “has no finish line.”",857,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/18/mitchelton-scott-makes-history-with-first-vuelta-win-for-australian-team

Having worn the race leader maglia rosa for the best part of a fortnight, Yates finished more than seconds down on the Colle de Finestre on a day that paved the way for Froome come-from-behind success. “We all knew that Simon was capable of it,” added Wiggins. “To execute it was obviously another thing, but I’m certainly not surprised because he been knocking on the door for years. “We asked whether [the Giro] could have been the best thing that ever happened to him and I think it probably was because he learned from it and now he won the Vuelta.

87,"Should Lewis Hamilton go on to secure the world championship this year, his win at the Russian Grand Prix will be the only victory in a superlative season from which he will take no pleasure. His victory, ensured the moment Mercedes employed orders allowing him to pass his teammate, Valtteri Bottas , proved an ill-sitting success defined by the decidedly uncelebratory figures of the Mercedes drivers on the podium as well as their team below them. Hamilton has been explicit in the past in his desire for the team not to employ orders and was uncomfortable with their use in Russia after he took the flag in front of Bottas. “It is definitely a win on my list of wins that I am least proud of,” he said. “The strangest day I can remember in my career. I want to win the right way. As racing drivers we exist to win; if you tell us we can’t, it is like you are taking our life away. I would never wish it on someone else and I would never ask for it ever. I made sure in a meeting that they knew this is not how I want to win.” Lewis Hamilton wins the Russian Grand Prix – live! There was the expected disapproval that the distasteful spectre of team orders always provokes yet the decision was unsurprising. Team orders have long been legal in and Mercedes, aware of Ferrari strong challenge this year, were unwilling to leave anything to chance. It is an unedifying way for a race to be decided but it was both understandable and planned for. With Sebastian Vettel finishing third, Hamilton extended his title lead to points, a gain, as opposed to the three-point boost second place would have delivered. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, charged with returning a drivers’ and constructors’ title, was as ruthless as his board members would have wanted. “It deflating for drivers and for a team but there is a harsh reality also,” he said. “On a day like this you can extend the lead by seven points more in a championship that has been very tough and difficult at times, so you have to take it.” Hamilton echoed his rationale given what might still happen in the five races that remain. “The team were considering the car breaking down or losing two more engines,” he said. “We could lose the championship and that was their reasoning, hard as it is to swallow.” Esteban Ocon dilemma highlights the lack of chances for young drivers in | Giles Richards Ultimately Mercedes’ decision was brought about after they had been caught on the hop by Ferrari . With Bottas leading from pole and Hamilton and Vettel settling into second and third, the Scuderia took the initiative, sending Vettel into the pits for the undercut. The move worked and after Hamilton stop he emerged behind the German. Hamilton had to charge and he pressured Vettel, who locked up through turn Hamilton closed and made an effort to pass on the run to turn two. Vettel defended but was out of position and caught in turn four when Hamilton dived up the inside to retake the place. Coming back at Vettel had been at a cost of causing some blistering to his tyres. With the German still a threat the team opted to give Hamilton Bottas place, moving the Finn into a buffering position in front of Vettel. Bottas was visibly and understandably disappointed. He has yet to win this year and, with pole and leading the race, had done everything that might be expected of him. In Hungary last year, when he moved over for Hamilton, the British driver gave the place back when he could gain no advantage. The Finn may have hoped for a repeat but, with the title at stake, it was simply not going to happen. “Lewis is fighting for the drivers’ championship and I’m not,” Bottas acknowledged. “From the team point of view it was the ideal result today. Maybe not ideal for me but for the team, yes.” Vettel knows this was another stinging blow to his title hopes and, as he races for a team who have employed team orders brutally in the past, he was understanding of Mercedes’ decision. “Well done to both of them, they played together as a team very well,” he said. As the two Mercedes drivers faced the press afterwards he even came to their defence. “All the questions – I know you guys love controversy so therefore ask naughty questions to them as individuals, but I think in the position they are it a no-brainer what they did today. Maybe not all the questions are justified.” Certainly Mercedes will not lose any sleep as they head to the next round in Japan. If Hamilton does take the title, he will still have some exceptional performances to remember long after the discomfort of this one is forgotten but he will also remember he has cause to be thankful to Bottas. “Never, ever in my whole life has it been the way I’ve wanted to win a race,” he said. “I just want to shine it on to Valtteri. There are not many teammates who would do something like that.”",878,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/30/lewis-hamilton-wins-russian-grand-prix-mercedes-team-orders-sebastian-vettel
88,"Perhaps it was inevitable that Lewis Hamilton would finally prove fallible at some point this season and in qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix the very tiniest chink in his armour was revealed. In the grand scheme of the championship battle, though, he goes into the race barely inconvenienced. He was second to the pole position of his Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas , while, crucially, his title rival Sebastian Vettel was off the pace in third. Bottas two hot runs in to claim pole were superlative. The Sochi Autodrom suits his driving style, especially on maximising the exit from the medium-speed corners that dominate here. He scored his debut win last season in Russia, where he has never been out-qualified by a teammate. With the Mercedes proving exceptionally strong, Bottas pulled it all together when it counted. His first quick run was four-thousandths faster than Hamilton, who knew he had to improve. It was Bottas however who upped the ante with a track record of Hamilton responded and was three-tenths up in the first sector when he went wide at turn seven and abandoned his lap, leaving the Finn triumphant. “It a good feeling,” he said. “This has been a pretty good track for me and again I managed to get some good laps in qualifying and the car just felt really, really strong.” Hamilton had been quickest in the first two sessions of qualifying but admitted he had been struggling all weekend with the middle sector. He had to find more there and was honest in conceding he had gone just over the edge. “The middle sector was where I was slacking, as I’d call it,” he said. “I knew I had to push, so it wasn’t three-tenths it was half a second I needed to improve and so just over-egged it a little bit.” Hamilton leads Vettel by points in the world championship and the onus is very much on the latter to win this race but the Scuderia have been found wanting. Mercedes, however, have gone from strength to strength in Sochi. Both teams brought aero upgrades here but Vettel still could not challenge. He ended half a second down on Bottas, an eternity on a track where the frontrunners will all run the same one-stop strategy. The German said it was the best Ferrari could achieve. He was on pole last year but was beaten through turn two by Bottas starting from third and his best hope on Sunday is to return the favour on the opening lap after which overtaking is going to be very difficult. Should both Mercedes make a clean getaway, the team will have to address whether to maximise the damage to Vettel by instructing Bottas to cede his place to Hamilton. The incentive to do so is strong. A Hamilton win to a third for Vettel would yield a gain as opposed to the three points second and third would deliver. For the moment Bottas, still looking for his first win of the season, wants to convert pole. “My approach is definitely just trying to win the race,” he said. “You can’t have any other goal, starting from the pole, but of course we’re here as a team.” The team principal, Toto Wolff, said that team orders were under consideration. “It going to be difficult to tell him you are not allowed to race after getting it on pole,” he said. “We will have a conversation tomorrow morning and then see how the race is going to pan out.” Kimi Raikkonen was in fourth. The Force India of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez were in sixth and eighth, Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean finished in fifth and ninth for Haas, with the Saubers of Charles Leclerc and Marcus Ericsson in seventh and Both Red Bull had taken new power units and starting from the back of the grid the team opted to save their tyres, not taking part in with Max Verstappen in and Daniel Ricciardo in Alongside Ricciardo and Verstappen, Toro Rosso Brendon Hartley and Pierre Gasly, and McLaren Fernando Alonso all received grid penalties for multiple power unit replacements. They will start from the back of the grid in the order they were taken: Alonso in front of Ricciardo, Verstappen, Gasly and Hartley.",714,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/valtteri-bottas-pole-russian-gp-lewis-hamilton
89,"Sebastian Vettel may be approaching the Russian Grand Prix as simply another step in his title challenge yet, if that challenge is not to collapse around him, he cannot afford to put a single foot wrong when it matters this weekend in Sochi. There is more at stake than maintaining pressure on Lewis Hamilton . Vettel badly needs to reassert himself to prove he has a credible chance of staying in the fight and ensuring he is in a position to take advantage should Hamilton fail to finish a race before the championship is decided. Hamilton leads Vettel by points on the back of four wins from the last five races and a series of errors that have punctuated Vettel season. The Ferrari driver can afford no more. Six races remain, enough for the German to take the title if he wins and Hamilton is second in all of them. It is an already unlikely scenario but for Vettel, who has enjoyed the quicker car since the mid-period of the season, the win he requires is needed as much to show he can still put Hamilton under the cosh as it is to keep the title arithmetic ticking over. He insisted the championship is not yet lost but that he must perform to his full potential at the Sochi Autodrom. “You never know what happens but anything is possible,” he said. “I’m not aiming to win all six races. First of all, I’m aiming to win here, then once that done we go to the next one and the next one. I don’t think there much point looking five, six races ahead. I think you’re much better off staying in the moment at what lies in front of you.” Lewis Hamilton refreshed and ‘stronger than ever’ for Russian Grand Prix The first critical moment is qualifying. Last year Ferrari locked out the front row with Vettel on pole but he was beaten through turn two by Valtteri Bottas, who went on to win . It proved to be the vital pass. Indeed it was the only on-track pass of the meeting and similar overtaking difficulties are expected on Sunday. The track in Sochi is low on tyre degradation and it will almost certainly be a one-stop race. Hamilton has suggested that the pace advantage required to pass will be up to seconds – a gap unattainable with drivers on similar tyre strategies. Pole will be key and Ferrari are aware their driver has no breathing room. They have brought a major aero upgrade to Russia, including a revamped front wing. But they, too, have to execute ruthlessly. Failure to do so in qualifying at Monza and Singapore put Vettel on the back foot. Vettel and the Scuderia have been found wanting but the German seems to be wearing the pressure well. He is aware that he can control only his performance but perhaps his greatest difficulty is that Hamilton will be making that task as hard as possible. Mercedes’ team principal, Toto Wolff, told how relentless Hamilton pursuit of the title remains. “He the only driver I’ve ever heard saying: ‘I haven’t driven well. First we have to look at my driving and then we look at the data.’ This constant drive for perfection happens every year,” Wolff noted. Always strong in the second half of the season, the British driver has been in imperious form, buoyed by how well Mercedes have been performing of late. He referred to “the great rapport in the team, the effort that gone in” and “the results we have produced considering we have started weekends on the back foot or slightly behind, yet performed better over all”. Vettel knows, then, that he must triumph in Russia while Hamilton, who has won at Sochi twice before, is aware he holds all the cards and can play the percentages. “The stakes are as high as they have ever been,” he said. “The money is in the middle of the table, every weekend is a gamble and the risks versus rewards you take means different things.” Vettel was quickest in first practice, with Hamilton in third. In the afternoon session Hamilton and Bottas took a one-two, with Vettel in fifth but with Ferrari expected, as has been the case all season, to dial-in their car on Saturday morning.",721,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/28/sebastian-vettel-russia-lewis-hamilton-sight
90,"Lewis Hamilton believes he is stronger than ever as he prepares for the Russian Grand Prix this weekend. The British driver goes into the race with a advantage over his title rival, Ferrari Sebastian Vettel, and is confident he and Mercedes will prove competitive in Sochi. Lewis Hamilton wins Singapore Grand Prix to extend lead in title race Six rounds of the world championship remain and Hamilton goes into them firmly on the front foot. He has won four of the last five races and comes to Russia on the back of a dominant win at the last round in Singapore , after which he took a break which proved beneficial. “I feel healthy, happier and stronger than ever,” he said. “It still feels like it has been a long year. But I have had plenty of time to myself, and some really good quality time with family, so I do feel really good for this last stint.” Hamilton is attempting to secure his fifth title, and fourth with Mercedes, but he emphasised that he was still constantly pushing his team. “We are all stuck in our ways, it is hard for us to change,” he said. “When you work with engineers it is similar and breaking patterns and moulds and challenging people, that what I live to do. I am a pain in the arse to my engineers, because I am always challenging. I like to think it has a positive impact to spring an idea or a direction to push the car.” Last year the Russian Grand Prix took place early in the season and Hamilton struggled with performance, particularly in working his tyres, and finished fourth. Now he is more confident. “I believe this weekend we will be in a better position than we were last year,” he said. “Our understanding of the tyre is far greater than last year but it still a challenge.” Vettel could still take the title if he won and Hamilton was second in all the remaining races and in Russia he insisted he was focused on keeping the fight alive. “I think it very simple from where we are,” he said. “We are some points behind and we need to catch up to make sure we stay there. “That our target and the best way to do that is to finish ahead, and ideally ahead of everybody. So the plan doesn’t really change. Obviously at this point we try to give it everything we have and I still believe that we have the chance.”",423,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/27/lewis-hamilton-refreshed-stronger-russian-grand-prix
91,"here is a sense going into the Russian Grand Prix this weekend that, for the short term at least, it is the last-chance saloon for Esteban Ocon. The talented young French driver revealed this week he is in talks with Williams for a potential seat in If he does not secure the drive he will almost certainly be out of Formula One next year. Much as young driver programmes are proving invaluable to making it through the ranks, on a partisan grid they can come back to bite you. Ocon drives for Force India in his second full season in Before claiming the title in he was taken on as part of Mercedes’ young driver programme. At Sochi in some of the team were already expressing huge admiration for his talent. With a string of good performances under his belt he was clearly being groomed for a seat at Mercedes. However, circumstances and a volatile driver market turned what had been a smoothly proceeding career on its head. With Force India going into administration and then being bought by a consortium led by Lance Stroll father the future became complex. Ocon teammate, Sergio Pérez, who brings funding, is expected to remain at Force India and to be joined by Stroll from Williams for Lewis Hamilton soars in Singapore but Sergio Pérez plumbs the depths Mercedes were already in negotiation to place Ocon at another team as early as July. The team principal, Toto Wolff, said there were two offers, understood to be from Renault and McLaren. Then Renault shocked the paddock by signing Daniel Ricciardo from Red Bull and McLaren chose to take on Carlos Sainz and promote their reserve driver Lando Norris. An unhappy Wolff referred to it as “politics, hidden agendas and lies”. But for Renault, claiming Ricciardo to race alongside Nico Hülkenberg was a statement of intent that matched their ambition. “We have Renault drivers,” the team special adviser Alain Prost said. “Drivers not owned by Red Bull or Mercedes. So we don’t hear on the TV: ‘This driver is on loan to Renault.’” For Ocon, it left few avenues open and that issue of him being a Mercedes driver did not help. Ferrari have settled their squad with Charles Leclerc joining Sebastian Vettel, and this week their relationship with Sauber put Antonio Giovinazzi alongside Kimi Räikkönen for Red Bull have confirmed Pierre Gasly with Max Verstappen and there is no room at the inn with sister team Toro Rosso. Their motorsports consultant, Dr Helmut Marko, recently said a driver with a Mercedes contract would probably not even be considered for the two potential seats at Toro Rosso. Mercedes have Valtteri Bottas under contract until the end of while Haas, who have a technical relationship with Ferrari, are expected to confirm an already decided lineup that includes Kevin Magnussen shortly. Factors that will determine the destiny of the Formula One title Which leaves the only seats remaining at Williams and that is far from clear-cut. Sergey Sirotkin brings funding to the team and his Russian countryman, Artem Markelov, who also brings backing, has been connected with a potential seat, while they also have Robert Kubica poised to make a return. Ocon and Mercedes’ position is further complicated by the wealth of riches they boast. Britain George Russell is the team reserve driver and leads the championship. He displays huge promise and has also been in discussions with Williams. Claire Williams has said they will not become a partner team to a manufacturer but an arrangement is conceivable to take one of the two drivers based on an engine and gearbox deal with Mercedes at an advantageous rate. Wolff has floated the idea of teams running three cars to increase the volume of seats for young talent because of the specific problem for Mercedes. “If you’re lacking either a partner team like Red Bull has with Toro Rosso or contractual relationships like Ferrari has with Sauber, Haas, then it very difficult to find the right place for young drivers,” he said. He has referred to playing “the long game” with both his drivers – the other, of course, being Lewis Hamilton – and stressed that Ocon and Russell are at different points in their careers. Which suggests that he would rather put Russell in a car now and that the likelihood is Ocon will be a reserve driver next year, after which he could be considered for Bottas seat. But having a talent such as Ocon sit out a season is far from ideal. It is made worse by the weight still attached to bringing funding, as Stroll and Pérez do. Wolff has ruled out trying to outbid other drivers’ backers to put his charges in a car. A scarcity of seats is nothing new in of course, and Ocon may yet be on the grid in but if he is not it would be a real shame and further indication that perhaps the owners Liberty could address a broader issue – that of making the sport cost effective for new teams, where the champions of the future can learn the ropes. Wolff is convinced Ocon would be able to prove his worth, given the chance. “One day he is going to be in a Mercedes and win races and championships and show all the others out there that they made a mistake,” he said.",897,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/27/esteban-ocon-dilemma-lack-chances-young-drivers-f1-mercedes-force-india
92,"Ferrari found wanting A weekend that had begun with such optimism for Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari ended with the team and driver bearing the demeanour of the defeated. They should have done better. Vettel had hit the wall in ending his session. He insisted it made no difference to his preparation but crucially second practice was the only one run in exactly the same night conditions as qualifying. Lewis Hamilton pointedly noted that small events have ramifications and he was right. The race might have been different had Vettel been on pole but, forced to go aggressive, Ferrari strategy failed. The undercut did not work, he hit traffic and he was on the wrong tyre – losing second to Max Verstappen. The title looks as if it has gone and the Scuderia increasingly appear to need a comprehensive overhaul. Vettel can deliver but he needs the car and sharp minds on the pit wall that have been missing of late. Lewis Hamilton ‘going from strength to strength’ after Singapore win Hamilton takes the breath away Hamilton has put in some extraordinary performances to take the lead he now enjoys over Vettel. He has been open in his desire to improve his qualifying and he proved in the wet in Hungary and Belgium just how well it has gone. But nothing has quite demonstrated his mastery of the single lap as the run in Singapore. Mercedes had done well to improve their car performance on what was considered a bogey track for the team but nothing prepared them for where Hamilton took their machinery. Pete Bonnington, his race engineer, summed up the remarkable reaction in the garage as Hamilton pumped in a series of unprecedented sector times. “You were impressed by the silence,” he said. “There wasn’t a lot of jumping. It was a lot of jaws hitting the floor, to see a gap like that.” The superlatives flowed deservedly and bear repeating – this was a driver on a different level altogether. Pérez makes for painful viewing Force India Esteban Ocon can be forgiven for questioning the slings and arrows as he contemplates what is looking almost certain to be a future out of next season, while his teammate Sergio Pérez retains his drive. On the evidence of Singapore, a ride justified largely by the backing he brings. Pérez opened poorly, squeezing his teammate into the wall at turn three. The Mexican protested his innocence and the stewards deemed it a racing incident. The team principal, Otmar Szafnauer, however squarely blamed Pérez. “There wasn’t any room, Checo [Pérez] should have given him room and Checo had plenty of room,” he said. Worse followed as, frustrated at being held up by the Williams of Sergey Sirotkin, he swerved into the Russian between turns and He was given a drive through penalty but it could have been worse. As a showcase for the “pinnacle of motorsport” this was a pitiful display. Max has mighty meeting Perhaps overshadowed by Hamilton superlative weekend, Max Verstappen put in a performance to remind everyone of just how good he can be when his judgment is spot on. He was suffering with engine mapping problems all weekend but drove an exceptional lap to take second on the grid, three-tenths up on Vettel. In the race he matched it. Vettel came at him off the start and, when the German made a superb move round the outside of turn seven on the opening lap, there was no clumsy defence. Verstappen gave him just enough room to make it and to Vettel credit he did. The Dutchman stayed focused, however, and pumped in the laps to ensure he was in front again after his pitstop. With track position he flew ahead and secured a fine second place. This was the performance that underlines his potential future world champion credentials and a world away from biffing Valtteri Bottas at Monza. New cars by dope demand sporting director, Ross Brawn, made the schoolboy error of showing the proposed designs for new cars to a behind closed-doors seminar in Singapore, forgetting of course that the pictures would be captured on phones and posted all over social media soon after.

The designs he believed would enable cars to lose only of downforce when in proximity to one another.

93,"Lewis Hamilton believes he and his Mercedes team are in the best possible position to close out the Formula One world championship after his win at the Singapore Grand Prix . The British driver took a dominant victory from pole position and his title rival Sebastian Vettel could manage only third, ensuring Hamilton now has a lead with just six races remaining. Lewis Hamilton wins Singapore Grand Prix to extend lead in title race Ferrari were expected to be on top at the Marina Bay circuit and they were until Hamilton put in an exceptional lap to take pole. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described it as “stardust” and the best lap he had ever seen. Hamilton and Mercedes followed it with a perfectly executed race that Ferrari could not match, with their aggressive strategy unsuccessful and Vettel unable to challenge. Hamilton has now won four of the last five races and the four-times world champion believes he can keep the momentum going. “We are going from strength to strength in terms of our understanding of the car,” he said. “We are far more comfortable at our job now. Six races ago we were struggling, trying to find that bit of magic, but we have now figured the car out.” He is now firmly on the front foot to win his fifth title. If Hamilton secured second place at the remaining meetings, Vettel would have to win them all to be champion. However Hamilton insisted the aim was to seal the championship as soon as possible. Alain Prost: ‘Getting Renault back on top is so difficult I find it interesting’ “The focus is intense. It has to remain the same if not more. We don’t have to change our approach,” he said. “I need to win every race and I focus on that. I arrive wanting to win. “There will be weekends when we know we will be comfortably stronger, and weekends like this when we know we will be behind but we will still try to win. I didn’t think we would have advantage. But it not the&nbsp;end.” Vettel hit the wall at Marina Bay in practice, ending his running for the session, one of a series of costly errors the German has made this season Hamilton identified as having made a difference. “Vettel damaged the car and lost running that not us lucking in,” he said. “I take a lot of pride in making sure I do not put myself in those positions. It is only small percentages that you get wrong and they have bigger ramifications.” Before the weekend began Hamilton had been flying around the world to launch his Tommy Hilfiger clothing range and he had faced questions over whether it was a suitable way to prepare. His results in Singapore he believes emphatically answered them. “The balance that I have in my life, in general is really good. I am glad you have seen this,” he said. Wolff backed his driver. “He was in Shanghai on the cat walk, in New York a couple of days later and he came, rock and roll, and blew everybody away,” he said.",525,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/17/lewis-hamilton-singapore-strength-to-strength-f1

95,"In indomitable form, there is now a relentless, intimidating quality to Lewis Hamilton driving that seems to simply brook no dissent. His win at the Singapore Grand Prix was the culmination of a weekend when he put together moments of almost transcendent skill and a ruthless execution when it mattered that was untouchable. Reminiscent of Tiger Woods at his peak, Hamilton performance for Mercedes under the lights of Marina Bay looked a class apart from his rivals. So much so that he now has one hand on the title. Lewis Hamilton wins the Singapore Grand Prix –&nbsp;live! Going into the meeting this was supposed to be Ferrari race. With his title rival Sebastian Vettel only able to finish in third behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen, Hamilton leaves Singapore with a lead. Mercedes managed his race impeccably and Hamilton has now won four of the last five. Only six races remain, Ferrari have a mountain to climb and Vettel self‑flagellation and dissatisfaction with their strategy this weekend suggests they are reeling and have no answers to Hamilton performances. The British driver had nailed an extraordinary lap to take pole. The team principal, Toto Wolff, called it he best he had seen and with track position on the narrow street circuit paramount it was crucial. After holding first place into turn one, he was able to lead from the front, dictate what was ultimately an unspectacular race and maintain serene control for his career victory. Yet given Ferrari form in Singapore it was still a win against the odds. “We knew that they would be spectacular here this weekend and so it was going to take something quite special for us to leapfrog them,” he said. “I know that not a single member of the hierarchy, like [strategist] James Vowles or Toto probably, really didn’t think that was possible – maybe more of them. So it was really quite a monumental moment for us as a team.” Leaving with an even bigger advantage over Vettel had certainly not been what the team were anticipating. “Definitely didn’t expect to come to Singapore with points more,” he said. “Definitely not. But I’m very grateful for those points and for all the hard work the team have put in.” Mercedes had indeed done a sterling job to produce a car that was more competitive at a circuit where they have traditionally struggled, as acknowledged by the technical director James Allison. “There has been a slow improvement of our performance,” he said. “We have been chipping away at it for months and it is a delight. Lewis got the job done but we gave him a car he could do that with.” Vettel downcast demeanour in contrast reflected a Ferrari squad who were left wanting. They still have the quicker car yet are failing to exploit it and the German is becoming frustrated as the title looks to be slipping away. He was critical of their strategy in qualifying where he managed only third and then also of the race. He had passed Verstappen for second place on the opening lap but the team early pitstop in an attempt to undercut Hamilton did not pay off. He emerged behind a Force India and had fitted the ultrasoft tyres. Once Verstappen, who drove superbly for second, passed him through his pitstop, Vettel was on the wrong rubber and his challenge was effectively over. “With the way we raced today we didn’t have a chance.” Vettel said. “I said before the weekend we could only beat ourselves and I think today we didn’t get everything out of our package. Alain Prost: ‘Getting Renault back on top is so difficult I find it interesting’ “It was clear we were not fast enough in the race, we need to understand why. It largely due to how we decided to race and which tyres for how many laps. What we tried to do was get to first position and get ahead, but Lewis was too quick.” Vettel did insist that his team had done the right thing in going aggressive – they had been forced to by Hamilton qualifying lap – and insisted he would always “defend his team” but he will doubtless be requiring an extensive debrief in to just how the weekend got away from him. Hamilton, however, was on a roll of both confidence and momentum and was understandably optimistic that he is in a position to close out the title. “I’m really happy with it. Still lots of points available but with this performance, and this focus that we have as a team, I truly believe that we can deliver impactful weekends like this for the rest of the season. So that the goal.” Hamilton has signed a contract until the end of and last week suggested he was encouraged by the look of the proposed cars for to continue racing on after then. The victory has put him behind Michael Schumacher record of race wins. A fifth title already looks to be well within his grasp but after this weekend and on such form, even this once seemingly insurmountable target has begun to look achievable.",861,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/16/lewis-hamilton-wins-singapore-f1-grand-prix
96,"t is striking how short silences punctuate Alain Prost replies, pauses during which it is impossible not to be caught by the steely gaze of his grey-green eyes. Behind them, sharp as ever, he considers every answer. Here, then, is “the Professor”, bringing the same thoughtful analysis to the table that he brought to the track and his four world titles – experience from which the Renault team are now benefiting after they presented Prost with a challenge he has enthusiastically embraced back at the heart of “When I find an interesting challenge with an objective and it good for you, your personal life, the brain, why not? I am very happy,” he says. Charles Leclerc looks like a gamble by Ferrari – but he not | Giles Richards In the paddock the remains instantly recognisable. Lean and fit, only the absence of the shock of brown curls betrays the years it has been since he won his last title and retired in Prost is quietly spoken and considered; he has, after all, nothing to prove. Yet there is an unmistakable determination when he discusses his role as a special adviser to Renault in their attempt to become world champions again. Prost took his titles in and for McLaren, with the final championship for Williams. His career is often publicly perceived through the narrow prism of the rivalry with Ayrton Senna , a narrative that usually fails to acknowledge the growing friendship between them in the months leading up to the Brazilian death. Besides which it is but part of the story. Among the competitors in his grand prix victories were five teammates who had won or would win world championships. As well as Senna, Prost went up against Niki Lauda and Keke Rosberg and enjoyed magnificent rivalries with Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet. His thoughtful approach to racing, always looking for the best way to extract the most from his car, earned him the “Professor” sobriquet. He remembers how Senna would be working on qualifying and so he focused on race setup. Repeatedly on Sundays he would have the quickest car and the skills to use it, leaving his competitors in his wake. While driving he did not like the nickname but the character it reflects is just what Renault need. They won constructors’ and drivers’ titles in and with Fernando Alonso. In they sold their majority stake in the team but returned as a full manufacturer in Last year they brought in Prost with a remit to take a broad view, contributing to the team growth and reorganisation. As he puts it: “Every time I can see something that is needed then I am there.” When the manufacturer took over Lotus the team they had once owned were struggling to survive. Renault, however, were aiming at podiums within three years and to be fighting for the title by a target that was appealingly difficult for Prost. “I like a return,” he says. “If it was going to Mercedes today – they’re at the top – I don’t think I would have the motivation. Now it so difficult to get back to the top that I find it very interesting.” The team are fourth in the constructors’ championship and Prost admits their goals may take longer to achieve than hoped. “What is the real target? Is it to be champions in year five and go away because we have achieved the goal? Or is it we want to build the team to be one of the top teams and always a top team in the future? That my perspective – long term.” The process is well under way, including, Prost explains, having almost built a new facility at Enstone, in Oxfordshire, and at Renault Viry‑Châtillon factory, near Paris – part of a series of considered, careful steps. Hamilton and Vettel battle will be determined by skill not machinery | Giles Richards The pace has been interpreted as reflecting the team relative lack of financial weight in comparison with Mercedes and Ferrari. But it is an approach Prost believes has been an advantage. “We are not going to spend money unless we know that it is worth it. Mercedes and Ferrari may have a different philosophy.” The team made clear how serious they are last month by signing Red Bull Daniel Ricciardo to race alongside Nico Hülkenberg next season. The managing director, Cyril Abiteboul, described it as “a huge statement”. Prost insists it signals Renault ambition and that they are unafraid to spend when required. “Daniel is more expensive than other drivers,” he says. “When you need that to help the team we did it. Money is not a problem but it has to be justified. “We have two top drivers, maybe one of the best lineups in today. They are Renault drivers, not owned by Red Bull or Mercedes. It shows everybody outside and inside that we want to do the best, the right choices at the right moment.” The task ahead is further complicated by the changes is going through – all the more reason to embrace it with the same dedication he showed behind the wheel, the Professor explains with a smile. “Parts of the sport I don’t like but it doesn’t make me say: ‘Oh it not I like any more and I will go away.’ The challenge, it is part of life. You can’t have a perfect day every day.”",905,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/16/alain-prost-renault-back-top-difficult-interesting
97,"If there was a shadow of doubt that Lewis Hamilton is in the form of his life, he surely banished it under the floodlights of Singapore Marina Bay circuit on Saturday. His lap to take polemust rank not only as one of his best but perhaps one of the best of his generation. Such was the scale and import of his extraordinary performance, his team elation was tinged with a sense of disbelief. His Ferrari rival Sebastian Vettel, who could manage only third, was left similarly stunned, almost reeling from a result that seemed unthinkable when qualifying began and may yet prove to be a pivotal moment in deciding the title. “That lap started perfect and it just kept going,” the Mercedes driver said. “It felt magical. It felt like one of the best – if not the best lap I’ve ever done.” Factors that will determine the destiny of the Formula One title Hamilton leads Vettel by points in the world championship but Ferrari had expected to be strong in Singapore. They had been on top, their carwell suited to the slow and medium speed corners of the track. The indications from Mercedes were that minimising the points dropped to Vettel would amount to a positive race. Hamilton, however, was having none of it. He was right to describe the lap as magic and Vettel could be forgiven for thinking there was sorcery in the air. Hamilton pole on his first quick run in was a consummate piece of driving. Pushing to the limitwithout touching the walls that are ready to punish the slightest miscalculation is key in Singapore and Hamilton took his car to the edge through every corner. His recent laps for pole in the wet at Hungary and Belgium were superb but here he found time from nowhere. The one run was enough, no one came close even on their second attempts. He completed the lap in but it was the margin of his advantage that was telling. He was three-tenths ahead of Max Verstappen, who was second for Red Bull, and a huge sixth-tenths up on Vettel. The German is acknowledged as being very strong in Singapore but was made to look powerless. That it is Hamilton making the difference was inarguable; his team-mate Valtteri Bottas, in an identical car, was fourth almost seven-tenths back. “This track is epic. It is the most challenging circuit for us in the year, it is Monaco on steroids,” Hamilton said. “It is about pulling all the little bits you have found through practice and putting it together – of the time it doesn’t go right but that lap I didn’t have a wheelspin, I didn’t have a snap, the car was underneath me and I managed to maximise on every corner. I don’t remember one where I thought I could do more.” Mercedes clearly felt he had pulled off something extraordinary. Their race engineer, Pete Bonnington, called it “an epic lap” and the strategist, James Vowles, was left shaking his head in disbelief. The technical director, James Allison, was similarly moved. “It is difficult to put into words how it feels on days like this. It is overwhelming on so many levels,” he said. “It was a breathtaking performance by Lewis.” The team principal, Toto Wolff, said Hamilton is operating on another plane. “I can’t explain what happened on that lap,” he said. “He is such an exceptional driver, only he will know what he did. It just surreal.” Vettel was clearly unhappy with how Ferrari had managed his session. “The way we composed qualifying, I think it was difficult to get a rhythm,” he said. “I was struggling in I think other people did a better job. That including Lewis’ lap as an individual but also them as a team. “It didn’t go as smoothly as it should have been. It was not an ideal session, we should have done better. We had the ingredients and didn’t put it together.” Ferrari will be strong in race pace but Mercedes are confident their car has more to offer, and Hamilton is aware just what a blow to his rivals it would be if he leaves Singapore having extended his lead. “We knew the Ferrari and the Red Bulls would be hard to beat,” he said. “So this is an incredible moment for us to be on pole.” Kimi Räikkönen qualified fifth and the second Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo was sixth. The Force India of Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon were seventh and ninth. The Haas of Romain Grosjean was eighth with Renault Nico Hülkenberg",767,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/15/lewis-hamilton-singapore-f1-gp-pole
98,"The difference maker Lewis Hamilton leads Sebastian Vettel by points going into the final seven races of the season, a somewhat unlikely advantage given the strength of Ferrari car and hence far from insurmountable. There are points remaining and as things stand the Scuderia still hold the cards in performance. However the difference thus far has been Hamilton. He has proved time and again his ability to maximise the results from difficult situations and turn in impeccable runs when on top. Having been on the back foot – off the pace in Monaco, knocked back to at Silverstone and starting from in Germany – he ensured the damage was minimal, returning a third, second and win from the meetings. He has played the percentages with the calm confidence of a multiple world champion focused on the big picture. Continuing to do so will put all the pressure on Vettel. The Singapore GP will probably be a case in point. Mercedes expect to be behind&nbsp;Ferrari and Kimi Räikkönen was quickest in second practice in front of Hamilton, for whom limiting the points damage may already be paramount. Vettel however, simply must win. Lewis Hamilton says title remains his priority after fashion diversion Ferrari ahead of Mercedes Mercedes know they are still behind Ferrari in the development battle. The Scuderia enjoyed a straight-line speed advantage at the British Grand Prix, which Vettel won. Since then they have shown their power unit is stronger, particularly out of the corners and in qualifying. Vettel clash with Hamilton in Monza and Räikkönen blistering tyres prevented real comparisons of race pace in Italy but Mercedes believe Ferrari are still ahead. The team principal, Toto Wolff, has said they need to “turn the factories in Brixworth and Brackley upside down to extract performance”. An aero upgrade is expected before the end of the season but they have used their three power unit allocations. Should they need to employ a fourth specification engine to take the fight back to Ferrari it will come with penalties. The team thus need to bring everything they can to keep up without having to endure a start from the back of the grid. Bottas can play vital role In the car Hamilton has been almost entirely in control, Mercedes must match him on the pit wall and with not a little steel. The team have made two key strategy errors this season: a software miscalculation in Australia and not pitting under the VSC in Austria. But Mercedes’ decision to keep Hamilton team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, out in Baku proved inspired and in the last round their race direction was superb. Bottas was going long anyway at Monza but Mercedes then used the Finn position to slow Ferrari Räikkönen, to Hamilton advantage. The team will certainly need to show similar astute judgment and ruthlessness on the run-in. The team said they would consider switching Bottas to a support role for Hamilton after Monza and Wolff has admitted he is not confident Hamilton has enough of a margin. Vettel must take priority That Ferrari must put their weight behind one driver seems cut and dried. The team, who have employed team orders to notorious effect in the past, must now ensure every opportunity is given to Vettel. Räikkönen is still mathematically in with a chance but realistically the Finn prospects need to be&nbsp;sacrificed. Thus far the Scuderia have been insistent their drivers could race but it has been costly. In Germany they were unusually circumspect in telling Räikkönen to&nbsp;move over for Vettel. While at Monza allowing Räikkönen the tow from Vettel in qualifying because it was his turn was admirable, it ultimately proved detrimental to the German. Vettel has said he does not want team orders to aid his title challenge but he is the only driver in a position to deny Hamilton and if Ferrari are to take the championship everything, including Räikkönen, must cede to Vettel shot. Charles Leclerc looks like a gamble by Ferrari – but he not | Giles Richards Flawless finish required Ferrari could not match Mercedes’ development at this stage last season, now they are ahead. That Vettel does not have a lead can partly be attributed to the four errors he has made. Small moments of misjudgment cost him in Baku, France and Germany. At Monza, albeit with a loss of downforce from his proximity to Räikkönen and an understeering car, he was still culpable in hitting Hamilton. He did well to recover to fourth but it was points dropped. In Singapore last year a misjudgment off the grid caused the accident that took him out of the race and gave Hamilton an unlikely win – a turning point from which there was no recovery. Going into that race Hamilton lead was only three points rather than a similar mistake leading to a DNF now could put an end to Vettel hopes in short order. He has repeatedly proved he can extract the most from his car and at times has looked untouchable, particularly the wins in Canada, Britain and Belgium. Yet to take the title he must be flawless from now until the end of the season, as he acknowledged on Thursday in Singapore: “The biggest enemy is me.” Of which he was harshly reminded in after hitting the wall and taking radiator damage that ended his session.",891,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/14/formula-one-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel-singapore-grand-prix

On Tuesday, negative Twitter reactions to Venom –&nbsp; which have been charted by Buzzfeed –&nbsp;raised suspicions about their motivation on account of their similarly phrased critiques: Others combined attacks on Venom with plugs for A Star Is Born.

Hawking, whose memoir Travelling to Infinity was used as a source for James Marsh The Theory of Everything said that despite her pleading with producers to remain faithful to her book, inaccuracies were permitted in order to keep the running time to a minimum. “I knew if there were mistakes in the film that they were going to be immortalised, which they have been,” she said. Speaking at the Henley literary festival, Hawking added: “I found that very irritating and I didn’t want it to happen. Don’t ever believe what you see in films.” The Theory of Everything followed the couple life together, from their first meeting in until he left her for a carer years later. But Hawking widow has taken issue with the circumstances of that first meeting (in St Albans, not Cambridge; Jane was a schoolgirl rather than a student), as well as the film compression of events and characters. Jane Hawking: ‘There were four&nbsp;of us&nbsp;in our marriage’ Hawking took particular issue with what she felt was a glossing-over of the logistical difficulties which consumed much of her life, caring for both her husband and three small children, and frequently attending physics conferences abroad with them all. “The film really only shows that part of our lives in Cambridge,” she said. “Our many foreign travels were ignored altogether – for example, our honeymoon was spent at a physics conference at Cornell University in upstate New York. “I’m sorry to say that none of these extensive travels – with all the organising, packing for a family with a severely disabled member, transporting them, driving them, as well as the usual day-to-day care – really appears in The Theory of Everything. “I asked for a frenzied fast-forward version – even simply getting all the suitcases, wheelchair and passengers in the car to represent this aspect of our lives – but I was told this was not possible because of the time constraints.” When the film was first released, Hawking raised some concerns about “the compromises that one has to make for the film industry” and the fact “I didn’t seem to have any friends or relations at all”. But she also praised the performances and called it “a beautiful film”. Others took further issue with the adaptation and its apparent traducing of Jane role in furthering Stephen life and work. Michelle Dean wrote of her pity that the film had apparently failed to fully explore Jane thought processes in abandoning much of her own early academic ambition to support her husband. She also critiqued the “tidy” resolution of their romantic lives. “But instead of exploring that fascinating texture in a marriage, The Theory of Everything is hell-bent on preserving the cliche: it tells you that Jane Hawking quietly and gratefully parted ways with him when it became clear their affection for each other was a casualty of the strain. The movie presents the demise of their relationship as a beautiful, tear-soaked, mutually respectful conversation. “Of course that didn’t actually happen either. Jane book describes a protracted breakup that comes to a head in a screaming fight on vacation.”",547,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/03/jane-hawking-stephen-wife-attack-the-theory-of-everything
2,"f you’ve so much as grazed the reviews for Bradley Cooper full-hearted, grandly entertaining reworking of A Star is Born, you’ve witnessed a lot of critics racking their brains for suitably ecstatic synonyms for “revelation”, ideally in conjunction with some spin or other on the film title. The beaming recipient of these superlatives, of course, has been Lady Gaga , whose first big-screen leading role has been hailed as some kind of perspective-shifting force of nature: “We knew she could sing and dance and wear meat with some flair, but who knew she could act ?” (At this point, Golden Globe voters may remind us that they gave her an acting prize two years ago; critics will promptly hiss at them to pipe down.) Oscars who are this year early frontrunners? Gaga is very good indeed in the film, though some of the praise for her performance has misleadingly created the impression of a one-woman show. A Star is Born has always, in all its iterations, been an actors’ duet: just as out-of-the-blue pop star Ally (Gaga) is first enabled, then emboldened and, finally, given a cruel emotional education by dissolute country-gravel growler Jackson Maine (Cooper), it remains a song of female self-realisation that relies, admittedly none too progressively, on male anguish as its bassline. As with all aspects of his unfussily accomplished directorial debut, Cooper directs his glittering co-star with a sure, generous hand. But his own performance isn’t merely holding up his end of the bargain: it pretty damn spectacular in itself, an exercise in old-school movie star swagger with all its flayed masculine insecurities and frayed nerve endings exposed. Couple that with a credible bourbon-rock croon and arena presence, and his performance is as image-expanding in its own way as Gaga: it not the one that hogging the headlines, but it may be the rough, scarred heart of the film. If no one is calling Cooper work on screen revelatory, that because it isn’t. Anyone who been paying attention is long past being surprised by his unexpected transition from glib Hollywood dude-bro to leading man of sly, soulful conviction; the smarmy yuks of his star-sealing turn in The Hangover feel a lot more than nine years ago. Since then, he scooped up three acting Oscar nominations, each one well-earned. David O Russell rightly saw something agitated and unhinged behind the actor all-American lacquer, and tapped it to electric effect in Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle; Clint Eastwood, on the other hand, got Cooper to retreat into his muscular bravado, to brilliantly disquieting effect, as PTSD-raddled military marksman Chris Kyle in American Sniper. Cooper Jackson Maine sits somewhere between what Russell and Eastwood identified in him; at a variety of volumes, he become a go-to man for outwardly strapping, inwardly ruptured middle-American masculinity. He may be the least suave or sexy incarnation of the character through the film various versions; marked by a cold streak of damage that bubbles all the way up to his mottled pastrami skin — a subtly transformative triumph on the part of the makeup team — it a performance that perhaps shares more DNA with the ruined Nashville crooners played by Robert Duvall in Tender Mercies and Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart. (They both won Oscars; don’t be surprised if Cooper extends the pattern.) Duvall and Bridges are lofty points of comparison for an actor who, at one point, looked like he might have peaked playing Jennifer Garner dorky best friend in Alias. But Cooper, like Bridges in particular, is an actor who has grown more interesting the more he has worked against his golden-boy image, whether destabilising it as feverishly as in Silver Linings Playbook, or playing up the smoothness to sinister, even uncanny effect, as in Limitless. Both those films are unusual showcases for a Hollywood leading man, foregrounding his character mental health imbalances ahead of his charms and more stoic weaknesses. Cooper willingness to play such damage – not always nobly so, and straying into outright arsehole territory on more than one occasion – makes him a particularly screen idol, a Warren Beatty for the era that recognises and medicates toxic masculinity. And like Beatty, an actor whose varnished beauty frequently stopped him just short of warmth, Cooper transition into film-making allows him to control that complicated screen image in newly exciting ways. (It also telling that he inherited the Star is Born directing gig from Eastwood, who moved behind the camera to expand a tough-guy screen presence that other film-makers were less inclined to challenge.) He has already lined up a Leonard Bernstein biopic as his second directorial outing, handing himself the role of the brittle, sexually conflicted composer; you’d call it casting against type if Cooper weren’t already making his “type” such a fragile, fractured notion. His performance in A Star is Born feels like a complex summation of his career progress to date: a brooding study in traditional maleness, forced into critical self-examination. “Maybe it time we let the old ways die,” he keeps singing in a recurring refrain. Lady Gaga may be the film revelation, but it Cooper we’re invited to reconsider. A Star is Born is released on October",865,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/03/why-bradley-cooper-is-the-real-star-of-a-star-is-born
3,"The winner: Night School This year has delivered number-one hits with family comedies (such as Peter Rabbit) and action comedies (Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Deadpool but has until now failed to produce a straight-ahead comedy that topped the UK box office chart. I Feel Pretty , which landed in second place in early May, came closest. So Universal will be pleased to have nabbed the box office crown at the weekend with Night School , pairing proven box office star Kevin Hart with hot comedy talent Tiffany Haddish. The film began at UK cinemas with from cinemas – one of the lower grosses for a chart-topping film this year, it should be acknowledged. The number compares with a debut (and including previews) for Haddish breakthrough movie Girls Trip last year – on that occasion, she was the least familiar to British audiences of the four principal female stars, acting alongside Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah and Regina Hall. Hart was last seen in ensemble comedy Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, and before that he was paired with Dwayne Johnson in Central Intelligence. The last film where his name was the biggest draw was Ride Along co-starring Ice Cube, which began with in January The classy alternative: The Wife In what was a notably quiet week for new releases, Picturehouse Entertainment established The Wife as the major new arthouse title of the week – squarely targeting upscale and older audiences with this tale of the long-suffering wife (Glenn Close) of a feted novelist (Jonathan Pryce) as they travel together to Stockholm to collect the Nobel Prize for Literature. Grossing from cinemas, and including previews, The Wife scored the second-highest site average in the Top behind only Night School. Sony Pictures Classics, which has the film in the US, is mounting an Oscar campaign for Close, in which she will compete with the likes of A Star Is Born Lady Gaga, The Favourite Olivia Colman, Roma Yalitza Aparicio and Can You Ever Forgive Me Melissa McCarthy. The homegrown hit While The Wife is a film with a clearly defined audience in the UK, the same can be said for The Intent The Come Up . This prequel to The Intent is written, directed and produced by Femi Oyeniran and Nicky Slimting Walker – who also appear in the film alongside the likes of Adam Deacon, Ashley Chin, Justin Clarke (aka rapper Ghetts) and Dylan Duffus. While the first Intent was very modest at the UK box office, grossing just over the course of its lifetime, the more glossily executed follow-up – which extends the action from east London to Jamaica – benefited from a bigger push from distributor Vertigo. Gross after days is a very impressive with the film performing particularly well in London and Birmingham. The strong hold: A Simple Favour Declining more gently than any other film in the top is Paul Feig A Simple Favour , starring Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively and Crazy Rich Asians’ Henry Golding. Takings fell by a relatively slim from the opening frame – suggesting that the film is earning decent word-of-mouth among UK audiences.

6,"More than half of the hostile responses to The Last Jedi, episode eight of the Star Wars saga, were politically motivated trolling or the result of non-human bot activity, according to an academic paper published by a US digital media expert . Morten Bay, a research fellow at the University of Southern California (USC), analysed Twitter activity about the film and concluded that more than of posts are by “bots, trolls/sockpuppets or political activists using the debate to propagate political messages supporting extreme rightwing causes and the discrimination of gender, race or sexuality. A number of these users appear to be Russian trolls.” The Last Jedi Kelly Marie Tran speaks out against online bullying The supposed fan hostility to The Last Jedi is a well-known phenomenon, with actors such as Kelly Marie Tran experiencing extreme levels of abuse , and campaigns cropping up to lower the film rating on critics’ aggregators and fund a remake . However, Bay research indicates that not only are negative comments on social media about the film in a minority, but the “anti-Jedi” campaign has been designed to serve a wider political purpose. “The study finds evidence of deliberate, organised political influence measures disguised as fan arguments,” Bay writes. The likely objective of these measures is increasing media coverage of the fandom conflict, thereby adding to and further propagating a narrative of widespread discord and dysfunction in American society.” Bay analysed the accounts which had tweets aimed directly at Last Jedi director Rian Johnson for the seven months after the film opened on December He found that of users – less than a quarter – expressed a negative opinion of the film. After stripping out bots/trolls and users who had what he describes as “clear political agendas”, that figure dropped to Bay concluded that real fan hostility to the film is much less than has previously been reported. Did Russia fake black activism on Facebook to sow division in the US? Of this negative group, Bay established that were “likely politically motivated or not even human”. This included of posts by bots, by trolls or sockpuppets (of which half appeared to be Russian trolls), and close to by users with political agendas. The Last Jedi director, Rian Johnson, retweeted the paper , writing “what the top-line describes is consistent with my experience online”. He added: “And just to be totally clear: this is not about fans liking or not liking the movie – I’ve had tons of great talks with great fans online and off who liked and disliked stuff.

8,"feels like a long time ago. But Samantha Morton remembers it well. She was supposed to star in the Terry Gilliam film The Brothers Grimm, and yet she didn’t. The reasons were not the kind openly discussed in the film business of the But Morton discussed them. She talked publicly about the fact Harvey Weinstein had ordered Gilliam not to cast her. His reasoning was alleged to have been that men would apparently not “want to fuck that”. Morton talked about Weinstein and the episode to journalists. She talked to her peers. She told a newspaper six other women later refused to star in the film. “I just remember thinking, it a shame you behave this way. You’re older than me, you have this vast power. But if someone is bullying you, you have to do something, don’t you?” She pauses as if a thought had just struck her. “Maybe I was the first person to publicly answer him back.” Morton is in Atlanta, Georgia. In any given conversation, her saucer eyes suggest a dozen different moods – pensiveness, outrage, hilarity. Now, she mostly looks surprised to be here. She arrived in the US last month to join the enduring zombie saga The Walking Dead , the job coming out of the blue, too good a chance to say no to, even if it meant relocating her family (she has three children, aged four to Her time since has been consumed by the long days of high-end TV. The workload is its own bubble – she hasn’t had time to gauge the mood of the country off set. In a few days, there will be a red carpet season premiere in LA. “Chateau Marmont stuff,” she says. I last saw Morton a year ago, in a car park outside Newport County football club. It was drizzling. She was in south Wales making a low-budget British film called Two for Joy , directed by the young photographer Tom Beard. The role was the kind it often feels only Morton can play, a single mother upended by depression. Shooting in a house nearby, she lay in bed, dazed and helpless every time the camera rolled. The second a break was announced, she bowled out with a big kid grin and wave. “I’m not method,” she says now. “I come off set and I’m Sam. If we’ve got the shot, I’m a happy bunny. What not to smile about?” Two for Joy is impressive. But Morton is the ace – painfully alive, endlessly human. “Is the film good?” she asks. “Good. I thought it would be.” She hasn’t seen it? “Oh, I never watch films I’m in. It ruins them for me!” I ask why and she ponders the question. “Dunno.” A yelp of laughter. “It started off not liking how I looked. When I was little, it was a vanity thing. ‘Is that me? Is that what my lips look like? Ugh!’” These days, she says, she wouldn’t want to see what she was doing on camera. She doesn’t want to understand it. The cliche about actors is that they need constant reassurance. For Morton the drive feels different – the point is to work on her own terms, in her own way. “I like being on the outskirts. When I was younger and the chance came along to be, for want of a better word, a movie star, I declined. So with Weinstein, although I knew he was a bully, I wasn’t aware of the rest of it. I kept that world of his away from me.” She speaks slower now, double-checking every word. “I don’t know if people have noticed, but I have been very quiet about Harvey Weinstein, and very quiet about Me Too. And it not because I don’t care. It because I’ve cared about this since before I could speak. It very close to home.” Morton grew up in Nottingham in a series of care homes and with various foster parents. In her experiences shaped the one film she has so far made as a director, The Unloved . When it was released, she gave an interview to the Guardian disclosing that she had been sexually abused as a child. “It very simple. Sexual abuse is not something to ever be dismissed. If somebody says another person has done something to them, we listen. It is a duty.” In Newport, she was shooting Two for Joy in a cramped council house on the Alway estate. “I grew up in houses like that,” she says. Her history still informs her professional choices. Even on the blockbusters she takes, the kind that pay the bills – The Walking Dead or JK Rowling Fantastic Beasts – she tries to apply the same logic as with a film like Two for Joy. “I just think, can I do anything with this? Are the film-makers nice people? Not ‘nice people’, but people I can be vulnerable with.” For all her love of acting, she often talks beyond it, out into the real world. When she mentions her research before Two for Joy – demanding Beard specify the medication her character was taking, hitting Google to pinpoint the side-effects – I ask if she thinks attitudes to mental health have improved in Britain. “There is a dialogue about mental health now that there wasn’t for many years. But our government is completely devoid of understanding about what triggers mental health problems, which is poverty, debt, a lack of respect and dignity. Suicide rates among young men through the roof, single mothers demonised, young people mental health provision underfunded. It is disgusting. It is horrific.” For Morton, the subject cannot end there, bound up with wider problems, more affronts. In a furious monologue, she touches on Grenfell, school budgets, gambling adverts paraded before families watching the World Cup (“ITV, have you no shame?”), the ransacking of the NHS, the “clueless” treatment of Northern Ireland in Brexit negotiations. “And it all comes from the same root, which is a government I am mortified and embarrassed to see running our country. Has Theresa May got one scrap of genuine concern for what her policies do to ordinary people? No. They just do not care. And we feel so superior because we didn’t elect Trump! We’re hypocrites! It makes me judder.” She laughs, fleetingly. Did she find it a relief to get out of the Britain of “Yeah. Yes, actually. It was.” Morton is only but you can mistake her for having been around for ever. She started acting before she was in her teens, starter jobs in Soldier Solider and Cracker coming while she was living in care. She was still in her early when her signature roles arrived – Woody Allen Sweet and Lowdown, Steven Spielberg Minority Report, the title role in her friend Lynne Ramsay Morvern Callar. In there was an Oscar nomination for her turn in the New York immigration drama In America. Yet Hollywood and Britain both proved to have limited space for her talent. With her otherworldly presence, she was wrong for the underwritten wives that were still then the norm for female roles. And there was her “difficult” reputation. “Now there is more respect on sets for what I’ve done, but in my certain kinds of people said I was a nightmare. That I’d create problems.” Such as? “I was vocal about conditions on set. I’m political. I’m outspoken about the way child actors are treated. About the hours people have to work. I don’t accept grotty behaviour. I don’t accept the misuse of power. I’m a strong woman and they don’t like it. They’ve never liked it.” Fifteen years ago, talking back to Harvey Weinstein would not have helped. Fate brought other troubles. In she suffered a stroke after an injury sustained during a house renovation. The causes were myriad, the result that now, on the big screen, perhaps the most gifted film actor in the country juggles supporting parts in Fantastic Beasts with films so small they fall through the cracks. “A lot of films I do now, people never even know exist,” she says. Yet she is tickled by the idea there will be untold viewers seeing her for the first time in The Walking Dead without ever knowing she was once Morvern Callar. “I like that! I enjoy being a secret. Like the first time you see Dennis Hopper and then you realise he had this mindblowing career.” There are no regrets. “I made all my decisions with the best information I had available, so regret doesn’t come into the equation. Back in the how many amazing women were caught in the studio system? I am so lucky. I’m a working actor and I’m not owned by anybody.” In the mayhem of Morton is getting by. She is due back in Britain this year to film her last series of the TV show Harlots. Beyond that, she says, all bets are off. “England frightens me more now than it ever did under Thatcher. I just tell myself stay strong, Sam.” She smiles a huge cartoonish smile. “And don’t let the bastards grind you down.” Two for Joy is on release in the UK now.

9,"he year is and two California schoolgirls called Diane Feese and Sherry Forget are watching uncomfortably as their teacher wheels out a TV on a stand. Lessons are meant to be over for the day but, rather than let his students go home, Mr Schwartz is insisting the teenagers watch a movie. He pops a tape into the VCR. What follows is a parade of grotesque images. Dead bodies are sliced open in an autopsy, people at an occult orgy smear themselves in human blood, a man is electrocuted, sheep writhe on meathooks and there is an awful scene at a restaurant involving a monkey. “The people at the table,” says Forget today, “beat this monkey over the head with a hammer until it died. Then they cut the top of its head off and ate its brains.” As an animal-lover, she found the film deeply disturbing and asked to leave. Mr Schwartz said no and when Feese also tried to go, he forced her to sit down, grabbing her chair and spinning it aggressively towards the screen. They were watching Faces of Death, a film containing footage of humans and animals, either dead or in the process of dying, usually brutally. It opens with a pathologist, who introduces what follows as his own personal collection of clips gathered from around the world. “Over the years,” he proclaims grimly, “I have compiled a library of the many faces of death.” The documentary approach was what made the film so upsetting. “We went into the movie knowing this was real,” says Forget. “That was what was so weird,” adds Feese. “I was like, ‘Why are they filming this? Why are they doing this? What is wrong with people?’” In the years since its release, Faces of Death has earned a reputation as one of the most shocking films ever made. Even today, in the age of police body cameras and Islamic State execution videos, it retains its power. I tracked down Feese and Forget, whose families sued their high school , while working on a feature about Faces of Death for the podcast Snap Judgment . I’d heard rumours about the film while working on a project with John McNaughton, director of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer . I knew that MPI Media Group, the company that produced Henry, had distributed Faces of Death. I also knew MPI owners felt uneasy about the film. I started wondering how the director felt – and began hunting him down too, eventually finding him living with his family in Colorado, where he now runs a gun store. “It kind of cool to think that, you know, I actually created a cult film,” he says. Unlike the stone-faced doctor who introduces the movie, he laidback and affable, with a streak of blond left in his long grey hair. He insists on being referred to by his directing pseudonym, Conan LeCilaire, a name he picked in his because he thought it meant “Conan the Killer” in French. “It does not mean that at all,” he says now. “But in my brain at that age, I just thought it was clever.” Like Forget and Feese, LeCilaire is from southern California. His dad owned a nature film company and gave him his first job when he was He worked his way up to producer. One day in the a man from the Japanese film company Tohokushinsha showed up at LeCilaire office with a strange offer. He’d brought a print of a documentary called The Great Hunt, full of footage of animals dying. “People killing animals all over the world,” says LeCilaire. “Being taken for food, basically.” This was a “mondo” film, a genre of exploitation documentary popular at the time. Mondo films took their cue from the Italian film Mondo Cane , a compilation of travelogue vignettes – from tribal rituals in Africa to women in America using strange flesh-jiggling machines as part of a health craze. Mondo films often featured graphic scenes of animal slaughter. In the original, vengeful sailors shove poison sea urchins down a shark throat until it dies. LeCilaire said he was tired of doing films about animals. Why not do something about humans getting killed? “They were the first shockumentaries,” says LeCilaire. A big fan of Mondo Cane, he had been particularly struck by a scene that took place in a death house in China, where the sick and elderly were taken to spend their final days. When LeCilaire was meeting the man from the Japanese film company, that scene leapt into his head. He said he was tired of doing films about animals and wanted to try something more ambitious. “Why not do something about humans getting killed?” LeCilaire said. The man gave him a weird look – but he didn’t say no. LeCilaire was asked to put together a “sizzle reel”, a sample of his concept. He convinced a doctor friend to let him into a morgue, where he shot an autopsy, cutting it together with other graphic footage including seals being clubbed to death. When his prospective clients flew in from Japan, he took them into a screening room and showed them the results. “They just went batshit crazy,” he says, still gleeful. “They were so excited.” LeCilaire set about finding enough graphic footage to fill a feature film. He went to news organisations and purchased a shot of a woman jumping to her death from an apartment building, as well as the aftermath of several car accidents. He struck gold when an intern at a news company told him they had a tape in the back labelled “body parts”. But it wasn’t enough, and LeCilaire decided to shoot staged sequences. He and a writer came up with a list of fatal scenarios – alligator attack, electric chair, beheading – and added other elaborately disgusting sections, such as the monkey brains scene. He hired actors, booked locations, and a professional Hollywood crew shot the film in a little over a month. The great irony I found while making the podcast was how many of the most talked-about scenes in the film are fake – yet to this day, many viewers believe it all real. That said, many of the sections of genuine documentary footage – in particular, the grisly aftermath of a plane crash – are undeniably shocking. It taught me life wasn't flowery and pretty and nice – life was ugly. I took that and went with it When Faces of Death hit Japanese cinemas in under the title Junk, it was a massive hit. But the film real success came a few years later, thanks to a revolutionary new piece of video technology: the VCR. By there were players in the US alone, creating an unprecedented demand for content. A wave of violent horror films that came to be known as “ video nasties ” flooded rental stores. “And the most popular nasty of them all,” spat Chicago Tribune movie critic Gene Siskel, “is a piece of trash called Faces of Death.” The film VHS packaging certainly didn’t sell it short. “BANNED in countries!” it shrieked. In fact, Faces of Death may have only been banned in a few countries. The film was certainly illegal in Britain, where the distribution of video nasties was a criminal offence. But in the US, Faces of Death was unstoppable. In the Associated Press interviewed a then-unknown Quentin Tarantino , who was working as a clerk at a video store. He revealed that Faces of Death “is being rented out twice a week, which means it almost always out”. Steven Spielberg, meanwhile, paid tribute to the film with his own monkey brains scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Some video stores refused to stock Faces of Death and legislation was introduced in several states to keep it out of the hands of minors. Psychologists debated the film merits, warning it could “interfere with the development of children and their attitude toward death”. Feese and Forget, the schoolgirls who were forced to watch the film, echo this concern. Forget says: “Being hit in the face with images of death when you’re young and you don’t really have the faculties to manage that – I think that changes how you perceive those things.” When she finally went home that day in Forget went straight to her room. “It was as if someone dropped a dark cloud over me,” she recalls. That summer, she barely went outside. Feese told her parents about the film and they filed a lawsuit. Their families eventually split a settlement from the school. Evil people are going to commit their crimes no matter what The paths their lives have taken since seem curiously related. “I went through a phase where I had a huge morbid curiosity,” says Forget, who considered becoming a coroner, but ultimately went into the military. Feese, who became a paramedic, says the incident taught her a lesson: “That life wasn’t flowery and pretty and nice – life was ugly. And I took that and went with it.” In Rod Matthews, a old boy in Massachusetts, lured a classmate out into the woods and beat him to death with a baseball bat. He would later claim that he decided to kill someone after watching Faces of Death. Two other teen murders have been linked to the film, although the connections seem tenuous. At any rate, LeCilaire isn’t buying it. “Evil people are going to commit their crimes no matter what,” he says. “It makes me feel bad that [Matthews] said, ‘It was Faces of Death that made me do this.’ But do I believe that, if Faces of Death was not around, that would have stopped him from doing it? No.” When I press LeCilaire on this, though, he wavers. “I don’t believe it my fault,” he says, then pauses. “Maybe it is. I’d hate to think that.” Nothing, he adds, could have been further from his desire. “What was your desire then?” I ask. “To shock people,” he says.

10,"Nicolas Cage: most fearless actor of his generation or scenery-chewing joke? The debate rages on; rage being the operative word. Cage recently expressed frustration at being the object of viral internet mirth, specifically “Cage rage” memes, usually featuring the actor at his most wild-eyed in a still from Vampire Kiss (the one where he turns even a recitation of the alphabet into a maelstrom of thespian exuberance). Sign up to our Film Today email In the years hence, Cage has pushed at the frontiers of acting acceptability, even if that has meant opening himself up to ridicule: the YouTube supercuts of “Nicolas Cage losing his shit” and memes such as My Hair , for example. His latest movie, Mandy, won’t help. It features Cage suffering harrowing loss, undergoing torture, ingesting hallucinogens and going on the rampage against a biker death-cult. Mandy is a doom-metal symphony of stylised excess that only Cage could pull off. In Cage obsessive Ethan Hawke called him “the only actor since Marlon Brando that actually done anything new with the art of acting”, saying Cage had “taken us away from an obsession with naturalism”. His legions of fans (there is a dedicated Reddit thread that calls Cage the “One True God”) would agree. For comparison, there is a textbook example of “naturalistic” acting out the same week as Mandy: First Man , in which Ryan Gosling portrays Neil Armstrong as a glum, repressed type. Armstrong vacuum-sealed personality, First Man suggests, is part of what made him the perfect astronaut, but it has to throw in a lot of retro space action to keep things interesting. Perhaps “naturalistic” acting lends itself to modern blockbusters where the special effects take centre stage? Put Cage in a movie and he is the special effect. One of Mandy most memorable scenes is an unbroken take of Cage in his bathroom, in his pants, drinking half a bottle of vodka and morphing from grief-stricken victim into howling, chainsaw-wielding psycho avenger. That your next meme right there. Nicolas Cage: ‘If I don’t have a job to do, I can be very self-destructive’ Cage has likened his style to James Cagney in White Heat: “Was that realistic? Hell, no. Was it exciting? Hell, yeah.” To me, he one of a dwindling club of movie wild men whose members might include Nick Nolte, Jack Nicholson, Christopher Walken, possibly Joaquin Phoenix. Or, going back further, Brando, Dennis Hopper or Klaus Kinski. Did Werner Herzog ever make a decent fictional movie without Kinski in it? I can only think of one: Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, where the lead was … Nicolas Cage . These are actors who can never convincingly play “normal”, and the movies would be a duller place without them (and without over-the-top freakouts such as Mandy). You could say they’ve gone beyond the frontiers but, unlike Gosling Neil Armstrong, they remembered to bring something back.

11,"Nicolas Cage is the greatest American actor working today, full stop. Not very long ago, such a claim would have got you laughed out of the room. Only Cage superfans said such things; in the eyes of the rest of the world, well, sure, he could act – he did win the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, after all – but he was too eccentric, too laughably over the top, just too damn Cage-y to be taken seriously. Ever since I saw him in his comedies – Peggy Sue Got Married, Moonstruck and Raising Arizona – in which he played, respectively, a nasal-voiced teddy boy, an opera-loving baker and a cartoonish ex-con – I have been a Cage superfan. I had never seen anyone act like him before – wildly mannered but always heartfelt – and there was something about his fearless lurch towards the ridiculous to achieve something unique, and maybe even glorious, that struck me as inspiring. If actors were pop songs, Cage would be Bohemian Rhapsody. As a shy I would practise his grandiose speeches and even more grandiose gestures from Moonstruck in front of the mirror: “I ain’t no freaking monument to justice!” I would shout, lifting my arm to the sky. It felt exciting. But thanks to the endless schlocky horror movies he makes these days, coupled with all those internet supercuts compiling his notorious “Cage Rage” freak-outs from various movies (“Nicolas Cage Cagiest Moments!”), he is too often regarded as, if not exactly a guilty pleasure, then at least an ironic one. And it is hard to argue the genius of a man who fills his CV with movies such as Season of the Witch and Ghost Rider . But attitudes have been shifting. Ever since his magnetic performance in Werner Herzog Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans in re-evaluations have been written with headlines like Is Nicolas Cage Actually the Most Brilliant Actor of Our Time?, by journalists presumably too young to remember that Cage long ago confirmed this in movies such as David Lynch Wild at Heart. In a Reddit Ask Me Anything, Ethan Hawke confirmed that he, too, is a Cage superfan : “He the only actor since Marlon Brando that actually done anything new with the art of acting; he successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadors.” Cage and I meet on a sunny day in the restaurant of the Savoy Hotel in London. He is dressed formally in a grey suit and tie, but his face is friendly. “What with all this SUN? I was hoping for London fog and GLOOM,” he says in his distinctive, lilting voice. These days Cage lives in “well, the ROMANTIC way to put it would be the Mojave desert, but the CRUDE way of saying it is I live in Las Vegas”. He moved there a decade ago for, he quietly admits, the rather crude reason of Nevada not having any state tax, “which was helpful at the time”. Cage famously blew the fortune he made in blockbusters The Rock, Face/Off and Con Air on, among other things, some fabulously eccentric real estate purchases around the world, including a castle in Somerset. The castle has since been sold but he still has a cottage near Glastonbury, having been urged to check out the town by someone he describes as “my philosophy teacher”. “She thought there was something very ARTHURIAN about me – why, I don’t know – and I went and I fell in love with the place. Glastonbury town is like walking into a pack of TAROT cards: on the one side you have very ancient Christianity, on the other side you have pagan book stores, and someone barking about God in the middle of the street. It like an Ingmar BERGMAN movie, and I love it,” he says. He has two chunky rings on his fingers: a block of Tanzanite from Somerset and a tiger from Vegas, “So I always have Glastonbury and Las Vegas with me,” he says, smiling fondly at this hand. We are here today to talk about his latest film, Mandy , directed by Panos Cosmatos, and if your impression of Cage these days is of someone who squanders his talent in niche horror movies most people won’t see, well, Mandy will not change your mind. Cage is incredibly watchable as the devastated lumberjack, Red, who sets out to avenge the death of his girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) at the hands of a cult leader (Linus Roache). But Adaptation it is not. Does he do these smaller movies because they give him the space to experiment with his, shall we say, unique style of acting? “Absolutely. I like to break forms, try different things, and I don’t think studios are comfortable with that. But in an independently spirited film, I can do that. Also, if I don’t have somewhere to go in the morning and a job to do, it can be very self-destructive. Then I’m just going to sit and order two bottles of red wine and dissolve, and I don’t want to be that person, so I have to work,” he says. After this interview, he says, he has to learn lines for three upcoming films. Perhaps it is this work ethic that has kept him so healthy. Unlike most other actors who have been around for four decades, and despite his reputation as a man of extremes, there have never been any substance-abuse scandals or allegations of burnout. “I certainly have a work ethic, that I will say. I’m the first to arrive and the last to leave. But also I think my children are to thank for that. When you’re a father, you can’t behave like that,” he says. Cage has two sons: Weston, from an early relationship; and Kal-El (the name Superman was given as a baby), from his third marriage to Alice Kim. Because of his son name, I tell him, there an online campaign to make him the next Superman. “Oh, I think my Superman days are long gone,” he laughs with a little pat of his belly. He would be an amazing villain in it, I reply. His eyes light up. “Oh, that would be GREAT! I’d make a great Lex Luthor!” For all its hilariously over-the-top gore, Mandy is really about a man grief at the loss of the love of his life, and right before the film started shooting, Cage marriage to Kim came to a sudden end. “It was a shocker for me – I definitely didn’t see it coming, and those feelings had to go somewhere, so they went into the performance,” he says. Have he and Kim managed to stay friends? “Oh yes, I want to. She was quite young when I married her and I don’t really have any ill will towards what happened. That all I’ll say,” he says, looking genuinely stricken. “And now it like, wow, I’m and I’m single again – I didn’t see that coming! It pretty grim.” Presumably he can’t really do Tinder. “No, definitely not. I’m not on social media, but everyone else is so I’m like, well, what do I do?” His moves might also need some work. When a female friend was over at his place recently, he showed her Vampire Kiss, his too-little-known horror gem about a man who believes a one-night stand has turned him into a vampire. “I think it scared her. She left,” he says, laughing. It not really a great date movie. “No, maybe not!” It is often said that Cage doesn’t look like a movie star, but he actually does look like lots of movie stars, just from different eras: he has the long face and nose of Max Schreck in Nosferatu, the high forehead of Werner Krauss in The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, and the wild, bug eyes of Klaus Kinski. These are the very actors Cage always wanted to be like, having grown up watching them with his beloved father, Augustus Coppola, who made sure his son was grounded in the classics. He tries to bring the lessons he learned from those films into his own movies; even the hand gestures from Moonstruck that I used to copy were a reference to Fritz Lang Metropolis. That might sound laughably pretentious, but there is something refreshing about someone from the American film industry who doesn’t think film history means only Frank Capra movies or, a la Tarantino, old Jackie Chan or roadhouse films. “It true, I’m a throwback,” Cage nods. Does he fear looking ridiculous? “All I care about is the transformation so I never think: ‘Is this ridiculous?’ Even though” – he laughs – “sometimes it is!” His methods of getting into character are legendary: to prepare for Leaving Las Vegas, he hired the by then permanently drunk poet, Tony Dingman, to be his “drinking consultant”. “I think Mike [Figgis, the director] was a bit: ‘What are we doing?’ Because suddenly there was this drunk poet with me all the time,” he says solemnly. For Bad Lieutenant, he compulsively snorted saccharine to put him in the mindset of a drug addict. “I think I freaked Werner [Herzog] out a bit, which then freaked me out because you really have to have gone way out to freak out Werner,” he says. Cage various attempts to explain his acting style, using terms such as “German expressionist”, “western kabuki” and, my personal favourite, “nouveau shamanic”, haven’t done much to dispel the impression he is, at the very least, a little bananas. But today he talks about it with relative straightforwardness. “I can do photorealism, but I wanted to let it be known that acting can break forms and hark back to something else. I’m a big fan of artistic synchronicity, when you do one form in another, like Munch Scream in Ghostrider,” he says, pulling the aforementioned face. “Not natural but truthful, not crazy for craziness sake.” But it must be frustrating to aim for Munch and Kinski, only to be reduced to internet supercuts about Cage Rage. “It goes both ways. [The internet supercuts] kept me relevant to a generation that is entirely about YouTube. On the other hand, these larger-than-life facial expressions are made into something called memes,” he says, rolling the word “memes” around in his mouth disdainfully. “But I don’t have any umbrage about it. I’m going to give it my all every time, and I think people know that now,” he says. They didn’t at the beginning though, so how on earth did he convince his early directors to let him try things that look so, well, weird? “I was lucky. I had people who went along with me for the ride and, indeed, sculpted it with me,” he says. This is possibly not how the film-makers themselves saw it: the Coen brothers were so unsure about him, they made him audition for Raising Arizona times, and he was nearly fired from Moonstruck when he initially insisted on bringing in Jean Cocteau references. As for Peggy Sue Got Married, he admits: “I was lucky my uncle was directing it,” his uncle being Francis Ford Coppola. “But I think Kathleen [Turner, his Peggy Sue co-star] was amused. I think we were a little bit in love with each other, to be entirely honest,” he says. (Turner, I strongly suspect, would disagree with this take. In a recent interview , she was asked about working with Cage: “He was very difficult on set. The way I saw it, yeah, he WAS that asshole.”) Nicolas Coppola grew up in Long Beach, California, the son of Francis Ford Coppola brother, and from an early age, he idolised his uncle. “I was in awe of him and wanted his approval. I loved the way he lived his life, always listening to the Beatles and playing guitar,” he says. But when Cage started acting as a teenager, he quickly realised he would have to change his surname to avoid charges of nepotism. “Certain actors, whose names I won’t mention, would stand outside my trailer and say: ‘I love the smell of Nicolas in the morning!’ I thought, I don’t need this. So I changed it and I was free.” Whereas he changed his surname to get distance from his family, his then close friend Charlie Sheen – born Carlos Estevez – changed his surname to his father Martin Sheen stage name. Didn’t he think that was weird? “I did think about that, yeah. That is kind of amazing, isn’t it? Charlie is a great actor – he stole the whole of Ferris Bueller in a two-minute scene. He is somebody I always admired but I thought it fascinating that he took his father surname and his brother Emilio stuck with Estevez. Well, it certainly worked for Charlie!” Two of Cage three ex-wives also come from famous families: Patricia Arquette, with whom he co-starred in Scorsese Bringing Out the Dead, and Lisa Marie Presley. “I think I felt a connection there, an understanding of the pressure of having a famous name. One of the things Lisa loved about me was that I changed my name – she thought that was the coolest thing. But I don’t really count those two marriages, I don’t think they belong on my record. The real marriage for me was the years I had with Alice and the child we have together,” he says. Did Presley not find it strange that, before they married, Cage had dressed as her father onscreen twice, in Wild at Heart and Honeymoon in Vegas? “Oh no, I think Lisa really dug it! She liked Wild at Heart so much that she wanted to do a sequel. Maybe one day.”Cage and Presley are still friends, but he and Arquette haven’t talked “in a long time”. I ask if he thinks maybe the emotional extremes he goes to in his day job make it hard to have a relationship. “Maybe. I hadn’t really thought of it like that. But it true, you have to shut it off when you go home and I have a life – well, had a life ...” He still has a life, I say. “Well, I meant when I was married, coming home to that at night. But, yes, maybe it hard for people to be around.” It can’t have been easy turning off Charlie Kaufman every night, I say, referring to his performance as the neurotic, sexually frustrated screenwriter in Adaptation. “No! God! And I was married to Lisa then …” he trails off again. Cage career has gone from comedies to action movies to horror, with oddball classics like Wild at Heart and Bad Lieutenant sprinkled among them. Yet what has been consistent is that Cage himself has been seen as one of Hollywood last eccentrics. And yet in person he comes across as surprisingly uneccentric. In fact he seems – “Boring, right?” No! “No, I really am,” he says, and he looks so anxious again that I want to hug him. Our time is almost up and as we prepare to leave, I hear myself saying: “I used to perform one of your soliloquies from Moonstruck when I was a kid.” “Well, I would like to see that!” he says, suddenly smiling again, leaning back in his chair. What, now? “Yes!” Two waiters are hovering. So is the movie PR. People from the tables next to us are starting to stare. “Go on,” he says, waving my self-consciousness away like it was a mere fruitfly. And so, gathering together all the lessons I’ve learned from Cage over the years, I do it. “I ain’t no freaking monument to justice!” I shout in the middle of the Savoy hotel, and I go on to perform the whole damn speech. Halfway through, he joins in with me. “You brought it BACK to me! That was FANTASTIC!” he says, applauding when we finally finish. I stammer apologies for my terrible acting, but he shakes his head. “No, that was GREAT. You really COMMITTED. Yes!” Mandy is released on October This article was corrected on October Kal-El is the name Superman was given as a baby, not the planet where he was born, as originally stated.",2726,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/01/nicolas-cage-if-i-dont-have-a-job-to-do-it-can-be-very-self-destructive
12,"here something a little different about the new Transformers movie, Bumblebee, judging by the debut trailer that hit the web earlier this week . Is it that the sci-fi saga has restored the classic forms some of us just about remember from the television show? Bumblebee is directed by Kubo and the Two Strings director Travis Knight, rather than Michael Bay, who directed the previous five Transformers films, and the title character is once again based on a friendly-looking Volkswagen Beetle, rather than Bay macho Chevy Camaro, while Optimus Prime has the blocky, retro look of the original toy. Or is it that the new film is a prequel set in the While these are important developments, which will hopefully allow Knight to carve out a new direction for the series following Bay shift to a producer role, the most noticeable aspect of the new trailer is the way the new female lead Hailee Steinfeld is presented, in comparison to some of her unluckier female forebears. Steinfeld is the same age Megan Fox was when she appeared as Mikaela Banes in Bay first Transformers movie in Both actors play characters in their late teens, but while Fox spent most of her movie being gleefully leered at by Bay cameras – and her replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley got it even worse in Transformers: Dark of the Moon – Steinfeld has apparently escaped such horrors. Instead of being an object of desire for the saga presumably mostly male and teenage audience, the tomboyish Charlie Watson is presented through a filter borrowed from teen movies such as Karate Kid, Risky Business and Ferris Bueller Day Off, each of which also treated cars as an essential part of the coming-of-age process. We can only hope that studio Paramount won’t now be subjected to the kind of backlash suffered by Lucasfilm over its decision to shift the gender balance among Star Wars characters over the past few episodes. Certainly, fans of Bay films may be in for a shock when they turn up to the multiplex to find this is a movie about a girl and her robot, rather than a feature-length throwback to the Loaded magazine era. Some people may wonder if Knight vision for the future of the franchise owes something to the change in attitudes since Transformers first hit cinemas. Surely there would be a few eyebrows raised in were Bay to ask his lead actor to wash his Ferrari by way of a screen test, which is what Fox was reportedly subjected to prior to signing up to Transformers, or demand an actor perform a “runway stomp” for the film-maker and his crew in the middle of the desert while wearing only “a bra and underwear and a big, billowing, black, floor-length cape and high heels”, as happened to Huntington-Whitely ? The truth is that Transformers never really needed sex in the first place – certainly not the leering, lascivious kind served up in the early movies. Bay is the kind of film-maker who could shoehorn boob and bum shots into a big-screen adaptation of The Care Bears. But Transformers, as Bumblebee seems set to prove, looks a lot more comfortable as a PG offering. Transformers’ core audience does not necessarily need to be horny male teenagers. The toys are not usually found in the adult section of Smyths, and Optimus Prime doesn’t transform into a Rampant Rabbit when you press his helmet. Bay and his ilk may not like it, but it turns out there are times when cinematic infantilisation can be a positive step forward. Especially for a property that was always supposed to be for children in the first place. This is where Transformers always belonged, sat next to warm-hearted kid-and-their-robot movies such as The Iron Giant and Big Hero Six, not jostling for space in the DVD bargain bin with old copies of Barb Wire and Hardbodies . The only question is why Paramount and Bay took so long to work it out.",665,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/28/bumblebee-hailee-steinfeld-transformers-is-for-kids
13,"aving something to say is one thing; having a way to make people listen is a whole other bag.” This is what an awestruck Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) tells fledgling singer-songwriter Ally, played by Lady Gaga, in the newest and shiniest remake of A Star Is Born . Premiering last month at Venice film festival to rave reviews – and early Oscars buzz for both Cooper and Gaga – it is, as Variety Owen Gleiberman put it, “a transcendent Hollywood movie”. As far as pop music is concerned, the messenger matters. Like the traditional Hollywood musical, pop star movies follow the familiar arc of an artist finding their voice – and, best of all, feature real pop stars. As a pop music superfan who struggles with musicals and the tiresome way they crowbar narrative into song and dance numbers, I’m obsessed with this movie subgenre. They’re fascinating as vehicles for stardom – and revealing about the kind of icons the pop stars turned actors want to be associated with, as well as the legacies they wish to leave themselves (consider Diana Ross as Billie Holiday in Lady Sings the Blues , and Beyoncé as a version of Diana Ross in Dreamgirls ). In an age of hyperdocumentation, pop stars are more precious than ever about how their star personas are perceived. Yet in the reflection of another star image, we can often see them more clearly. They can be based on real people, like Gregory Nava under-appreciated Selena which featured Jennifer Lopez – now a successful actor in her own right – as the late Tejano music diva Selena Quintanilla, or imagined ones, like Whitney Houston Rachel Marron in The Bodyguard (Mick Jackson, possibly the greatest pop star movie of all time. That film starred Houston at the apex of her fame, making for a metatextual masterpiece that captured her luminosity at its brightest, before it flickered as she declined into drugs. They can be Oscar success stories, like Motown musical Dreamgirls , for which American Idol finalist Jennifer Hudson won the award for best supporting actress (her fizzing performance makes co-star Beyoncé look like a half-empty can of flat Coke). They can also be the stuff of Golden Raspberry lore, for example Glitter a tragically bad, box-office flop that features Mariah Carey botched cover of Tom Browne Funkin’ for Jamaica (NY) on the soundtrack. It saw Carey receive a Razzie for worst actress (probably not helped by the film release date, just one week after If you’re lucky, you might get two pop stars in the same movie – Burlesque starred Christina Aguilera as a small-town waitress who moves to Los Angeles and winds up singing in a nightclub run by – wait for it – Cher. Some pop star movies are misunderstood, like the Shonda Rhimes-scripted Crossroads which followed Britney “Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman” Spears as she road-tripped in search of her estranged mother, writing songs with strange boys en route. Others, like Cadillac Records , which tried and failed to channel the world-weary soul singer Etta James via a stiff-backed Beyoncé , are simply miscast. Sometimes pop stars are just silver-screen versions of themselves; either played straight, like Eminem Detroit rapper on the rise, Jimmy “B-Rabbit” Smith, in the autobiographical Mile or as straight parody (the Spice Girls movie, Spice World , an endearingly wacky satire on fame and the free press directly inspired by the Beatles’ A Hard Day Night ). According to Martha Shearer, lecturer in film studies at King College London, pop star films “have been a significant component of Hollywood cinema going back to the coming of sound”, with some of the biggest stars of the studio era, like Bing Crosby and Doris Day, making their name as pop singers first. The key turning point, she says, was in the when films became increasingly driven by the popularity of their soundtracks. Or, more specifically, two years earlier, in with Grease . Based on the stage musical of the same name, it made use of pop stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, both of whom had enjoyed chart hits (Travolta with Let Her In in one year before he starred in John Badham Saturday Night Fever ; Newton-John with the singles If Not For You and Banks of the Ohio in In the US, the soundtracks for both Saturday Night Fever and Grease were the No and No two bestselling albums of the year. It was a watershed moment that signalled an appetite for these kinds of movies and set a precedent for the Grammy-winning soundtrack to The Bodyguard to make history as the first album to sell more than a million copies within a one-week period. It not unfair to expect pop stars to be able to act. “Singers often make fabulous actors… all singing is acting”, writes Stephanie Zacharek in Time review of A Star Is Born . And the writer and founder of music website Popjustice, Peter Robinson, says: “Booking an actual singer for the job does a lot of the heavy lifting for a screenwriter or director. You see Gaga and you think of talent, hard work, and a sense that this person deserves to make it because, well, this face you recognise made it in real life.” The casting of Lady Gaga is pitch perfect – the singer we see on screen is a gooseflesh-inducing volt of electricity Bradley Cooper casting of Lady Gaga as an ingénue on the rise is pitch perfect. Stripped of the bells, whistles and wigs that served as a fundamental part of her real star persona, the singer we see on screen is a gooseflesh-inducing volt of electricity. Cooper fading country-rock star encounters Gaga Ally a drag show in a dive bar – a detail that revels in Gaga real coming of age in drag bars on Manhattan Lower East Side (the same is true of French pop star Héloïse Letissier, who was reborn as Christine and the Queens in London Madame Jojo). Masked by dramatic eyebrows and painted red lips, Ally belts out Edith Piaf La Vie En Rose with the commanding, easy confidence of somebody who has performed to a crowd a thousand times before, even finishing with a Flashdance -style dip. A Carole King poster hangs in Ally bedroom, but before long a star-making viral video of Shallow lands her a major label record deal with Interscope (to whom Gaga is signed), and she swapping her acoustic guitar for hip-hop choreography to match the manufactured R&amp;B pop assigned to her. Her mousy hair is dyed bright red, not unlike Britney in the video for her single Toxic . Seeing this version of Ally on stage at the Grammy awards doesn’t exactly feel like a suspension of disbelief. In A Star Is Born emotional centrepiece, Ally joins Jackson on stage to sing, and the film invites the audience to forget, for a moment, that they are watching a master of her craft who has spent the best part of years selling out arenas. Yet it convincing precisely because Gaga has lived a version of this character. As she said in an interview with Vogue , her “natural state” is “dancing and crying”. Shearer says that while performance scenes like this can help to create authenticity, the presence of a real pop star can also “exacerbate the tension between narrative and the standalone attraction of musical performance where the narrative seems like a flimsy excuse”. Robinson is similarly sceptical about how A Star Is Born might be received. “I think Gaga fanbase will approach that recognition factor quite differently,” he says, explaining that the film might be seen as “a career lifeline for someone whose biggest days as a pop star were the best part of a decade ago”. Yet the film is less a resuscitation of Gaga career than it is a defibrillator to the musical melodrama, a genre that has been sadly dormant since The Bodyguard . Cooper A Star Is Born is the fourth retelling of a classic story whose earlier iterations starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March Judy Garland and James Mason and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson For Robinson, there irony in Gaga – an artist known for writing her own material – “launching her acting career in a film that essentially a cover version of a cover version”. But A Star Is Born cheekily acknowledges its legacy, with Jackson telling Ally that pop music is “the same story told over and over again”. All the artist can offer the world is how they see it, he says. Indeed, in the film closing credits, the woman born Stefani Germanotta is billed as Lady Gaga.

14,"he houseboat seems like an artefact that as British as tea and crumpets – a colourful, quaint behemoth ploughing through the sludgy waters of the country canals and waterways. In a turbulent housing market, more people are now turning to “continuous cruising” as a viable way of living – especially in the capital. According to the Canal &amp; River Trust, there are more than licensed boats in the UK today, with more than a third of owners saying their boat primary purpose was as a full-time residence or second home. British cinema has embraced the houseboat and its symbolic value, in conjunction with its surge in real-world popularity. This year, a handful of movies have used this unconventional way of life as part of a character story – and to make a point about contemporary society. The drama Anchor and Hope , from Spanish director Carlos Marques-Marcet, sees Game of Thrones alumni Natalia Tena and Oona Chaplin as lesbian couple Kat and Eva, grappling with the notion of whether to have a child, while living on a boat that travels along the canals of London. Eva is determined to become a parent, and suggests Kat friend as a potential sperm donor, while Kat sees the prospect of bringing a child into their cramped environment as a “selfish” indulgence. It becomes clear through the course of the narrative that Eva adopted the houseboat way of living as a result of her relationship with Kat – a boat enthusiast who repairs them as a part-time job. For Kat, the boat is a symbol of a freewheeling, shackle-free lifestyle whereas, for Eva, it the titular anchor holding her and their relationship down, preventing any progress from taking place. These characters are in the same boat, as it were, but it means very different things to each of them. The houseboat movie trend continues in November with the release of the intriguing drama Tides , which follows four friends who meet for a reunion on a narrowboat. Written and improvised in a collaborative effort by the cast over the course of a few days, it uses the confined, isolated environment as a crucible to amplify the emotions of the characters. This duality of the houseboat as a symbol also plays into some of its other appearances this year. Comedy Swimming With Men portrays the houseboat occupied by Rupert Graves middle-aged professional as a sad symbol of his isolated, bachelor lifestyle. When he invites Rob Brydon character to stay, he looks mournfully at a photo of his kids and admits that he left their mother for a doomed relationship with a younger woman, suggesting that the boat is a miserable compromise for him as a result of bad life choices. On the opposite – and more pleasant – side of the equation, grey pound romcom Finding Your Feet concludes with a standard last-minute dash, as Imelda Staunton protagonist leaves her life of home counties comfort to live with Timothy Spall on his houseboat. For her, the boat and its untethered existence provide the perfect opportunity for her to escape her love-rat husband and her bland, middle-class life. Escape is also represented by a houseboat in the British romcom Patrick . The course of this particular story sees Beattie Edmondson permanently exhausted protagonist handed the opportunity to ditch her demanding landlord and pokey flat in order to embrace the freedom of life aboard her own houseboat. In a story that delights in piling as much suffering on Edmondson as possible, the prospect of a life on the water offers a rare oasis of escapism for her. It a scenario familiar to many of the new millennial cruisers. The prominence of the houseboat in so many British movies also underlines its changing role in society. Once, it was a symbol of quaint holidaying for the elderly. In a episode of the sitcom Peep Show, a canal boat provided a venue for the squarest stag do in history and proved to be an emblem for the affluent, middle-class lifestyle craved by David Mitchell character. A decade later, however, the narrowboat has become a viable housing choice for cash-strapped millennials spooked by gargantuan house prices. For couples like Kat and Eva in Anchor and Hope, the houseboat might be the only way they can secure a home in the capital, and a symbol of an attractive, bohemian lifestyle. For film-makers, the boat has become a malleable symbol capable of saying all manner of different things about the troubled waters of life.",752,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/27/all-aboard-why-the-houseboat-is-making-waves-on-the-big-screen
15,"hen it comes to Harry Potter , JK Rowling just can’t leave it alone. This is not necessarily a bad thing – fans have got to see Harry and friends all grown-up in the Cursed Child plays – but she also managed to muddy the waters by her constant rejigging of the original narrative furniture. The latest act of retroactive continuity (or “retcon” as it become known) to the source material comes via the final trailer for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald , which confirmed that the mysterious character played by Korean actress Claudia Kim is in fact Nagini, the same Nagini who was Lord Voldemort right-hand-snake in the original books and film series. JK Rowling defends decision to cast South Korean actor as Nagini in Fantastic Beasts The deadly viper was always believed to be just that – or rather, Rowling never provided any further backstory to the snake until now, even though she said on Twitter that she been sitting on this secret for years . Now we’re told that Nagini was originally a woman trapped as a snake because of a blood curse passed down through her maternal family line. There been much discussion on social media over this revelation, accusing the author of racism. Some aren’t happy with the optics of a woman of colour playing a character who ends up being subservient to a villain inspired by Nazism, others are frustrated that Rowling has attributed Nagini name to Indonesian instead of Indian mythology and cast a Korean actress in the role as though eastern ethnic minorities are interchangeable. This latter point seems fairer than the former, as anyone who has read the Harry Potter books or seen the films knows that Voldemort treats everyone, of every creed, like servants, but that Nagini is held in highest regard. Even Dumbledore recognised this in the Half-Blood Prince when, speaking of Voldemort and Nagini relationship, he tells Harry: “I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything.” So the idea that Rowling is a racist for making Nagini a woman of colour seems well off court. If anything, the retcon has a more sizeable effect on Neville Longbottom. His heroic defeat of the snake in The Deathly Hallows , by chopping off her head to destroy the Horcrux inside, is lessened now that we know that Nagini was a human all along. As Nagini was a victim to a curse not of her own making, then her murder, despite her evil wrongdoing, seems less justified. And this is the problem: by constantly meddling with her original source material, mostly to make it seem more diverse, Rowling is setting herself up for criticism. Harry Potter might be one of the most universally beloved book series but in hindsight it hardly the most progressive; Rowling has been trying to score woke points ever since. Her tweet revelations have even earned a running joke on social media about how she comes up with progressive additions to her predominantly cisgender and white characters. Fantastic Beasts why can't they just let Dumbledore be gay? The most famous of these character tweaks came in when she confirmed that Albus Dumbledore was gay. Many in the LGBTQ community felt validated by the confirmation but others were rightly sceptical . If the Hogwarts headteacher was gay why was it never mentioned in any of the seven books or eight films? And what does that say about Dumbledore, that he was himself a progressive individual who believed in equality for all, but his own sexuality was closeted from the people around him? It doesn’t do his character any favours. Rowling has promised that the Fantastic Beasts films will explore Dumbledore homosexuality and the final trailer certainly hints at that. But surely it would make more sense for Rowling to come up with new characters instead of retroactively correcting narrative missteps. That way, the integrity of the Harry Potter books remains intact, Rowling no longer has to claim every narrative decision was anticipated years ago, and fans from all backgrounds can enjoy the new movies while feeling represented.

16,"he surprising presence of two thrillers at the Toronto film festival featuring women in the lead role of detective underlines how rare such films are. Destroyer and Out of Blue represent a pair of refreshing entries to a male-dominated genre. But this shortage isn’t just a symptom of good old-fashioned Hollywood sexism – it also seems to have its roots in a deeper, more complex apprehension. The movie detective is so popular because it a character trope centred on transgressions – try to count them, and you’ll soon note many more bad cops than good ones. It excites us to see a character do things society does not allow; when they can justify this violence with claims of a higher purpose – justice, for instance, or protecting innocent people – it is exhilarating. Films about bad cops often push this logic to its breaking point, forcing us to wonder if the end really justifies the means . Out of Blue review – Carol Morley conjures a cosmically uncanny noir In Dirty Harry, Clint Eastwood Harry Callahan successfully stops some bank robbers from fleeing the scene of the crime, but not without killing two of them in the process. We can judge and reprimand him for those deaths – and for risking the lives of civilians by opening fire in public – but also absolve him because he put his life on the line. At the end of the day, he did his job, and saved innocent lives. The character is so alluring precisely because of this fragile sliver of righteousness. Similarly in Karyn Kusama Destroyer , washed-up detective Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman) does not hesitate to start shooting at bank robbers, endangering everyone in the building. Seeing a woman in the role of the jaded and aggressive cop who refuses to play by the book still feels startling – Sandra Bullock turn in Murder by Numbers as a promiscuous detective with a distaste for authority comes to mind, but that was years ago. And when a badass female detective does appear, she will tend to differ in one key way from her male peers: while the wayward methods of Dirty Harry and the rest are accepted as simple character trait, a female detective rebellious attitude often stems from some past trauma. Elisabeth Moss cop in the TV series Top of the Lake , for example, attacks a man with a glass bottle not out of bloody-minded vigilantism but because he was one of her rapists. In Out of Blue Patricia Clarkson aloof toughness is linked to an ordeal from her childhood. In that regard, Kidman cop in Destroyer represents a leap forward. “Don’t make excuses for what you want. It weak,” she says, and the realisation that she behaved as she did simply because she wanted to is chilling. But she remains an outlier. Why this need to justify female detectives’ violent impulses? Besides the fact that it is another way of stripping female characters of agency – instead of acting on their environment, they are reacting to it – this tendency seems to go hand-in-hand with an anxiety around motherhood. Protection through violence and maternal affection are two concepts at odds with each other, and which Hollywood often puts together for thrilling effect – usually in the story of a mother vendetta. In Kidnap , Halle Berry becomes an action hero in a split second, running after the criminals who have her son. In Peppermint , Jennifer Garner turns into a killing machine after the murders of her husband and daughter. Uma Thurman Bride vows to Kill Bill , the man responsible for the death of her unborn child. The Equalizer: why have Hollywood vigilantes gone soft? In other cases, the maternal instinct kicks in as a plot twist. Taraji P Henson Proud Mary is a hitwoman who isn’t so proud and detached after all, becoming the protector of a young boy after she kills his father. Kathleen Turner tough private investigator VI Warshawski finds herself befriending the daughter of her murdered boyfriend. By contrast, the parental instincts of male detectives tends to be immaterial. When they are fathers, they are usually held to much lower standards of parenthood than their female counterparts. In Heat , Al Pacino Lt Vincent Hanna is too busy chasing after bank robbers to participate much in family life. Yet his shortcomings are forgotten when he dramatically saves the young step-daughter who has attempted suicide. That his emotional neglect may have played a part in the girl desperation and that his absence directly led to her mother spending the evening with another man is conveniently forgotten. Female detectives rarely have it so easy – although Prime Suspect has the merit of standing by Helen Mirren Jane Tennison even once she “fails” as a wife and mother. When her husband leaves her because she is too obsessed with her work, the problem clearly isn’t her dedication but his sexist expectations. In Out of Blue, Patricia Clarkson Mike Hoolihan seems perfectly happy living alone with her cat (even if motherhood is central to her reckoning with the past). Neither need to be redeemed by maternal principles. Destroyer pushes this feminist idea to an almost uncomfortable extreme. Kidman hard-boiled detective isn’t too busy to be a good, nurturing mother. Rather, she simply fails at being one. She loves her daughter and has the skills to protect her, but she cannot take care of her in the day-to-day. It in her character; she is the Destroyer. Feminism isn’t just about letting women be bad – it is also about accepting that they can be bad mothers. Destroyer screens at the London film festival on October and is released in the US on Christmas day.

17,"enry Cavill is Superman no more, and that probably isn’t such a bad thing. The story behind his departure – whether he jumped or whether he was pushed – is bound to come out in good time, but for now please join me in not mourning the end of his mute, grumpy, murderous emo nightclub bouncer tenure. Instead, let look to the future. Superman is bound to be recast, because this is and the notion of dormant intellectual property has long since ceased to exist, so the best we can do is lazily speculate who’ll come next. Fortunately for all of you, I have some suggestions. Ryan Gosling You’d imagine that Ryan Gosling has to be near the top of most Superman wish lists. He tall, he smooth and – as Only God Forgives proved – he can do quite a lot with barely any dialogue if that the route Warner Bros still want. However, two things stand in his way. First, Gosling best performances tend to have a slight ironic remove, which wouldn’t work if he playing a pure-hearted hero. And, second, why the hell would he want to play Superman? Henry Cavill to stop playing Superman, reports suggest Armie Hammer Perhaps instead Warner Bros will revisit the DC logbooks and hire Armie Hammer , the man who was scheduled to play Batman in George Miller aborted Justice League movie. He’d be a terrific Superman, too. In Mirror Mirror , he demonstrated a level of bovine gormlessness that could easily be recalibrated into Superman iron-clad sincerity – except for a couple of things. First, Hammer used Call Me By Your Name to pivot away from dumb blockbusters. And second, why the hell would he want to play Superman? Michael B Jordan Apparently, Jordan has emerged as the frontrunner to take over from Cavill, and for good reason. He probably the most respected actor to have one foot firmly in superhero territory. In Black Panther , he achieved the impossible by helping to create a memorable Marvel villain. In Chronicle he all but played Superman, and acquitted himself brilliantly. Sure, his casting would be booed by all the people who wet their knickers over The Last Jedi , but it would be an inspired choice. There still one issue here, though: why the hell would he want to play Superman? Miles Teller Now, bear with me. Think of Miles Teller and there a good chance that you still think of the Esquire feature that repeatedly and convincingly laid out the argument that he was an unstoppable dick. But what if a healthy dose of dickishness is just what Superman needed? Superman biggest problem is his intense blandness. His powers are unbeatable, his intentions never less than utterly pure. He a drag to play and a drag to watch. But what if he was shot through with some of Teller swaggering, slightly unearned confidence? What if there was a Superman movie about Superman letting his Supermanniness go to his head and acting like a bit of a knob? Wouldn’t Miles Teller be good for that? Nicolas Cage The next Superman movie won't be any good, but Cage desperately needs the money Again, Cage came close to playing Superman before, up to the point of performing a costume test for Tim Burton aborted Superman Lives. But that was old Nicolas Cage . That Nicolas Cage made good creative choices. That Nicolas Cage didn’t need the money. The Nicolas Cage we have now, though, makes terrible choices and desperately needs the money, which makes him a compelling choice for Superman. Because the next Superman movie won’t be any good. We know that and Cage knows that, but he’ll take the job anyway because he blew all his money on castles and dinosaur skulls back in the day. And you’d watch a Nicolas Cage Superman film. Of course you’d watch it. Jared Leto Anyone? Hello? No? Oh fine, suit yourselves. Nobody Here a good idea – let just stop making Superman films. Let just come to the agreement that Christopher Reeve was the best Superman, even though two and a half of his four films stank, and draw a line under the whole sorry thing. Let just agree that, while the character worked in the more innocent days of the century, Superman has no place in an age as cynical as this. Anyone making a Superman film now has two choices: compromise the character by making him darker, or stay true to the character and make an anachronism. That a lose-lose decision. Wouldn’t it be better if they just stopped? Wouldn’t it? Imagine how happy we’d all be if they stopped. But they won’t stop, will they, which is why … A cabbage on a stick There. That who should play Superman next.

18,"t starting to look as if Brie Larson Captain Marvel will be Marvel considered response to all those critics who complained about the lack of a headlining female superhero in the studio first nine years . Disappointed that Black Widow always has to fight lower-level baddies because she lacks real superpowers? According to Larson in the new edition of Total Film, Carol Danvers will be able to move entire planets. Upset that the Avengers seem to be led by bickering superblokes while the ladies take a back seat? There may never have been a superhero so intrinsically linked to the survival of humanity as Captain Marvel, whom the studio has pitched as Earth best hope in the fight against Thanos (a figure even the Hulk found himself cowering before.) She is even played by an Oscar-winner, just to ensure we are absolutely clear that the half-Kree hero arrival in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a very big deal indeed. All this is as it should be. But is Danvers up to the task? We’ll find out when Captain Marvel is released in March. Set in the it will see the superhero battling to stop Earth invasion by the Skrulls. The arrival on the scene of the nefarious, shapeshifting aliens, a staple of the comics, throws up all kinds of intriguing possibilities for the past, present and future of the MCU, with the knowledge that they have been around for at least two decades, meaning we could be in for some uncomfortable revelations regarding the true identities of some of Earth mightiest heroes. In the comic-book storyline Secret Invasion, several superheroes were revealed to be Skrulls in disguise, including the original Ant-Man, Hank Pym. It more likely, in the event that Marvel chooses to riff on Secret Invasion, that key members of the Avengers will turn out to have been temporarily replaced by Skrulls, rather than being Skrulls all along – otherwise Marvel risks destroying the emotional weight of its recent back catalogue. But that still leaves room for some tantalising revelations – what if some of the superheroes who died at the hands of Thanos in Infinity War were Skrull impostors rather than the real thing? This might not be as outlandish as it sounds. According to Mark Ruffalo in recent comments to the Hollywood Reporter , Marvel is filming that movie still untitled sequel on the fly, not so much reshooting scenes to take account of script changes but treating the movie like a “living organism” that has not yet settled into its final form. It seems likely, then, that there is potential for Infinity War storyline to riff on any Skrull-focused revelations in Captain Marvel. Filming without a final script has led to the downfall of directors even better known than Infinity War Russo brothers in the past. Just ask Peter Jackson, who has been candid about the difficulties he faced shooting the Hobbit trilogy without a full plan in place. The difference with Marvel is that this is a well-oiled, producer-led machine that has now released movies and prides itself on utilising film-makers who can think on their feet. Studio head Kevin Feige clearly has the ability to juggle many balls at once – Marvel has had three movies a year in cinemas for the past two years, all with interlinking narratives. It means that the studio is able to take account of fan criticism at the same time by parachuting in Larson to solve its diversity deficit, as if shifting its feet to change direction at full pelt like an elite footballer riding a tackle. Might Captain Marvel setting even have been inspired by the desire to retrofit the MCU with a diversity upgrade? Placing Danvers’ origins story in the past, at least a decade prior to the first wave of Marvel movies, suggests the studio is constantly working to refine its tangled web of superhero intrigue. If you were left confused by the post-credits scene from Infinity War, in which Samuel L Jackson Nick Fury pages Danvers just before he crumbles into dust, the picture becomes more focused in the new movie. Captain Marvel, we learned earlier this year , was the first superpowered being to come on to Fury radar, the inspiration for SHIELD and The Avengers. So not only has the studio fixed its female superhero problem by making Danvers tougher than the Hulk, Thor and Spider-Man put together, it has effectively retooled its entire cinematic universe to place the new arrival on a central plinth in the Marvel pantheon – standing so tall there can be no suggestion she might be just a diversity-fuelled afterthought. That a magic trick Doctor Strange himself would be proud of.",784,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/13/captain-marvel-cinematic-universe-diversity-brie-larson
19,"razy Rich Asians opens with Napoleon Bonaparte and Louis Vuitton. “Let China sleep,” the film quotes the great Frenchman saying, “for when she awakens she will shake the world.” An opulent London hotel refuses to honour Singaporean matriarch Eleanor Young reservation, as her children slump across their LV suitcases, suggesting perhaps she might be happier somewhere in Chinatown. An enraged Young, played by Michelle Yeoh , makes one phone call to her husband, who buys the hotel – an act that has been hailed as Asian empowerment. We never see nor hear from Young husband, whose sole function seems to be the revenge purchasing of hotels, again. But many more vignettes of ostentatious acquisition and wealth follow. Even the pet dogs are called Astor and Rockefeller . In a recent op-ed, Thomas Friedman , the New York Times columnist, noted that he “really enjoyed” Crazy Rich Asians because “it reminded me of an important point: Rich Asia has gotten really rich”. Friedman declared after a trip to India that the world was becoming flat, or in other words, as rich as his own plutocratic circles – which includes Mohamm ed bin Salman , crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who is reported to have recently dropped on a Da Vinci . Perhaps Friedman flat-world delusion helps understand how Crazy Rich Asians can be seen as a film about Asian empowerment. For the film, which has crossed the mark, and has enjoyed the highest opening for a romantic comedy in three years, and is indeed funny and charming in parts, is best described as a celebration of transnational plutocracy. Some Asian Americans, for so long either invisible or caricatured by Hollywood, have welcomed Crazy Rich Asians for its representation of a minority. Though it is the monoculture of capitalism, not Asia, that is on display. In fact, “ Asia ” is used in Crazy Rich Asians in the same manner that many westerners employ “ Africa ”, lumping together countries with distinct cultures, languages, and histories. The film map of the continent names only four countries: Singapore, India, China, and Thailand. As for south Asians , who make up a substantial part of Singapore population, I counted only four: one Sikh man at a hawker centre, the rest employed as guards. Asianness is mere window dressing, satisfied by cliched heaps of familial guilt, food shots, and gossipy society ladies. But the film codes, signs and symbols actually belong to capitalism and its new elite. There are the plummy British boarding school accents, couture gowns, first-class cabins and hot bods. Bollywood , the largest film industry in the world, embraced this nouveau-riche aesthetic a good years ago, replacing the downtrodden hero who grows up sleeping on footpaths with urban banker-dreamboats who drive Ferraris in London and yank off their shirts to reveal glistening six packs. ‘It not a movie, it a movement’: Crazy Rich Asians takes on Hollywood Interestingly, Crazy Rich Asians has no main white speaking parts. The only white characters to be are given dialogue – the hotel staff at the very start of the film – expose themselves as racists. This might appear to give the film a political edge – an interpretation encouraged by the film makers and promoters. “It not a movie, it a movement,” director Jo n M Chu has said. But unbridled wealth can’t be a leader for any worthwhile mass movement. Its excesses, in cinema at least, lend themselves best to the sort of scathing treatment given by The Godfather II, the greatest ever meditation on American capitalism, and American Psycho, by far the sharpest film about the crazy rich. Crazy Rich Asians isn’t the first film of its type to be released by a major Hollywood studio. Remember that Sex and the City in which Carrie and the girls romped through “Abu Dhabi” in designer heels and, inexplicably, turbans, was released in – a mere two years after the financial crash. “How do we tip in Abu Dhabi?” Charlotte asks as they arrive at their palatial hotel. “Have ya got any loose rubies?” Carrie replies. It is clearer today that to be “crazy rich” at a time of catastrophic inequality is not a victimless crime. The world richest have seized twice as much growth as the bottom according to World Inequality Report authored by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and others. Until this year, India had the world largest population of poor people, and of China population survives on just over a day (Crazy Rich Asians isn’t being released in either country even though China is the second-largest box office market in the world). Singapore itself struggles with inequality and political disaffection. What are the crazy rich Asians doing about the downtrodden and left-behind in their midst? Nothing, it would seem. Microfinance receives a cameo mention in Crazy Rich Asians, albeit via a Thai princess who for some unexplained reason is writing papers on the subject; Myanmar is referenced only in relation to its rubies; and Rachel Chu, the non-rich love interest ( played by Constance Wu ), is a professor of economics at NYU, but these are the sole references to the existence of the Free markets were promised as the rising tide that would lift all boats, but revolts against globalisation reveal that only the superyachts of the global rich have been lifted while a vast majority struggles to stay afloat in leaking rafts. Hollywood has played an crucial role in defanging crazy rich westerners: billionaire Bruce Wayne is a civil saviour, Daddy Warbucks saves sad orphans, Christian Grey is an irresistible charmer. Hollywood turned “show me the money” into a feelgood mantra – and how cute were those shopaholics in Clueless ? To be extra safe in its sanitising of the ultra-wealthy, Hollywood now lets members of minorities play them in box-office-busting films. A genuine breakthrough, however, will only come when Hollywood makes the Asian version of that great film on the modern capitalism: Asian Psycho.",994,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/12/crazy-rich-asians-racial-triumph
20,"illy Liar always was a great night out. “A brand new kind of escapist entertainment,” the trailer blared when the film was released in But the escape it most literally concerned – one in which a northern funeral clerk might jump on a train and make it as a London scriptwriter – wasn’t then so far fetched. Adapted from his own novel by Keith Waterhouse, it arrived in a Britain giddy on the Beatles and grammar school upstarts like Billy. Social mobility brought the film to life. While director John Schlesinger was solidly Hampstead, Waterhouse was a dropout from Osmondthorpe Council School, Leeds, and star Tom Courtenay the son of a Hull dockworker. As the box office boomed, a daydreamer might have conjured up a British film industry filled with working-class actors and writers, maybe even directors and producers, too. Of course – spoiler warning – Billy never caught the train. The apparent golden age of social mobility would quickly sputter out. And the idea of this class calling the shots in British cinema? Rarely more than fantasy. Now, the mood is darker. In it can be hard finding working-class talent exerting any influence in the creative space of British film. Even the actors are vanishing. “We have got a big problem,” Equity president Maureen Beattie said recently of the lack of opportunities for working-class performers. Actors including Maxine Peake and Lesley Manville appeared at the BFI this spring to publicly highlight the crisis. Drama has been cut from the classroom, young actors priced out of training, a glum contest among those who remain for dwindling roles as gang members and sex workers. But actors are just part of an ecosystem. They can only play roles created by writers for films made by directors. And the story of working- class screenwriters is another with a glorious future behind it – the postwar era that produced Waterhouse also witnessed the black precision of Harold Pinter and the singular vision of Shelagh Delaney , writer of A Taste of Honey , finder of wonder in back streets and bedsits. It worth pausing just to consider how unlikely it would now be for a major British film to be written by a young woman from Salford with no university education. Class in is hard to define but harder to address. Even discussing the most straightforward socioeconomic measure – how closely an industry reflects the national baseline of of the population attending private school – causes fluttering unease. Still, the scale of the problem can be glimpsed in the origins of five current directors who have scaled British cinema to win regular big-budget studio projects: Matthew Vaughn, Guy Ritchie, Tom Hooper, Sam Mendes and Christopher Nolan . All were privately educated. Parity in terms of class – let alone representation of women and people of colour – would require there were other directors of a similar standing who went to state schools. Feel free to start counting. Of course, British directors from working-class backgrounds make high‑profile films. Just not many – and these success stories tend to come with caveats. Danny Boyle made his first feature, Shallow Grave , nearly years ago. Steve McQueen will open the London film festival in October with his much-anticipated thriller Widows , but his route from the London suburb of Hanwell to the red carpet came via the art world, which, like theatre, is more meritocratic than British film. And then there is Lynne Ramsay . For a director in a landscape of limited chances, the reward can be whispering campaigns. Ramsay, whose mother was a cleaner in Glasgow, acquired a reputation as difficult and volatile and all the other codewords used for working-class women who have an opinion. Her last film, the astonishing crime drama You Were Never Really Here , was wildly praised. It was also only her fourth feature film in nearly two decades. Move through the ranks of the business – past the actors, writers and directors – and eventually you reach the producers, development executives, the heads of production companies and funding bodies. Here at last are the decision-makers who shape everything British you see on a cinema screen. Socio-economically, it is a group drawn from the same pool as so many of our MPs, lawyers and journalists. It was ever thus and the didn’t change it. Legally, class is not a “protected characteristic” in the labour market – but then film is mostly lawless anyway, filled with opaque hiring practices and internships for those whose bills are paid by other means. From script readers up, the result has been a highly specialised gatekeeper class taking charge of endless safety-first development streams. Presented with working-class experiences, its members might just as well be listening to Finnish. The issue is not only people having a fair shot at the top jobs in British film; also at stake are the films that never get made. A defining feature of the working-class moment was youth – Delaney co-wrote the screenplay for A Taste of Honey at The tradition endured: Ramsay was when she made her first feature Ratcatcher , Shane Meadows at the time of his, Small Time . Now, the industry risk aversion would slow any young film-maker – but the particular discomfort with these kinds of voices means an extra long spell in limbo. Director Deborah Haywood was before she made her debut feature, this summer brilliantly off-kilter portrait of smalltown England, Pin Cushion . Colin O’Toole, winner of the Bafta for best British short with the tightly wound Cowboy Dave , is already with a string of other shorts behind him. Meadows, by the way, effectively left British film in favour of TV years ago. Ramsay acquired a reputation as volatile, and all the other code words for working-class women with an opinion While it felt reasonable to hope that iPhones and YouTube – or at least cheap cameras and Vimeo – would provide cinema with a new generation of ordinary hotshots, the reality has been patchy. Gifted young directors have appeared online, many either working class or dealing with working-class life – Cecile Emeke, Aaron Dunleavy, Kibwe Tavares, Emma Gilbertson. But a well‑signposted bridge has yet to open between online creativity (nimble, democratic) and British cinema (nervous, arthritic). In class definitions are works in progress, old touchstones such as university degrees less meaningful, race and gender recognised as central. But to get lower-class characters on to a big screen, the safest bet remains being Ken Loach. Thank God for him – few directors have his heft, or could have made a film as vital as I, Daniel Blake . Things only get tricky when the industry sees Loach as a ticked box, apparently believing working-class people exist in a state of gritty social realism the way children think Victorians lived in black and white. Loach has always been more subtle than that. But what are missing are emotionally complex films about people who just happen to work in call centres – one exception that proves the rule is Debbie Tucker Green Second Coming , about a working-class black family touched by metaphysics. Most working-class people are neither thugs nor saints but as mixed-up as the average executive – and the best films hold two thoughts at once. Billy Liar was an absurdist frolic with a brutal punchline; Ramsay eponymous Morvern Callar a blank young raver from a Scottish supermarket who became the heart of a shimmering Spanish road movie. But it is hard to contain multitudes when working-class lives are treated as a niche. It also defies demographics. With class, the situation has never been one in which a small group of people have been shut out of British film; rather, a small group of people have shut themselves inside it. The consequences ripple through everything from the sniggery classism of Matthew Vaughn Kingsman movies to the British Board of Film Classification awarding a certificate to the recent documentary A Northern Soul (too many “fucks” in the wrong accent) to the very cinemas in which prestige British films typically play, the expanding boutique chains Everyman, Picturehouse and Curzon. Economically, short-term salvation lies in the middle-class pound that extends to wine and gourmet popcorn. But the exclusion of the young, skint and state educated from a mass market art form is a shame – and flatly suicidal in the age of Netflix. If the problem is vast, a mirror of the whole British class system, it is also deceptively simple. People like to see people like themselves on screen and be able to afford a ticket.

21,"dewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje wrote what became his first film script in the hope it might help him to get a good night sleep. The actor, best known for roles in Lost, Game of Thrones and Suicide Squad , wanted a way to process his painful childhood. Farming – the film, not the occupation – became his therapy. “I think I’d attained a certain amount of success in my career and life, but was plagued by some feelings that I’d not really resolved,” he says. “I used to write at night just to get to sleep, just to let it out of me. By the end of two weeks, I had a manuscript.” Eighteen years later, a film evolved from these reams of writing and premiered to considerable acclaim at the Toronto film festival. It focuses on his life as a boy whose Nigerian parents “farmed” him out to a white, working-class family in Tilbury, Essex, in the hope of giving him a better future. For a while, this “better future” looked less than certain: the area was strikingly white and his new mother was often cruel and unloving. Plagued by self-loathing, Akinnuoye-Agbaje took an unusual route out of isolation: he joined a local gang of racist skinheads. This plot is not the only surprise about Farming. Another is its casting. As the illiterate, emotionally abusive, racially insensitive Essex foster mother of nine, we have … Kate Beckinsale , best known for toned action heroines and withering upper-class comedies. “I still don’t know why Ade cast me,” she says. “It was such an odd move.” “I remember driving to the read-through and thinking: ‘I’m so glad I’m old, because at the beginning of my career I’d be being sick out of the window,’ because everyone else in the film was proper except me. I was the posh girl from Chiswick coming in.” What could have been a gruelling shoot was, says Beckinsale, anything but. “Very low budget, very short amount of time, incredibly ambitious film, fucking tons of kids, could have been a nightmare. I went into it eating lots of chips [she put on weight for the role] and worrying: ‘Oh my God, there going to be nine children in this tiny living room.’ You didn’t know if they were ever going to say their lines, or if they were going to punch you in the face. And they were angels . Unbelievable.” The tiny living room was one of many spaces painstakingly recreated from Akinnuoye-Agbaje childhood home. Such intimacy, says Beckinsale, made both the shoot and the finished product feel unusual. “It was very different from anything else I’ve ever done because you were always aware that this was Ade story and some of it was incredibly upsetting. You felt very privileged to be in this incredibly vulnerable space.” Damson Idris (star of John Singleton TV series Snowfall), who played Akinnuoye-Agbaje teenage self, was shipped off to Tilbury for full immersion. Idris would encourage the actors playing skinheads to hurl abuse at him, fasted on three apples a day to remain lean and called himself racist terms three times in the mirror before each scene. “I tormented myself throughout this movie,” he says. For Akinnuoye-Agbaje, too, the shoot could have been emotionally tough, but budgetary constraints meant there was little time to grieve about the past. And, watching the results, he says was – happily – “surreal but also cathartic”. He and Beckinsale concur that, at its heart, the film is, in her words, “an incredibly fractured love story between mother and adopted son”. “You did get the urge to say this was a villain, given some of the stuff she would say and the way she spoke to the kids,” says Beckinsale. “But if the parent is evil, it almost less damaging because it the ambivalence that so jarring and difficult and really messes up children.” Realising how much of Ingrid behaviour came from ignorance – and the context of the time and place – was key. “She couldn’t read or write, she had no real self-awareness about why she wanted to adopt seven, eight or nine kids. It such an extreme thing to do without self-analysis. She just was going with her instinct,” says Beckinsale. Akinnuoye-Agbaje says he was drawn to Beckinsale for the role, in part because he wanted someone with charisma, a star who could be “a relatable, lovable rogue”. “I wanted to create this fractured, lovable Fagin-esque type of woman because my mother was a product of her time,” he says. “Her ignorance had a real searing impact on me as a child, but I had to address what had created her.” Yes, he says, the film contains a lot of racist abuse – but these were terms normalised by primetime sitcoms of the day. And, yes, Ingrid and women like her were admirable in taking in children from completely different cultures. But: “They didn’t know they had to grease a black child skin because of their ‘ash’ or put oil in their hair. They didn’t know so many things.” As well as mainlining chips, Beckinsale – who specialised in linguistics at university – sought to perfect an authentic Tilbury dialect. She sent Akinnuoye-Agbaje sample clips of accents she had unearthed – none of which he felt were quite right. The accent that finally got the thumbs-up, in fact, was one Beckinsale says she based on “lairy mates”. “Chiswick is very different from Tilbury. But I have been exposed to other types of people,” she explains, grinning. One aspect of Ingrid character she certainly shares is a striking honesty, which she admits hasn’t always served her well, calling it her “least helpful quality”. “I didn’t realise until I got to Hollywood that there was even a possibility that my opinion might be slightly less counted because of being female or being young. And that was really odd. I’ve never gone in anywhere and forced my opinion – but it literally the having of one at all that can be difficult in certain situations.” She refers to the “old misogyny” that she feels continues to pervade the industry. Last year, she shared her story of being greeted by Harvey Weinstein in a bathrobe when she was and the many expletives he fired at her when she turned down future collaborations. “You hear all these things about actresses being ‘difficult’,” she says. “Well, to me, ‘difficult’ is someone who won’t come out of their trailer or who is late or uncooperative or doesn’t know their lines or treats people rudely. Having an opinion and saying, ‘I do think there a problem here’ isn’t difficult. “I’ve worked with quite a few women about whom people have said, ‘Oh, she difficult’ and then I’ve found them actually rather rigorously professional and totally on time and on top of it. So, just as I’d like to get rid of ‘bossy’ for little girls, I’d quite like to get rid of ‘difficult’ for actresses.” Akinnuoye-Agbaje background as an actor helped with on-set shorthand and sympathy. For him, the motivation behind the film wasn’t just personal catharsis – it was also professional opportunity. “There was the creative frustration of not actually getting roles that really explored the layers of who I was as a human being. They were limited to me – as a colour or a size – and I did what I could with those, and injected what humanity I could. But I wasn’t prepared to wait around for the role to come down the pipeline or place my destiny in the hands of an external factor.” His decision to break out on his own seems to have paid off. Soon after the premiere, Farming was picked up by Lionsgate. The early reactions to this intricately personal and specific story have already had a big impact on Akinnuoye-Agbaje. “What [the response] says to me is that we’re all human and the things that our protagonist goes through are just human trials that everyone faces in their own life,” he says. “OK, in the movie, they’re extreme, but it is about triumph over adversity, challenges and obstacles, finding a sense of belonging, finding self-worth, learning how to love one self and these are things that everyone can relate to.”",1378,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/28/kate-beckinsale-on-her-role-in-farming-if-the-parent-is-100-evil-its-almost-less-damaging
22,"o one needs to teach Will Poulter anything about checking his privilege. The career choices of this show an actor drawn to films with a social conscience. In scarcely more than a decade, he has left behind CGI blockbusters ( one Narnia and two Maze Runners ) and broad comedy ( We’re the Millers , in which he snogged Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts, and briefly sported a swollen prosthetic testicle). Instead, he has moved on to more serious, searching projects: the below-the-breadline chamber-piece Glassland , Kathryn Bigelow race riots drama Detroit and now The Little Stranger , a ghost story that twitches with class tension. The Little Stranger review –&nbsp;Ruth Wilson shines in mournful ghost story In person, too, Poulter is constantly checking, unpicking, interrogating and rechecking himself. Five times during the course of our two conversations – first in a Dublin hotel bar a few hours before the premiere of The Little Stranger , then the following day on the phone – he describes himself with an air of contrition as a “white, straight, middle-class male”, careful to the point of fastidiousness that nothing should be omitted or misunderstood. So cards on the table: he was a pupil at the Harrodian School in west London (current fees: upwards of per term), whose alumni also include Robert Pattinson, Jack Whitehall, Tom Sturridge and George Mackay. “What my privilege has meant is that I haven’t experienced the same levels of exclusion and inaccessibility that might come with being working class,” says Poulter, who is tall and trim, with a serious expression, narrowed eyes and a courteous, meet-the-parents air. “I’ve certainly felt guilty about that. But guilt for those less privileged and those who experience the prejudice from which I’m protected isn’t enough. Acknowledgement is the first step in hopefully using your privilege to realise a more equitable society. I’m trying to find ways to deconstruct that hierarchy as opposed to just enjoying the privilege and acknowledging the guilt.” Such as? “I’m keen to develop as an activist and involve myself in charities and organisations. And with my acting, it important that the projects I do have a sociopolitical impact. I try to be conscious about the message. As a white, straight, middle-class male, I’m aware of things I take for granted.” I wonder how it felt to hear Daniel Mays observe, in that the industry was “awash” with privately educated actors , or to read the Sutton report findings that the same group takes a disproportionately high share of awards of British Bafta winners and of British Oscar winners). Is it like being under attack? “No, no. Not at all. I’ve undoubtedly benefited from my middle-class environment. I hold my hands up to that. And I know that unless we try to make pathways into the industry more open and accessible, then we can’t expect it to reflect society.” This is all pertinent to The Little Stranger, in which a doctor (played by Domhnall Gleeson) in Warwickshire is summoned to the country pile he has coveted since childhood. There he finds Roderick, played by Poulter, who suffered severe burns to his face and leg during the war and has grown old prematurely. “He this boy whose youth has been cut short by his injuries so that he almost jumped forward in time to become an old man. He confined to the house, he hitting the bottle, living with all these regrets. There this emotional decay, which is a strange reflection of what happening to the house. He feels intrinsically tied to the state of the home and he is trying, like a lot of the landed gentry, to take pride in its status, just as he does in his own. But there are these parallels of degradation.” His performance in Detroit was in the tradition of great baby-faced monsters: Attenborough in Brighton Rock, David Bennent in The Tin Drum, Cagney in everything Poulter distinctive facial features serve the part well. Though he is clearly young, there an agelessness to him, an ability to seem both juvenile and jaded. Partly it those windscreen-wiper eyebrows, which sit at a permanent angle and are capable of lending devious or calculating inflections to his soft face. In Detroit, where he played the ringleader of a group of racist cops torturing and murdering African Americans with impunity, it was disturbing to see so much savagery emanating from someone barely out of the playpen. His was a performance in the tradition of cinema great baby-faced monsters: Richard Attenborough in Brighton Rock, David Bennent in The Tin Drum, Cagney in everything. Small wonder he was first choice to play Pennywise the Clown in It before that project lost its original director, Cary Fukunaga. Or that in his mid-teens, he was the standout star of the Edinburgh fringe hit School of Comedy , later adapted into an series, in which child performers delivered blatantly adult material dressed as grownups. It was a kind of Bugsy Malone of sketch shows. Poulter most memorable character was a cocky white van man hollering incomprehensible remarks at passing women. By that point he had already made his film debut at the age of – as a soft-centred hard-nut in Son of Rambow , the coming-of-age comedy about a pair of schoolboys who make their own camcorder version of First Blood. “That was mad, man,” he says. “I don’t know if I would be so in love with what I do if I hadn’t had such an amazing first experience.” He was already passionate about acting, which provided an alternative to the sort of academic demands made difficult by his dyslexia and dyspraxia, as well as a reprieve from some unkindness among his peers. “I had experiences of bullying. I used drama as an antidote to some of the less enjoyable aspects of social life at school.” Garth Jennings, the writer and director of Son of Rambow, remembers Poulter as a precocious talent. “I never did more than a couple of takes for anything,” he says. “It wasn’t just that Will got it – he also understood what the rhythm of the line was, and that it would be funnier if you paused first. His instincts were ridiculously good. I spent most of my days shaking my head in disbelief, just going, ‘Yep. That was it, sunshine. That was it.’” Poulter career since then has not been without its taxing moments. Was it true, as rumour has it, that eight months playing a trapper on The Revenant nearly broke him? He gives a rueful laugh. “Um. I’m always hesitant to complain too much as an actor, but I’ll say it was physically and emotionally probably the hardest thing I’ll ever do. I just can’t imagine a tougher shoot. The conditions were so inhospitable. We were up the side of a mountain in temperatures I didn’t know existed. I find acting enough of a challenge at room temperature.” Jennings met up with Poulter when the actor was on a break from that movie. “Will was staying in the accent so he didn’t lose it when he went back. He was really locked in. Watching him in the film, you think, ‘Oh yeah, there you go – DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Will.’ He just fits right in.” Lenny Abrahamson, the director of The Little Stranger, thinks Poulter has even bigger things ahead. “He viewed in the industry as this incredibly exciting talent,” he says. “You look at him and think, ‘Is there a Bond in Will at some point? Maybe in years?’ I could see that. I could imagine him being a very dark Bond indeed.” The Little Stranger is out now.",1276,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/25/will-poulter-the-little-stranger-white-straight-middle-class-male

Buena Vista Social Club Wim Wenders has always been drawn to misfits, from Patricia Highsmith Ripley in The American Friend to Harry Dean Stanton as the eternal wanderer in Paris, Texas . He brought his taste for the outsider experience to this film about the Cuban ensemble making its first trip to America. I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco Turmoil is a gift to the music documentary. Wilco were up to their eyes in it soon after the photographer Sam Jones started filming them: they shed two of their members and got dropped by their label.

He sings! He preaches! He attacks his manager with a lead pipe! Through it all, the director Jeff Feuerzeig maintains a sympathetic eye. Rude Boy Part-documentary, part-staged reality (a technique that the film co-director, Jack Hazan, had pioneered in his David Hockney doc A Bigger Splash ), this inserts a fictional roadie into the real world of The Clash on tour. A scorching and often ugly portrait of a band at a full pelt and a country in decline. Gimme Shelter There is no shortage of Rolling Stones documentaries, from Godard One Plus One aka Sympathy For the Devil and Robert Frank little-seen Cocksucker Blues to Martin Scorsese more recent Shine a Light . But the cream of the crop, the absolute Exile on Main Street of the bunch, is the Maysles brothers’ account of the band before, during and after the horror of Altamont.

Explaining his resilience, he says: “No one else has got this far, and failed.” Anvil! The Story of Anvil Alongside Some Kind of Monster and DiG!, this is another slice of cringingly frank mid-noughties verité, the key difference being that the group in question, a Canadian metal outfit, came within sniffing distance of fame without ever quite making it big. A reunion tour provides a near-as-dammit real-life equivalent to Spinal Tap . The Decline of Western Civili z ation Part I Penelope Spheeris directed the first film about the American response to punk, with interviews and performances from Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag and Germs, the menace of the latter tempered by dumpy frontman Darby Crash, known to cover himself with peanut butter and dive through broken glass to disguise the fact that his band couldn’t play. Quality control stayed high for Spheeris follow-ups, Parts II (about metal) and III (homeless punks). DOA: A Rite of Passage This film diary of the Sex Pistols’ fateful US tour zig-zags between the Stateside vaudeville and interviews from back home with establishment figures closing their ears to the yelps of punk (“I’m not going to listen to what they say until they learn to enunciate clearly and speak properly in the Queen English”). A grimly compelling highlight is the footage of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen lolling in bed like the anti-John-and-Yoko. DiG! Two bands for the price of one: The Dandy Warhols take the fast train to fame and adulation while their brothers-in-psychedelia, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, languish in semi-obscurity, their integrity intact, their sanity perhaps less so. Ondi Timoner boiled down a staggering hours of footage to create this study of luck and self-sabotage in rock’n’roll. Metallica: Some Kind of Monster Metal behemoths Metallica quietly fall apart in this long but spellbinding documentary which finds them plagued by indecision and uncertainty as they grapple with their incomparable success. With one band member gone and another entering rehab, the band members submit to a “performance enhancement coach” who insinuates himself creepily into the creative process. Bob Dylan: Don’t Look Back DA Pennebaker fingerprints are all over music cinema ( Monterey Pop , Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars ). But his masterpiece follows a restless, searching Bob Dylan as he tours Britain in confronting journalists, holding court among some peers (Joan Baez, Alan Price), sneering at others (sorry, Donovan) and, with the Subterranean Homesick Blues cue-cards sequence, helping to invent the pop promo. In Bed with Madonna (aka Madonna: Truth or Dare) Part of the alchemy of a great music documentary is catching the subject at exactly the right moment, and Alek Keshishian couldn’t have trained his cameras on Madonna at a better time. In the midst of the inventive and influential Blonde Ambition tour, he finds a self-possessed genius who is a magnet for controversy, as well as for other stars: Warren Beatty announces that Madonna “doesn’t want to live off-camera”, Antonio Banderas resists her advances, Kevin Costner gets roundly insulted. But this thrilling film, split between black-and-white for off-stage and colour for on, gives the lion share of screen time to the squabbling, excitable dancers who comprise the singer extended family.

24,"The Ladykillers What on earth was this about? A remake of the Ealing crime-caper classic (with Tom Hanks in Alec Guinness crackpot mastermind role) at least proves, if proof were needed, that the Coens have excellent cinephile taste. But this was pointless and baffling. A case of No Coen Do. Burn After Reading What a dog brunch of a film: a strained and unfunny black comic gang-show of big names, with one or two good gags and an admittedly intriguing turn from Brad Pitt as a dopey fitness freak. The Hudsucker Proxy This period Capraesque comedy about an ordinary guy – a rather uncharismatic Tim Robbins – who is elevated to corporate greatness as part of a share-price scam is an example of how the Coens’ comedy can sometimes lack focus: too quirky and spongy. O Brother, Where Art Thou? The Coens’ love of Preston Sturges resurfaced in this film that whimsically takes upon itself the title of the desperately serious social-realist movie being planned in Sturges’ Sullivan Travels. It is an appealing, likable film about three runaway chaingang convicts in depression America who pass themselves off as a bluegrass trio, their record somehow becoming a hit. Silly, amiable stuff that has faded with time. Hail, Caesar! More golden age Hollywood nostalgia with this cantering comedy about tinseltown: the boozers, the fixers, the divas, the hoofers, the scribblers. It features George Clooney as a none-too-bright ageing star in a cheesy toga-wearing Roman epic. The movie reminded the world what a great dancer Channing Tatum is. True Grit Unprecedented commercial success was what the Coens found with this handsome remake of the John Wayne classic; or rather a new adaptation of the original novel by Charles Portis. Jeff Bridges was probably the only possible casting as the no-account “Rooster” Cogburn, with Hailee Steinfeld as his employer, the Mattie Ross. It is a good-natured, well-made movie, but perhaps without the strong taste of the original, or the Coens’ other films. Intolerable Cruelty Here is the biggest “underrating” issue in contemporary Coenological studies. On release, most critics seemed to decide that this screwball divorce comedy with Catherine Zeta-Jones and George Clooney was no good. I disagree. The smoothie lawyer Miles Massey was a part Clooney was born to play, and Zeta-Jones cat-that-has-every-intention-of-getting-the-cream predator is tremendous. Raising Arizona Some Coenoisseurs regard this early comedy as one of the top three; maybe even the gold medal. For me, it doesn’t stand up that well, but it is an utterly distinctive film with twang and snap, a realist-fantasy action comedy drama with weird subplots and extraneous minor characters. Holly Hunter is the cop who falls in love with Nicolas Cage criminal; on discovering they can’t have kids, they get involved in the most wackily innocent child abduction imaginable. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs The Coens have created a gem with their latest film, a western portmanteau of tales from a comically picturesque old west, conceived with humour, warmth and visual flair. Some stories are better than others, but the best are superb, and Tim Blake Nelson has what must be the greatest role of his career as Buster Scruggs, the singin’, gunslingin’ cowpoke. Barton Fink This was the award-winning movie that turned the Coens into hall-of-famers, a fantasy satire of golden-age Hollywood about a lonely screenwriter called Fink (John Turturro) mixed up in a horrible mystery. There is a fair bit of style-over-substance, and the film was denounced by no less a figure than Arthur Miller as “meaningless”, but stylish is undoubtedly what it is. Inside Llewyn Davis The complacent world of early pre-Dylan folk is the location for this touching and often hilarious drama about a failing Greenwich Village folk singer: the prickly Llewyn Davis (that Welsh-sounding first name does not in fact exist outside this film), played by Oscar Isaac. It is a poignant look at the awful midlife decisions that artists have to make when it becomes clear that their careers are not working out. A Serious Man The big debate about how funny the Coens ever fully intend to be is maybe crystallised by the adjective in the title here: an entirely engrossing and personal film, set in the mid-west of their childhood. It is wonderfully acted by Michael Stuhlbarg (an all too rare lead role for him), who plays the academic plunged into despair when his wife declares that their marriage is over. Miller Crossing An inspired prohibition mob thriller that has been alchemised into a Coen film with an elegant and eccentric comic perspective. There is a great performance from a young Gabriel Byrne as that gangster-staple: the ambitious young guy in the organisation, a little out of his depth. And there is a glorious shootout soundtracked by Danny Boy. Fargo One of the Coen movies to be garlanded at Cannes, this comically inflected noir is now enjoying an afterlife as a TV spinoff. Frances McDormand gives what may be her greatest Coen performance as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant Minnesota cop investigating a crooked scheme by William H Macy car-dealer to kidnap his own wife. The Man Who Wasn’t There Discussions of the Coen oeuvre always centre on what over- and underrated, and there is plenty of room in the closely grouped mid-table for this kind of argument, but for me The Man Who Wasn’t There is one of their very best films: an eerily beautiful and slow-moving black-and-white LA noir in the style of James M Cain or Robert Aldrich, with Billy Bob Thornton as a barber whose wife (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her boss (James Gandolfini). Gripping. Blood Simple The Coens’ devastatingly good low-budget debut from an inspired noir thriller, quite without the comic quirkiness of their later works. It still looks and feels entirely original, despite its obvious generic inspirations. Frances McDormand is a young woman, cheating on her abusive husband (a superb Dan Hedaya), who then hires a creepy gumshoe to follow her,with a showstoppingly evil performance from M Emmet Walsh. The Big Lebowski For many, this will always be the greatest Coen film, and it is certainly beguilingly funny, baggy, freewheeling and strange, with a great performance from Jeff Bridges as the Dude, bringing a weird gravitas to a role that might have seemed merely spacey or wacky with a lesser performer. No Country For Old Men This sensational and apocalyptic drama, based on the western thriller by Cormac McCarthy, is still the Coens’ masterpiece: a noirish nightmare that takes place under a vast Texan sky, leavened with brilliant wisecracks. Javier Bardem Anton Chigurgh is a horribly bizarre villain, and Tommy Lee Jones sheriff is a voice of sanity and humour in a world of evil.",1114,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/07/the-coen-brothers-film-ranked

Moretz plays Cameron Post, a teenaged orphan in small-town America who is caught kissing the prom queen.

An awful warning about the elusive nature of truth? Bart Layton new film is based on the true story of a bunch of students who, in got it into their heads to steal rare books from a university library in Kentucky. The participants are played by actors but the real people themselves are interviewed, documentary-style, to put the action into context but also to question what really happened. September Crazy Rich Asians Constance Wu, star of Crazy Rich Asians: ‘I’ve lost parts for being outspoken’ Dir: Jon M Chu Based on the colossal bestseller by Kevin Kwan, this blingtastic comedy boasts an almost all-Asian cast. It is the first major Hollywood film to do so since The Joy Luck Club in and has been welcomed as a boisterous corrective to a certain kind of Hollywood racism that renders Asian people invisible. It tells the Cinderella-ish story of Rachel Chu ( Constance Wu ), a smart, hard-working economics professor who discovers her Singaporean boyfriend Nick (Henry Golding) is so mind-bendingly super-rich that it basically embarrassing. She has to impress his formidable mother, played by Michelle Yeoh.

It is garrulous, engaging, revealing. September Climax Dir: Gaspar Noé The adulte terrible Gaspar Noé is back, more lethally brilliant and icily provocative than ever. Or, to put it another way, more infuriating than either fans or detractors will be entirely able to handle. Climax is based (loosely) on the true story of a dance troupe in France who held a party after a rehearsal, drank booze spiked with LSD and then succumbed to a sinister collective freakout. It is like a DJ set from hell, and some of the images Noé contrives are worryingly extreme. The dance moves are sometimes flailingly superhuman.

It first appeared in then famously in as a musical with Judy Garland and James Mason, and then again in with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand. (Its story of sacrificially wounded showbiz maleness also resurfaced in more recent films such as The Artist and La La Land.) Anyway, now A Star Is Born is reborn, with Bradley Cooper directing, and playing a downwardly mobile country star who discovers a wonderfully talented singer played by Lady Gaga . October First Man Dir: Damien Chazelle Damien Chazelle , Hollywood youthful boy wonder, tackles an authentic American icon: Neil Armstrong , the first man on the moon. Ryan Gosling plays that Adam of US history, Corey Stoll is Buzz Aldrin, and Claire Foy plays Armstrong first wife, Janet Shearon . Chazelle will have his work cut out to measure up to Ron Howard superbly watchable space drama Apollo which had Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell. (Pablo Schreiber – ­Nick Sobotka from The Wire – plays Lovell for Chazelle.) October Dogman Dir: Matteo Garrone This new film returns Italian director Matteo Garrone to the world of gangsterism he portrayed in his film Gomorrah . It is a compelling opera of beta-male criminal martyrdom, inspired by a true case. Marcello Fonte won a prize at Cannes for his portrayal of Marcello, who runs a dog-grooming salon in a small Italian town and deals cocaine on the side. Then one of his loyal customers, a brutish bully called Simone with a brain addled by the white powder, forces Marcello into helping him with burglaries. Gripping, horrible and tragic. October Peterloo Dir: Mike Leigh We are approaching the anniversary of the Peterloo massacre , when British soldiers attacked an unarmed democracy rally of in St Peter Field in Manchester: an act of aggressive folly which was to be a long-term spur to parliamentary reform and radical campaigning journalism – leading, in fact, to the creation of this newspaper, originally called the Manchester Guardian. Now Mike Leigh has written and directed a drama based on these events, with Rory Kinnear as the radical orator Henry Hunt. November Wajib Dir: Annemarie Jacir Bethlehem-born film-maker Annemarie Jacir made the heartfelt and engaging drama When I Saw You, about Palestinian children in Jordanian refugee camps after the war. Now she returns with Wajib (the title translates as “Duty”), a father-son drama set in Nazareth. A young architect who lives abroad comes home to help his father with the traditional task of hand-delivering invitations to his sister wedding, and in the process has to sort out his own family issues. September King of Thieves Dir: James Marsh The bizarre true-crime story of the ageing London villains who pulled off an extraordinary heist in London Hatton Garden jewellery district in cries out for a geezer-ish Britmovie treatment. In fact, one has already been made . But now the guv’nor himself has given his imprimatur: Michael Caine stars in this new adaptation with Tom Courtenay, Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent – and Ray Winstone representing the fresh-faced younger generation. September Lucky Dir: John Carroll Lynch The late Harry Dean Stanton made one of his final performances in this plangent and thoughtful movie from actor-turned-director John Carroll Lynch. Stanton plays the eponymous Lucky, an old man meditating on the nature of mortality, fate and life itself. Stanton affecting appearance is not far from his breakthrough performance in Wim Wenders Paris, Texas . David Lynch contributes a cameo. September The Rider Dir: Chloé Zhao Chloé Zhao The Rider is a feature that straddles the worlds of documentary and fiction; a drama that uses non-professionals and draws upon their real lives. It an indie-realist slice of Americana, a tale of cowboys and bronco riders in South Dakota. A young rider called Brady is recovering after a bad accident – the sort of thing which has left a friend of his severely disabled. It is a gentle, slow-moving film which is in no hurry to reveal its truths: an immensely cherishable piece of work. September Never Here Dir: Camille Thoman Sam Shepard final performance is to be found in this enigmatic metaphysical drama-thriller from the former documentary director and UK theatre performer Camille Thoman. Mireille Enos plays conceptual artist Miranda Hall, who is in a relationship with her agent Paul (Shepard). Her latest creation is about voyeurism and surveillance, and stems from a stranger smartphone that she found (unlocked) in the street. Having used the personal information in it as the basis of an exhibition, to its owner rage, she now wonders if she is herself being tracked. September The Little Stranger Dir: Lenny Abrahamson A ghost story of the classic English sort is on offer in this movie based on the novel by Sarah Waters , whose Fingersmith was so memorably transformed into the Korean film The Handmaiden . It is set in the pinched and austere years after the war, and country doctor Faraday (Domhnall Gleeson) makes a visit to a strange, old house, where he makes the acquaintance of a young woman, Caroline (Ruth Wilson), and discovers a terrible secret. September The Captain Dir: Robert Schwentke This movie by German director Robert Schwenke, shot in stark monochrome, is based on the grisly true story of Willi Herold, a German soldier on the run from the authorities at the end of the second world war. He accidentally discovered an officer uniform and then brazened out his own situation by pretending to be an officer on precisely the same mission as those on his tail – and ended by executing hundreds of prisoners. A tough, bleak watch. September The Wife Dir. Björn Runge Glenn Close gives perhaps the best performance of her career in his hugely enjoyable black comedy. In The Wife, adapted from the novel by Meg Wolitzer, she play Joan, , the supportive wife of a world-famous author, Joe (Jonathan Pryce), whose conceited literary celebrity becomes even more insufferable when he wins the Nobel prize. Joan is a former creative-writing student of Joe who tells interviewers that she quite happy to have abandoned her own writerly aspirations and devoted herself to her husband. But that is not true. September Mandy Dir: Panos Cosmatos Here is a film to divide audiences. Some have found it mesmeric, others unbearable. Nicolas Cage stars in this sci-fi horror, futuristic in its way, although set in Cage plays a guy whose life has been destroyed by a marauding gang of sadistic satanic cultists who have killed everyone dear to him. The spectacle of Cage set on violent revenge, with his face covered in blood, is not something to be taken lightly. October Widows Dir: Steve McQueen Connoisseurs of Brit crime have a place in their hearts for Widows, Lynda LaPlante post-Sweeney TV show about the widows of a criminal gang, killed during an armed robbery, who take over their late husbands’ business. Now Steve McQueen (Hunger, Years a Slave) has directed a feature film version with Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo as the widows themselves. Hopes are very high for this. November Disobedience Dir: Sebastián Lelio Chilean film-maker Sebastián Lelio makes his English-language debut with this intensely controlled drama. Rachel Weisz plays a young woman who has to make an uneasy homecoming with the death of her father,an Orthodox rabbi, against whose strict values she was rebelling. Now she finds things very tense with her old friends, who have embraced the religious conservatism she rejected.

26,"Casino Royale Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Even a cameo from Orson Welles couldn’t lend lustre to this pointless and unfunny spoof, a dire tongue-in-cheeker that slipped past the franchise control of the producers, Eon. David Niven saunters unsexily as the retired “Sir James Bond” in this chaotic film. Die Another Day Oh lawdy. The Bond franchise was looking lost in the grim and joyless new “war on terror”-era, and this movie featured the worst gadget in the history of an invisible car. What on earth is the point of that? You can almost see the being pressed into Brosnan hand. The Living Daylights This was the turn of straight actor and RSC stalwart Timothy Dalton. He was supposedly there to give Bond a hard and gritty new seriousness, but always just looked a bit humourless. This was during the Aids era of sexual restraint, too, so Bond only cops off a couple of times. Licence to Kill Bond goes rogue, and Dalton stays dull. This one is notable for the young Benicio del Toro as a humble henchman. After this, legal copyright rows caused a six-year production hiatus during which Dalton quit. For Your Eyes Only You can hear a whistling and a crackling in the air as Roger Moore begins to tune out. The stunts hold up, but Moore is on the exit ramp and his flaccid relationship with Carole Bouquet is a deathly embarrassment. Never Say Never Again The title is what Connery agent should have shouted at him when he was offered the comeback: (“Never”! Say “Never”! Again!) Connery lumbers back for the remake of Thunderball that no one wanted or needed. He was never a six-pack guy at the best of times, but he out of condition here. One to forget. Quantum of Solace Much mocked at the time, this film wasn’t as bad as that – despite the silliest title in the series’ history. Craig is always watchable and Mathieu Amalric is a very eccentric oddball villain. The World Is Not Enough Not bad, but some of the fizz has gone. In this film, the distinction between villain and henchman seems to collapse with three bad guys: Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane and, erm, Goldie, who was very big in those days. GoldenEye Was it a Bondaissance? A Brosnanaissance? Whatever. Stylish yet assertive smoothie Pierce Brosnan had already made an impression in the TV caper Remington Steele. He took to Bond like a duck to water: virile, cool, nice suits. Judi Dench made her debut as M. Bond was back! A View to a Kill Quite unexpectedly, Moore pulled it back a bit for his last hurrah. (It was also, sadly, the last hurrah for Lois Maxwell Miss Moneypenny.) Christopher Walken was always destined to play a Bond villain and it came to pass in this film, as the evil electronics mogul Max Zorin. A good note for Moore to bow out on. Moonraker A whopping, megabudget Bond in its day, clearly influenced by the Star Wars-led sci-fi revival. It is all about the theft of a space shuttle, but this excursion into space can’t conceal the fact that Moore is looking a bit jaded. On Her Majesty Secret Service George Lazenby sole appearance wasn’t a bad Bond. Had he done more, Lazenby might have become a favourite. Diana Rigg played the woman who shows is no commitmentphobe. They marry, before gunfire poignantly restores Bond eternal singledom. Diamonds Are Forever Uh-oh. Connery was tempted back to the role with a big pay packet, now looking craggier and toupeed. Ernst Blofeld, boringly played by Charles Gray, wants to use diamonds to focus his space laser. Bond girl Tiffany Case was played by Jill St John, whose real-life boyfriend, Henry Kissinger, would have been better as the villain. Tomorrow Never Dies It took a spanking from Titanic at the box office, but this is a good, underrated Bond: one of the very few films (or plays or books) to satirise Rupert Murdoch and his Chinese expansionist plans – a rather taboo subject in media. Jonathan Pryce has great fun with the role of the villainous mogul. Octopussy Outrageously daft, but silly and fun. Roger Moore wears a gorilla costume. The Spy Who Loved Me This has a well-loved Bond song, Carly Simon Nobody Does It Better. It also introduced us to the exotic henchman Jaws. The action opens with that staggering skiing-off-a-cliff stunt, just after Moore is seen supposedly skiing in front of an obvious back projection. The Man With the Golden Gun Despite iffy reviews at the time, this has one of the very best villains, wonderfully played by Christopher Lee: Scaramanga, he of the creepy third nipple. It is a preposterous fuel-crisis drama about a solar energy device. There some funky martial arts, too. Skyfall An excellent, intelligent Bond which shrewdly expanded the role of Judi Dench M, developed her relationship with and created a plausible, sympathetic backstory for him. Javier Bardem got his teeth into the villain role. Live and Let Die And so began the reign of Roger Moore, tacitly conceding the campness that many saw as unavoidable for Bond. Moore was witty, sprightly and a mature when he took over (Connery had started at This movie has a great song from Paul McCartney and Wings. Thunderball The evil organisation Spectre had its first appearance in Fleming Thunderball novel, but we were used to it by now, this being the fourth outing for on the big screen. Good stuff here, but the franchise faltered a bit, with long underwater sequences. Spectre Boom! Craig and director Sam Mendes bring off an absolutely storming extravaganza, kicking off with a head-banging action sequence in Mexico City. Léa Seydoux has a Veronica Lake-type sultriness and Ben Whishaw almost steals the show as the geeky Q. Casino Royale Daniel Craig had to face a lot of internet bickering when he was cast, but he blew everyone away with a performance that was just right: cool, cruel, ruthless, yet sardonic. It was great at the time and looks even better now. One of the best Bonds. Dr No Sean Connery first outing in the Bond role. It gave us the gun-barrel titles and the Monty Norman theme. There was Ursula Andress in the bikini and the exotic Johnny Foreigner villain with an outrageous island lair. From Russia With Love Weirdly ungadgety and downbeat. Connery searches his hotel room for bugs for what seems like minutes, with the theme music playing deafeningly. There a great train fight with Robert Shaw Red Grant. Goldfinger “You eckshpect me to talk?” “No, Mr Bond, I expect you to DIE!” This introduced us to Bond Aston Martin and the weird spectacle of Shirley Eaton suffocating in gold. It established the convention whereby the villain leaves time to escape some elaborate automated death. You Only Live Twice This great action movie put Connery Bond right back on top and introduced us to the Nehru-suit-wearing, cat-stroking master criminal Spectre chief, Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence. Connery announced his intention to quit after this. Perhaps he knew it could never be this good again?",1186,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/24/james-bond-on-film-ranked
27,"olish director Paweł Pawlikowski was born in Warsaw in his father a doctor and his mother a ballerina, and moved to the UK at the age of In he directed My Summer of Love , starring Emily Blunt, and in his film Ida won the Oscar for best foreign language film. This year he won the award for best director at Cannes for Cold War , a drama loosely inspired by his parents’ lives during the Soviet era, in cinemas Friday. Festival Sarajevo film festival I’ve just come back from this – a wonderful festival in a haunting city, with Turkish, Austro-Hungarian and Yugoslav heritage and architecture mixed up in a unique way. When you watch films in a place where history feels so palpable and recent, they acquire a different resonance. I made a documentary ( Serbian Epics ) in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war and went there many times before and after. So the festival brought back a lot of memories. It was a very vibrant multicultural city before the war. The festival manages to recreate that spirit, if only for a couple of weeks. Film No Man Land ( dir: Danis Tanović, ) While at the festival, back at the hotel I showed my wife this Bosnian film, which won an Oscar years ago. It a powerful tragicomic tale set in the trenches of the Bosnian war. Part realist drama, part a timeless Beckettian parable, it about two soldiers from opposite sides trapped in a murderous Catch situation. The experience of the Bosnian war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia feels incredibly relevant these days in Europe, so it definitely worth thinking about. Book Dorota Masłowska “Inni ludzie” (Other People) I’m just reading this wonderful book, which is a kind of polyphonic poem in rapping verse, where characters are cartoonish and the real protagonist is language. Masłowska exploded on to the Polish literary scene at the tender age of but far from being a flash in the pan, she goes from strength to strength with each book. It a hilarious, though deeply melancholy poem about the erosion of Polish society: the cars are expensive, relations cheap, aspirations are high and motives low. Documentary Sergey Dvortsevoy Bread Day; Paradise; In the Dark Dvortsevoy films are unique – he reinvented documentary-making for me. He makes films about people trying to eke out an existence in a post-Soviet world – mainly Kazakhstan and Russia – but it the way they’re done that makes them masterpieces. He does long takes, with no cuts or directorial manipulation, conjuring up scenes where twists and punchlines emerge with God-given grace. He gets there by shooting for a long time and waiting for as long as it takes for reality to reveal its dramatic shape. Music Taco Hemingway I’d never heard of Taco Hemingway, but it turns out he a huge cult figure in Poland among young people. His agent called me because Taco wanted to use the dialogue from a scene in Cold War in one of his songs, called in Girona . So I listened to some of his work and I thought it was great – his music has a trance-like mood, but above all he really inventive with words and he does have something to say too. And via him my stepson introduced me to another rapper, a guy called Tyler, the Creator , who pretty brilliant and out there. Opera Madama Butterfly at Polish National Opera Something that really stunned me not long ago was this production, directed by [Mariusz] Treliński. It was an extraordinary piece of opera, beautifully realised and very original. I love the music of Madama Butterfly anyway, but it very difficult to give it a form that makes you enter that world, and see music as more than just music. Usually in opera I just listen to the greatest hits and let the spectacle wash over me a bit, whereas here the spectacle went hand-in-hand with the music rather brilliantly. I was bowled over. Sport The World Cup The truth is that I spent most of the summer watching the World Cup. I watched every game religiously – so this was the main cultural experience of the last two months for me. I was depressed by how badly Poland played – we overhyped the side before the tournament, while they were clearly a team of players in decline. But I loved the team spirit and the lack of narcissism in plucky Japan and Croatia. I loved how they played – how their individual skills (high especially in the case of the Croats) were put at the service of the team, and star status didn’t interfere.",778,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/pawel-pawlikowski-cannes-best-director-cultural-highlights-sergey-dvortsevoy-world-cup-poland
28,"Brubaker Released in the same year as his clunky but multiple Oscar-winning directorial debut Ordinary People , Brubaker showed a tougher side to Redford than anyone had seen before. As a prison warden who goes undercover as an inmate to clean up the penal system, he had to raise his game among some hardened character actors. “The movies I liked making dealt with an America that was a little different from the America that was propagandised,” he said. “There a grey zone that I know, and I want to tell stories about that complex part of America.” The Twilight Zone – “Nothing in the Dark” None of Redford early TV appearances were as haunting as his personification of death in this creepy-sad episode of The Twilight Zone. “You see?” he says, glowing handsomely and gesturing to an old woman dormant body as he leads her spirit into the afterlife. “No shock. No engulfment. No tearing asunder. What you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper. What you thought was the end is the beginning.” The Great Gatsby Before DiCaprio there was Redford: he may never have exuded the pure electricity of the junior actor, and his chemistry with Mia Farrow (as Daisy) was meagre, to say the least, but his permanently distracted air was just right for Jay Gatsby. In the midst of even the most vibrant shindig, he seems uniquely alone. Fame does that to you. Sneakers This underrated techno caper-comedy, about a crack team of computer security experts, was led by Redford and features River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier and Dan Aykroyd. Redford occasional returns to light comedy could be spotty – Legal Eagles should be outlawed – but he having a blast here as the slightly bumbling former radical who has become something of a sellout. Three Days of the Condor Redford most frequent collaborator was the director Sydney Pollack, with whom he made six films including the western Jeremiah Johnson and the Oscar-bait drama Out of Africa Their best, though, was this jittery conspiracy thriller in which Redford, working for a clandestine CIA group, has to be brought in from the cold after his team is massacred. Cherish the justified sense of Watergate-era dread, as well as the opening shot of Redford cycling through traffic in a goofy woolly hat and trainers. All Is Lost Redford, then had only a handful of lines as the nameless, luckless soul (billed as “Our Man”) stuck at sea and sinking fast. The concentrated intensity of this one-man show comes from its star evident vulnerability and his (literally) weatherbeaten face. The director, JC Chandor, pinpointed the poignant power: “Everything is heightened with him being older. He like a bird with a broken wing.” All the President Men The actor wanted to produce this as a small black-and-white thriller with unknowns in the leads. The studio told him: “If you’re gonna do this, then you have to be in it.” Chalk and cheese look like identical twins next to Redford and Dustin Hoffman. And therein lies the restless genius of their casting as, respectively, Bob Woodward (tall, smooth, Waspy) and Carl Bernstein (short, Jewish, fussbudget), the Washington Post reporters blowing Watergate wide open. The Candidate Redford was already chafing against his pretty-boy persona when he starred as a young Democrat hopeful in this satirical comedy. The star told the studio: “I’d like to make a film about the election process – about how we elect somebody based on cosmetics rather than substance.” The result was a film with scruples – and claws. Downhill Racer This superbly stark portrait of the American dream at its coldest, scripted by the great novelist James Salter, began Redford one-for-me, one-for-them strategy: he agreed to mainstream fare such as The Way We Were as long as the studios also backed his smaller, more daring projects. Here, he plays an emotionally arctic skier hungry to win at all costs: a brave performance to give so near the start of his film career, when most actors would want to woo the audience, not disconcert them. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Redford sole Oscar nomination for acting was, rather shockingly, for The Sting , a complacent con-man comedy. But it was his first pairing with Sting co-star Paul Newman that distils the performer essence. Although the movie is unable to fess up to its bromantic longings – did any woman in a buddy movie ever look more like a gooseberry than poor Katharine Ross? – it still worth seeing for Redford sunny charm. Even then, it seemed to trouble him faintly, as though he was worried we might take him for a himbo. The studio did. “He just another California blond,” said one executive. “Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you’ll hit six like him.” But Newman helped win him the part. Redford got a shock when he saw the first cut. “I said: ‘What the hell is that song doing in there? Raindrops? It not even raining. On a bicycle?’”",838,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/09/robert-redfords-greatest-screen-roles-ranked
29,"‘He was a manipulative bully. He would mimic people when he was shouting at them. We were all adults, but made to feel Anonymous, London office I’d had other jobs in the industry before and felt this one, in Harvey Weinstein London office, was a step up. The business was very successful at this point. There was a fairly high turnover of staff; I worked there for just under a year. Harvey loves Europe, and he came to London all the time. He was here days or two weeks in every month. We used to joke, “Thank God Concorde doesn’t exist any more” because at least we had a bit of notice. But he never set foot in the office, ever – business was entirely run from hotels. The office was a dump in Soho, so it didn’t seem unusual. There were two interviews for the job. I got a full briefing in the first interview about him being a bully, from the people who worked with him. I remember giving that same chat myself when I was interviewing later: this is the reality. I think it is a bit alluring – you’re thinking, “I can handle that.” Before my second interview with him, which was at a hotel, I did get warned about him going in to the bathroom and masturbating. But that person was very gossipy and I didn’t think it was realistic – it sounded so out there. I just didn’t believe it, which feels a bit ridiculous now. They made a bit of a joke about him being a perv: “Keep your coat on.” Now I think: didn’t that seem strange, and didn’t that seem wrong? But people were talking affectionately, if eye-rollingly, about him. I didn’t think I could expect better: if everyone else was OK with it, who was I to make a fuss? The conversation with Harvey was very brief, because the person in the London office had already decided they wanted me. He said something I heard him say to a lot of people: “I have a very good instinct. I can always tell when I’m going to get on well with someone.” I was told during my training that you must never lie to Harvey, or even fudge something – he would know. He has x-ray vision, and once he gets the bit between his teeth, he won’t let it go. But he also forgot things people had said only moments before, or went back on some big declaration he had just made, occasionally to his advantage. There were two parts to the job. The real work had very little to do with him: there were a lot of projects, attending festivals, trying to meet film-makers and writers. And there was the other part, which was his visits and dealing with him. It felt like everyone was his assistant. The philosophy was that the company runs best when Harvey is happy, so you have to make sure things run smoothly. Meetings were made and cancelled or moved or ran late, at the drop of a hat, and he’d be furious with us even though he had caused it. Weekends weren’t relevant, evenings were not relevant, breakfast meetings were scheduled for after being up till My days were rarely the same, the only constant being that they were chaotic and adrenalised. You would end up being proud of the strangest things, like getting through the day without being screamed at, or without him publicly abusing someone else – a waiter, a colleague, a director, a driver. It was a horrible feeling to be screamed at or “fired” (he threatened this multiple times a day). But it was far worse to see him abuse someone else. Fighting back didn’t work with him, really, but you could intervene on someone else behalf and draw his fire. It was like tending to a giant, belligerent, disgusting baby. His moods dictated so much that you constantly thought about whether he was tired, hungry, thirsty, cold. Sometimes he’d scream at you in front of someone you respected, and it bothers me to this day that they'd let it pass I got told early on that he had girlfriends. Sometimes he would want them invited to things, or to send a car. Some were actresses, some I don’t know what they did. He was part of a rich-person circuit and a few of the women were connected to that. We’d never know when a girlfriend was going to turn up, or when we’d have to lie to his wife. But he would be happier afterwards. Now I worry those interactions were not necessarily what I took them to be. His first visit to London was a few weeks after I started. His family were on the trip, and that was quite challenging. You are being told that it not your job [to look after them], but aware that they need to be kept amused and happy. He never, ever stopped working, and that was a bit sad to see. We used to say that he was either working or whoring: he barely slept. Part of the reason there is a culture of silence, which is not unique to Harvey Weinstein , is that in this industry you can be made to feel a bit prudish if you are uncomfortable. This was definitely his cover: that it was nobody business if he was cheating on his wife. I saw him become obsessed with the odd A-list actress, promising to win them an Oscar. But these were not private meetings. There were always plenty of people in the room. I haven’t spoken to the press before. I felt this wasn’t about me: it is for those people who have alleged assault to take up the story. But I don’t want to be in the business of protecting the Weinstein company, either. And my perspective is useful. I can completely believe that people who worked for him didn’t know about the extent of his conduct. He was a horrible, manipulative bully; he would mimic people when he was shouting at them. We were all adults, but you were made to feel You had to think about it really carefully: how much is this job worth? I used to have this horrible feeling of, what if my partner or family saw me when he was yelling at me? It would be very humiliating. And this was all the time – not in the heat of production. You couldn’t believe the good things that he said because then you had to believe the bad things, too. You had to say to yourself: this is him freaking out, it not my fault. Fairly often his screaming involved a boast about himself: I can call the president, and I can call this person. He was telling us how important he was, and it was tiring but we would laugh about it afterwards. Sometimes he’d scream at you in front of someone you respected or had worked with, and that bothers me to this day – that they would let it pass. Everyone wanted to get their movie made, and I understand that; but I feel sick that his bullying was allowed to flourish in public and no one ever said, “This isn’t acceptable.” If you raised it, you were laughed off as naive; there was the underlying feeling that maybe you just weren’t good enough to really impress him. This was – bluntly – bullshit. Plenty of stupid people could rise through the ranks, and plenty of great people were lost to the company because of Harvey bullying. I think behaving as outrageously as he did, and no one doing more than shaking their head or laughing nervously, made him believe he had all the power. He felt untouchable. There was the odd male assistant. They were always quite tall and good-looking, and they were resented and envied by Harvey. His insecurities were close to the surface, and his awareness that he was not an attractive man was quite evident. He also felt less able to bully them – or maybe the bullying took a different form. He was good at currying favour. He would hunt down a first edition to send to someone with a note: “We should make this sometime.” I would see him with some people – actresses, film-makers – and think, “This does feel like grooming” and hope they knew what they were getting into. I would look at some of the people and think: this is not right – they were not likely to be actually professionally good. There were people who would do two or three meetings and then say, “I’m not doing this again.” He would be asking them to come, and they would be busy, and alarm bells would be ringing. In those instances I think they had twigged what was coming. We were all across his email. We just thought he was an intensely energetic philanderer – we’d joke about the amount of people who wanted to sleep with him. There were a lot; it didn’t feel as if he was only a predator. Women would come up to him, give him their numbers – very, very beautiful women, models and actresses. We would work in the car with one of Harvey girlfriends there. They felt like transactional relationships, although he never really carried cash. I don’t want to imply I don’t believe those who have come forward, because all those accounts make so much sense now. It horrible; how could none of us have connected the severity of his bullying with how that might be expressed through his sexual side? I didn’t love the role of keeping the family busy: that felt a bit gross. It was not explicit, but we had to make sure that his wife or kids should not go to his hotel room: “It not a good time.” I was part of that; we all endorsed and stood beside him. I feel bad about his fixation with certain things, and with two or three famous actresses. He had crushes and would try to insist on having meetings without their partners or agents present. Thankfully, those meetings never really transpired. I thought the actresses were the powerful ones. Now, I wonder. He used to say, “See me like a king. I’m your pass to places.” He learned the things you wanted from the job, and he would hold that over you as a carrot, to do better. But I left because life was too short. We were coming up to a round of festivals and I thought, I am not getting much out of this. And I was beginning to feel a sense of shame I couldn’t put my finger on. I had wanted to be the sort of person who could “handle it”, but emotionally I couldn’t. I was very adrenalised and nervous all the time. I had to leave before I got fired. Harvey Weinstein is not the only monster on the hill that we need to kill. The culture that allowed him to hide in plain sight still needs to be addressed, and I think that barely begun. It should be embarrassing for people to scream at employees, for the fate of an entire company to rest on a bully whims. If he hadn’t been able to steamroller and abuse people for so long, his other, far worse behaviour might have been called out much earlier. Perhaps people are more nervous of sexual harassment lawsuits now. But I think the bullying and the culture of silence around it still flourishes. ‘A colleague came into the office one day, saying, “Call the police, Harvey just attacked me!” That was probably his last day’ Mark Lipsky, New York office I worked for the Weinsteins three separate times, between and When I came on board, it was in a two-bedroom apartment on Broadway, with Harvey in one bedroom and [his brother] Bob in the other, and half a dozen of us in the living room. That was Miramax. They did with me what they went on to do with many, many people: they offered me a position that no other employer would have done. I came in as the head of sales and marketing. They were very good at handing out titles that were unavailable elsewhere, and at that point they owned you. Where were you going to go? You would see some terrible stuff. I remember one time Harvey was holding a meeting in a conference room. It was standing room only. And he just went off at this woman, calling her a man name – Richard or something. It wasn’t even a name that could have gone either way. It was completely psychotic. In this overcrowded room of people who had got so used to the insanity, there wasn’t a whole lot of surprise. I don’t know what the effect was on that woman, but it couldn’t have been good. It fairly well-known that Bob was even scarier than Harvey. There was a moment at Miramax when we had this awful movie, this unwatchable movie, that had to be released in order to satisfy a video deal. In the late videos were where the money was. We had to do whatever it took to get this film opened in three or four or five markets and then throw it at the video company and get a cheque. One of those cities was Seattle and I had to commit to a certain level of advertising to get the theatre to book it, and I did. Bob came into my office one morning and said, “We’re not spending any money on that movie. Call them up and cancel ads.” And I said no: I had made the commitment. Bob got more and more frustrated. I had a cup of pencils on my desk and he started taking a pencil out of the cup, breaking it, and throwing it on the floor. One after the other after the other, and saying something to me that I still can’t understand. “Are you tight? Are you tight now?” I was bemused. Sort of enjoying the show almost. Not a lot of people left in my time. I was one of the few. We had someone senior who came running into the office one morning. Big guy, lovely guy. Red and sweating, and saying, “Someone call the police, Harvey just attacked me.” He said Harvey attacked him on the street in front of the office. That was probably his last day. I don’t think anyone called the police. It was always Harvey and Bob against the world. They trusted no&nbsp;one, and in the end, they didn’t even trust each other They made every girl in the office cry. There were lots of apologies and flowers. I wasn’t around it as it festered. My jaw didn’t exactly hit the floor when I started reading the accusations [last October], but it got halfway there. I believed everything was true, but the degree of depravity was surprising. The irony of ironies was that they distributed a documentary called Bully, and Harvey talked about how bullying was a terrible thing. He virtually invented bullying. For me, it was largely educational. It made me better at navigating questionable personal relationships. I’m a straight shooter, but there were lessons to be learned in terms of how to manoeuvre and how to survive under adverse conditions. I would shout back at them, but most people didn’t. They ruled with an iron fist, and you did not want to lose your job because it was a great job, except for the poisonous environment. People could escape it physically; that the only way they were able to keep some of their top executives, because they were miles away in California. That eventually changed, because it got so big and there was so much money that Harvey was essentially bi-coastal and miles meant nothing. What they did best was negotiate. They were great negotiators, and even better renegotiators. They would hammer you and hammer you. And the next day come back and say, “No, that not good enough.” That was the way they approached life. It was them against the world, or the world against them. They were such bad managers and so paranoid that there was no room for trust, even for people who were close to them in business. It was always only ever Harvey and Bob, fighting the good fight. They trusted no one but each other, and eventually, they didn’t even trust each other. ‘Harvey insisted on being present when we signed an NDA. It was distressing and intimidating. He apologised, essentially an admission’ Zelda Perkins, London office It was when I left Miramax in and tried to pursue justice that the scales really fell from my eyes; in some ways, the real abuse started then. I began working for Harvey when I was only and didn’t really know who he was; partly through my naivety, partly through my upbringing, I happened to have the right set of tools in my personality to deal with him. I simply saw him as an unpleasant, lascivious boss and so treated him as such. I didn’t initially understand his power, or see him as the key to my future, which were the things that made so many others vulnerable to him. But the challenge turned into a nightmare when a new colleague alleged Harvey had tried to rape her while we were at the Venice film festival . I had employed her to assist me, so she was my responsibility; once she told me, there was no possibility of us continuing to work for him. On going to lawyers we were told, to our horror, that our only realistic option was to make a damages claim and enter into an agreement. They told me it wasn’t worth considering going to court. It became increasingly apparent that this had little to do with justice and everything to do with money and power. I had presumed the law was above all men, but the disparity of my position and Harvey trumped whatever he had done; the ensuing legal process ultimately broke my belief in the core values of our culture. That is more seismic than having your belief broken in one individual. Miramax was represented by one of the most powerful “magic circle” law firms on the globe, Allen &amp; Overy. Even though the allegations were of a serious criminal nature, a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) was negotiated that, as far as I can see, was wholly unethical. The agreement includes things that were legally extraordinary. Under its terms, my colleague and I would not be able to speak to a doctor, counsellor or accountant about what had happened, without them also signing an NDA, which we would be held accountable to if they broke it. The most sinister of these clauses stipulated that I was to use my “best endeavours” not to disclose anything in a civil or criminal case brought against Weinstein. In other words, I was to keep quiet, whatever the circumstances, for ever. The NDA took hours of complex and stressful negotiations in Allen &amp; Overy offices. The experience was one of complete siege mentality, with sessions lasting up to hours. On one day, after a full morning negotiations, we resumed at and finished at the next day. You lost track of time and space. We were two young women shut in a room full of lawyers talking in legal riddles, and we were not able to tell anyone what we were doing. From the beginning, it was imperative to me that money never changed hands. But it was made very clear that a financial demand was the standard and only formula. At this point, our entire motivation became focused on the fact that, if we could not prosecute Harvey, then we had to stop his behaviour and protect people in the future, in exchange for our silence. Other obligations that were agreed were that Harvey would have to attend therapy for three years, and that Miramax would be forced to inform Disney (its parent company) or fire him if any further settlements were attempted. I don’t believe anyone had tried to do this before; it seems clear from the horrifying list of further allegations that have since emerged that his side of the agreement was not upheld. I always felt we were being made to do something we didn’t want to do. However, it wasn’t a simple situation and it was not just about me. My colleague was in a very psychologically vulnerable position, having experienced extreme trauma in the first few weeks of her job, and we were being given frightening advice with few options. I had no choice but to do what our lawyers were telling us, even if it wasn’t what I wanted to hear. Harvey insisted on being present on the day we signed the agreement. He apologised for his behaviour and offered us anything we wanted to return to the company. This was the first time my colleague had seen him since the attempted rape and it was obviously very distressing and intimidating. There seemed to be no protection within the system to stop this. His words that day were essentially an admission, all of which was noted down by our lawyer. But when we got up to leave, Harvey team insisted the notes be destroyed. Harvey Weinstein: the women who have accused him My film career came to a halt after that. It a small industry, and there were whispers and rumours. No one knew what had happened, of course, but after several uncomfortable interviews, it became clear people didn’t want to risk upsetting Harvey, and I couldn’t defend my reputation. My goal now is to ensure that NDAs cannot be weaponised and used to hide criminal behaviour. Law firms have been enabling questionable behaviour and making money out of these agreements. And this is not just limited to sexual harassment; it is far more insidious within our work culture. My NDA would have been unenforceable, but this was never made clear to me and I lived in fear of it for years – until last year. I felt I had been criminalised and that, if I spoke, I would be the one going to jail. There will always be characters like Weinstein; we can’t deny the existence of charismatic, sociopathic and dangerous characters, and they seem to people the top echelons of most businesses. But as a society, we have a responsibility to make sure that employees are protected – and that if they are abused, they have true recourse. There is a place for NDAs, but they have become an immoral tool, legally used to silence victims. The circumstances in which they are created need to be carefully examined, and regulated. Earlier this year, I gave evidence to MPs at a select committee inquiry to examine sexual harassment in the workplace, and the improper use of NDAs. The lawyer who negotiated my NDA from Allen &amp; Overy gave evidence immediately after me. I was sitting right behind him, watching his neck getting redder and redder as he was asked whether he had produced an agreement that could pervert the course of justice. I got terrible nervous giggles, because I hadn’t expected the MPs to be so aggressive. Unfortunately, the representative sent to the inquiry from Simons Muirhead &amp; Burton (my solicitors years earlier) had not been involved with my case. My argument was not with the individual lawyers, nor even with the firms. My argument is with the fact that they were doing something apparently legal. A positive thing to have emerged from the inquiry is that the Solicitors Regulation Authority is now investigating; this, and the recommendations made by the select committee, mean there is a real chance that significant change will come. If power and money put you above the law, then the law is worth nothing. And that, fundamentally, is more frightening and dangerous than an ego out of control.

30,"man stands on the stage. The sun is setting on his career but he is – for now – still in the spotlight. He suddenly reaches out into the shadows and plucks a woman from the crowd. She takes the spotlight from him, and he self-destructs into oblivion. Hollywood is built on remakes and reinventions, but the most interesting and certainly the longest-running of these first emerged more than a decade before the first Superman movie. A Star Is Born , which gets its fourth outing next week after months of ecstatic hype, is now years old and has starred, in its various incarnations, increasingly improbable pairings: Janet Gaynor and Fredric March in the original; Judy Garland and James Mason in the remake; Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in the version; and now Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Often described as a Pygmalion story, A Star Is Born is more like Cinderella, with the leading man playing not just the fairy godmother who gives the woman a makeover, but the prince who marries her and finally the wicked stepmother who needs to be destroyed so the woman can live happily ever after. One of the most striking things about the Star Is Born films is how faithful the versions have been to what came before them. The storyline has remained steadfastly unchanged and certain scenes and even some lines reverberate between each one (the already heavily memed exchange between Cooper and Gaga from the new trailer, in which he tells her to turn around “so I can take another look at you”, is straight out of both the and versions). The gender politics of the films has remained almost defiantly untouched by feminism second, third and fourth waves, as they all suggest that the woman success emasculates, even feminises, the man. In the version he makes dinner so it is ready for when she comes home from work, to her embarrassment; in the and films she puts makeup on him as her career starts to eclipse his. In all of them, a happy ending of sorts is achieved when, at the end, she introduces herself to her fans by her married name. You don’t come to A Star Is Born for subtlety. The remakes all follow a template, too: the female lead is played by a singer-performer who has a lot to prove to the public, while the leading male role is dumped on some poor schmuck forced to accept that he will be very much the second fiddle here. The Star Is Born quasi-franchise is wheeled out almost every years, meaning we can chart shifting attitudes towards fame over the course of what is now almost a century. (For some reason, the series skipped the unless you count The Bodyguard as the Star Is Born from that decade, which I very much do.) Each remake says more than it realises about its stars, and more than it means to about its stars’ feelings about their fans. Look how we suffer for you, our ungrateful public, each film says, and the public continues to love the movies for it. Meanwhile, the behind-the-scenes stories from the movies are invariably more illuminating than the onscreen one. So whether the movies are wonderful terrible or shameless awards bait they are each extraordinarily revealing about the times in which they were made, and the people who made them. The most interesting thing about the film is how much it was rooted in actual biography. Multiple famous men from that era have been cited as the inspiration for the alcoholic and ultimately suicidal leading man, including Barbara Stanwyck husband, Frank Fay, and Colleen Moore husband, John McCormick, as well as several silent movie stars whose careers tanked when talkies arrived. A Star Is Born , in its original form, is a sly indictment of the toll Hollywood takes on men, and for extra measure it lobs some pointed jokes at Hollywood women. While Gaynor character is presented as a blameless ingenue, the movie takes potshots at some of the biggest – and most independent – female stars around in that era, including Mae West and Katharine Hepburn (I’ve always suspected that some of these shots came from the acerbic pistol of Dorothy Parker, who co-wrote the script). This movie is the dark sister of Singin’ in the Rain, a far more rose-tinted version of what became of actors back then in Hollywood when time and technology overtook them and women became the more powerful celebrities. It is an anxious gasp about male irrelevancy and female ascendancy. Which brings us to the remakes, which should be titled A Star Is Reborn, as in each one the female lead was already a huge star but, for wildly different reasons, needed a new kind of acceptance from the public. Judy Garland version is indebted to the original – the leading characters even have the same names – but this is very much Garland movie, on every possible level. It was her first film in four years, and her desperation for it to be a success echoes her character desire for a big break. She plays Esther Blodgett, an aspiring singer, who is spotted by a Hollywood star and notorious drunk, Norman Maine (beautifully acted by James Mason), who launches her career and then, after marrying her, nearly destroys it. This epic three-hour movie is rightly considered a masterpiece, but the layers of irony within it make it almost unwatchably poignant: various studio executives tell Esther what is wrong with her face, just as they did to Garland as a child, cursing her with a lifetime of insecurities; Esther practises saying the name given to her by the studio, Vicki Lester, just as Garland – born Frances Ethel Gumm – must have once had to do. Most obviously of all, Esther frequently pleads with her husband to stop abusing his poor body, just as those around Garland pleaded with her. In probably the most famous scene , she tearfully asks: “What is it – what is it that makes someone want to destroy themselves?” while her already raddled face – which looks at least a decade older than her years – is a testament to how Garland was destroying herself while making the film. Over the course of the shoot her behaviour became more erratic and her lateness drove the film already unthinkable budget of ever upwards. Garland life was divided between the two characters in the movie: the young hopeful from the past, whom she was playing, and the used-up, broken-down addict from the present, at whom she had to stare while acting opposite. Her fans in the film go from cheering her every song at the beginning to ripping the veil off her face at a funeral to see her at her worst; it not hard to guess from this movie how Garland felt about the public. She was also all too aware of the parallels between herself and the characters, and this worsened her mental state. The director George Cukor wrote to Hepburn during the shoot: “About three weeks ago, strange, sinister and sad things began happening to Judy. [She is like] someone unhinged.” It probably did not help that Garland then husband, Sidney Luft, bought all the furniture from the movie at the end of the shoot and put it in their house, meaning Garland ended up living inside her own movie, with all its sense of predestined doom. According to Lorna Luft , Garland and Luft daughter, A Star Is Born “cost my mother, emotionally, a great deal. It cost my parents – it affected their marriage. It was sort of art imitating life imitating art.” The presence of Sidney Luft makes this film an especially strange double game. Luft was an odd Hollywood figure, a former boxer who married Garland, and he is listed as producer of the movie. Their relationship is a gender reversal of the one in the movie: she gave him his Hollywood break, and he then had to look after her. He didn’t look after her enough: they divorced and Garland died at only of an accidental overdose. If the version of A Star Is Born is about Hollywood tragic underbelly, then the version is about its ludicrously narcissistic top coat. Just as Garland then husband pitched the movie as her comeback and was made producer, so Streisand then boyfriend conceived this movie as her relaunch, and installed himself in the producer seat. But whereas Luft was a relatively normal person, Streisand boyfriend, Jon Peters, is an extraordinary character. He met Streisand when he was hired as her hairdresser on another movie and not only became her boyfriend but used his relationship with her to make this movie and then go on to become one of the most powerful and divisive men in Hollywood. If any star was ever born out of the Star Is Born franchise, that star is Peters; he even listed as the producer of the version, proving that not only are stars born, some of them never go away. Peters wanted the public to see Streisand as sexy and hip and this movie, he believed, was the solution. They decided to set it in the music industry, and after Neil Diamond and – mindbogglingly – Elvis Presley fell through as the male lead, Kris Kristofferson, Streisand ex, was cast in the thankless role of the pickled rocker. This could have been a fantastic film, one that reflected the sexual revolution among the rock’n’roll generation, topped off with Streisand all-conquering voice. Unfortunately, if predictably, Peters’ and Streisand supersized egos got in the way and jettisoned that. They were so difficult that the movie director, Frank Pierson, wrote an article about them before the film even came out, in which he described Streisand constant complaints that there weren’t enough closeups of her, and Peters’ hopeless ineptitude as a producer. Streisand was too narcissistic to include all the frailties that made Garland character so unforgettable and instead she became the least credible ingenue ever committed to screen. Far from being amazed when she is lifted from obscurity to superstardom, her character acts like it is completely her due. She also dresses like someone from an older, stuffier era (“Nobody told her that people now wear jeans sometimes,” Roger Ebert wrote in his review .) The public barely features in the film; when Streisand looks out of car windows, what she sees is her own reflection. As inadvertent psychological studies go, it a doozy – a souvenir from a time when Hollywood could throw away money on movies that were made less for the audience and more for the stars. Bradley Cooper, who directs and stars in the latest film, had the good sense to not make the mistake of his predecessors and so didn’t involve his partner in the film. Instead, in Lady Gaga , he found someone willing to be as vulnerable as Garland but with Streisand screen-hogging presence, making her character transition to global superstar feel credible. To be taken seriously in a movie today, a woman must be made under, not over, and so whereas Streisand was sexed up, Gaga – as the pre-publicity hype refuses to let us forget – goes without her usual makeup and hair product, and looks genuinely terrific. Oscars who are this year early frontrunners? But this film takes far more from Streisand film than Garland. Most obviously, it is set in the music industry, thereby allowing the movie to critique fame without attacking the movie business. Like Streisand before him, Cooper seems to have found that when you make a movie starring yourself the temptation will always be to put your idealised self on the screen. And that is the biggest problem with this otherwise extremely fun movie: both characters, Jack and Ally, are improbably selfless, loving people. The one flaw between them is Jack addictions, but these, Ally reassures him, are not his fault but “a disease”. Even Jack half-hearted jealousy of Ally career is treated as an expression of his alcoholism, as opposed to a natural human emotion. The movie would be a lot more interesting if Cooper had gone for even half of James Mason complexity. But at least Cooper gives his character more backstory than Kristofferson got. He gets at least as much as screen time as Gaga, and it hard not to smile at Cooper gall – at this point in time – for emphasising that one of the most famous stories about female success is really about faded masculinity, but there no doubting that someone becoming unfamous is a more interesting story than someone becoming famous. The movie would be more accurately titled A Star Dies. A Star Is Born review – Lady Gaga mesmerises in Streisand shoes It is also fascinating for what it says about modern fame. The public is either an anonymous crowd or predatory individuals demanding selfies, which is probably how celebrities now see them. By coincidence, or maybe not, Garland, Streisand and Gaga are all gay icons whose gay fans played an enormous part in their success, but only the movie acknowledges this, or even that gay people exist in the entertainment business at all. What comes across in this movie is how strongly the public now think it is their right to be famous, and how much famous people sneer at this belief. A running joke is Ally father (Andrew Dice Clay) repeatedly insisting he is better than Frank Sinatra. Everyone has talent, but only some people have something to say, Jack solemnly tells Ally. And yet the whole message of A Star Is Born is that anyone can be famous, if they just happen to meet a celebrity in a bar. The fantasy of the film depends on maintaining that illusion, but the longevity of A Star Is Born relies on us believing celebrities are special – stars. In the age of reality TV and social media, that weird duality has never felt more relevant. A star is born and another must die – and then another will rise again.",2354,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/28/female-success-and-male-decline-what-a-star-is-born-tells-us-about-fame-fear-and-feminism
31,"here a certain point during Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam (the title translates as The Man Who Saves the World, though the film is generally better known as Turkish Star Wars) when you realise that what you’re watching isn’t like other bad films. It isn’t really like anything else at all. For some, that moment will come when two Turkish space pilots crash-land on a barren planet and the one who looks like Ronnie Wood in a Thriller jacket starts doing a special whistle that no woman can resist. Or perhaps it will be when brightly coloured felt monsters slaughter terrified children in a sequence that suggests a massacre by the cast of Sesame Street. Or it may be right at the start, during an opening voiceover that is convoluted and oddly blase (“However, at some point in time, Earth shattered into pieces …”) But the real mark of distinction, and the audacious touch that has ensured the film notoriety since its release in is that the makers blithely used shots, music and sound effects from other movies. With a budget of and with many of his original spaceship sets having been destroyed in a freak storm, the director, Çetin Inanç, opted instead to simply steal footage from a print of Star Wars, which he projected behind his actors as they sat in their cockpits wearing motorcycle helmets and swaying this way and that to mimic the motion of intergalactic flight. Behind them the Death Star looms, and the Millennium Falcon whizzes past; at one point, the back-projection footage even cuts from one shot to another while the actor in the foreground remains unchanged. Star Wars rip-offs are as numerous as Ewoks, but none has been so cheekily, charmingly brazen. The film has a plot of sorts: the space pilots are pitted against the Wizard, a tyrant in spiky red headgear who needs a human brain to make a weapon that can penetrate Earth force-field. Try as he might, he can’t seem to subdue our heroes. After Cookie Monster and friends fail to do the job, the Wizard dispatches skeletons on horseback, a platoon of mummies and a giant teddy bear with tinsel hanging from its claws. When the Wizard buries the heroes alive, they simply climb out of their graves. There an all-out mummy free-for-all. Then a bar-room brawl with red yetis But none of this matters as much as the film naive tone and its unbridled chutzpah. As well as cannibalised Star Wars, there are chunks of newsreel footage thrown in and unmistakable musical thefts from Flash Gordon, Battlestar Galactica and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Coming across a copy of the movie years ago on Google Video, the film-maker and film historian Ed Glaser was agog. “I’ve never seen a film so brutally, relentlessly entertaining. It keeps chucking unbelievable new things at you. There an all-out mummy free-for-all. Then a training montage where the hero punches rocks and overcomes gravity by strapping boulders to his legs. Then a bar-room brawl with red yetis,” he says. There was every reason to suppose that the film would be consigned to video-sharing platforms and bootleg DVDs for the rest of its days. But in an advertisement appeared online offering a distribution print of The Man Who Saves the World for sale. It turned out that back in the a Turkish projectionist had held on to a copy, claiming that it had been so severely damaged it wasn’t worth returning to the studio. Now it was the only print in existence. “Countless screenings, before and after our heroic projectionist absconded with it, resulted in a lot of wear and tear, with bits and pieces getting chewed up and snipped out,” Glaser says. “So by the time I got hold of it, it was not a pristine print. The colour had faded, and I had to reconstruct parts of it from video sources.” Audiences who see the film on its forthcoming UK tour as part of Scalarama may be surprised by its fruity, overripe richness; any blips, wobbles and imperfections only add to the retro thrill. In a way, the resourcefulness, tenacity and – in the case of that projectionist – sheer gall involved in preserving and reviving Turkish Star Wars mirrors the efforts that İnanç and his cast and crew had to undertake to get the film made in the first place. Glaser even thinks the picture has an inspirational lesson to offer to film-makers everywhere. “Sometimes you have to aim above your means,” he says. “The results can be incredible.” Turkish Star Wars is on tour in the UK from September, click here for details .",774,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/14/attack-of-the-killer-jedi-the-bizarre-story-of-turkish-star-wars
32,"f you watch movies you’ll have seen umpteen deaths, sometimes in a single film. (According to the people who keep a tally of such things, the final Lord of the Rings has cinema highest body count, of more than – though presumably that includes orcs.) But what about the dying process itself? What happens to a body that is dying? A taboo-breaking new documentary filmed inside a hospice on the Isle of Wight controversially features a seven-minute scene of the final moments of Alan Hardy, a retired north London bus depot manager. Island is directed by the artist and film-maker Steven Eastwood. It started life as an installation commissioned by the Fabrica Gallery in Brighton. Eastwood spent months at the Earl Mountbatten Hospice in Newport between and working with terminally ill patients, four of whom appear in the film . What so dramatic about the footage of Alan death is how undramatic it is. I don’t know what I was expecting, a deathbed scene like the movies, perhaps: Alan mustering a few profound last words to make sense of it all, or a glimmer in his eyes as life flashes before him. Instead, for seven minutes, Alan drawn-out breaths become further spread apart until they stop. Medicated to blankness, he goes gentle into the night – thanks to the unfailing dedication of the hospice team who’ve carefully managed his death over two days. I tell Eastwood I was expecting something more. He nods. Other people have said the same thing. “What interesting is there isn’t an image. You can’t see the dying. I think that fascinating, because to talk about how the film shows you the moment of death, I don’t know when that moment is. I’ve watched it over and over. I still find myself thinking: is he going to breathe again?” As it happens, when the end came for Alan, Eastwood was asleep – you can hear him snoring gently off camera. “I’d been filming continuously for hours, so the nurses put a little mattress on the floor. I laid down minutes before he died.” How did he feel when he woke up and realised Alan was gone? “Elated, I really did. I could clearly see that his death had been very cared for, supported and painless. His death had been as a good a death as you could ask for.” The camera stays switched on as the nurses wash Alan body and comb his hair; their tenderness and respect are deeply moving. Eastwood had just started volunteering at his local hospice in east London when he saw the gallery call-out for submissions on the subject of end of life. What interested him about filming in a hospice? “I realised that there weren’t a lot of films about end of life. I just thought: how strange that there are very poor descriptions of something as natural as death, that happening on every street. In the history of visual art, there so many depictions of deathbeds. Isn’t it interesting that it fallen out of the space of art?” He mentions two contemporary artists who’ve tackled death through their work, Sophie Calle and Bill Viola, who both filmed their mothers as they lay dying. But why are there so few films that look death squarely in the face? A quick search on Google for “films about death” throws up a random list that includes Bambi (fine if you’re seven); Flatliners, the hokey thriller about medical students messing about with defibrillators; and The Death of Stalin , Armando Iannucci Soviet-era satire (which, yes, opens with Joseph Stalin carking it, but no, doesn’t have much to say about mortality, unless you’re the feared dictator of a totalitarian state). You’ll find the web longest list of films about death on the website Urns Online, which promises everything from “light comedy to stark and depressing art films”. The fact is that serious dramas involving death tend to focus more on dispelling stigma around illnesses – Aids in Philadelphia, Alzheimer in Away from Her – than the dying process. You can picture a director pitching a mortality-themed script to financiers: “I’m thinking hospital ward. I’m think nursing home. Let show them what really happens when you die. Whaddya think?” Stony silence. So perhaps there will always be a gap between fiction and reality. But documentaries do push the limits of what can be shown on screen. In Allan King filmed five terminally ill patients in a hospice in Toronto for his vérité documentary Dying at Grace. During the Aids crisis, a number of films intimately chronicled men dying from the disease (Silverlake Life: The View from Here, Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt). Controversially, the film The Bridge showed the actual suicides of people leaping to their deaths from the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco. Director Eric Steel set up a camera to film the bridge for a year, then interviewed friends and families of the jumpers. The Bridge divided critics – ghoulish snuff film or poetic meditation on suicide? Werner Herzog is a director famed for staring death in the eyes and not blinking. Yet even he refused to play the audio of a real-life death in his documentary Grizzly Man , about the naturalist and film-maker Timothy Treadwell, who was killed by the bears he was observing in the wilderness of Alaska. Perhaps the most crass and deplorable example of death on screen came years ago in the cult shock-doc Faces of Death, which claimed to feature authentic footage of real-life deaths, human and animal. It turned out around of scenes were faked – including a man being eaten by an alligator. Why do we have this taboo of showing death on screen, I ask Eastwood. “This what interests me as a maker. We carry with us a lot of folk wisdom or rules about what we think is appropriate. And I think we sometimes don’t check in with ourselves about whether that has any bearing any more.” In the weeks before shooting Island, he experienced two bereavements himself: “My partner at the time mother – the grandmother of my children – and my closest friend died within weeks of each other. I was already in that mental space. So, I was able to say to people I was talking to about the film that I’d just had a bereavement. I wouldn’t have asked for it to be that way …” His voice trails off. Virtually all the terminally ill patients Eastwood approached on the Isle of Wight were interested in meeting him to talk about the film. “They were quite happy with a camera coming into their life at that time. I think the assumption is that it wouldn’t be wanted.” Alan used to joke that he was Eastwood Charlton Heston. “I think he really enjoyed leading-man status, and the attention.” Alan, it turns out, had strong beliefs about life after death. Earlier in the film, he tells the camera that he convinced the core of him will live on. He wants to see his wife again in the next life. “I’ve got plans. I’m going to take up ballroom dancing.” Does he think immortality – the chance to live on in some way on film – motivates his subjects, I ask Eastwood. “I don’t know. I didn’t really discuss legacy with them.” It was the nurses that he struggled to get in front of the camera. Five months into shooting, he called an emergency meeting at the hospice. “I showed them a rough cut of the film, and I said: ‘It looks as though nobody is receiving care in this building.’” Why does he think they were so reticent? “I think they’re trained to be selfless.” One of the things that struck him watching the nurses was how much time they spent on the non-medical stuff. “What happens if this person estranged father turns up? Their gay partner? All these people are brought together in one room, and the nurses have to manage all of those emotions while delivering medication. Hospices are a space of life. All the drama, all of the emotions, all of the joy. Everybody had a dread of them, but I think they’re some of the most progressive spaces in our society.” Eastwood believes that hospices should be more visible in the community to remove the stigma around terminal illness and dying – to make death more familiar, less frightening. He compares our squeamishness around death to how society used to view childbirth: “Fifty years ago there weren’t many photographs or films of births, but now that understood as a celebration of our bodies.” People have come up to him after screenings, telling him the film has made them less scared about dying. “There lots of research that shows that being better informed about what happens to our bodies when we are dying can alleviate anxiety.” If Alan death feels natural, the tragedy of the film belongs to Jamie Gunnell, a lorry driver and father of two. He was diagnosed with stage-four cancer after going to his doctor with a stomach ache. “It came out of nowhere for him,” says Eastwood. “Jamie went through a lot.” In the film you watch Jamie and a couple of his mates sitting in his room at the hospice watching football with a few cans of Guinness on the go. It oddly very moving to see these blokiest of blokes joking about cancer. “Fucking hell,” says one of them watching a nurse drain the contents of Jamie stomach into a bag. “Looks like chicken stock.” Island review – unblinking vigil at death door Eastwood says that Jamie and his mates were determined to “continue their relationship on normal terms”. And business as usual meant booze and banter. “Guinness cans and football, smoking a joint out the back, that how he wanted to die.” Still, the film most haunting images are of Jamie, his face stricken by fear and confusion – totally alone, as if he is already seeing the world from the outside. “He went through period of anger and desperation, but then would bounce back, and his humour was always there. That was his way of normalising it.” Eastwood says that nurses talk about something happening when a patient is very close to death – the temperature changing in the room. Has making the film changed how he feels about death and his own mortality? He shrugs. “I take a pretty stoical view on it. I don’t feel any great fear about it. I’m very aware that I’m an animal, a biological thing. Possibly, it has made me feel reassured.” “The chances are I’ll probably die in a similar way [to Alan], if I’m lucky enough to get to late life. Most of us will die of cancer or heart disease. Or dementia. And that will almost certainly involve some kind of end-of-life palliative care support. I don’t think you can overstate how extraordinary these people are. They’re just brilliant. I loved going back to that hospice, because I loved being around those people.” Island is released in the UK on September.",1853,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/13/island-documentary-steven-eastwood
33,"t easy to make fun of the actor Mark Wahlberg , so let do it. He was asked by a fan on Instagram to detail his workout routine, but he went a lot further than that, giving a detailed breakdown of his working (out) day. If we believe the schedule he posted (and I admit there is a tiny, cynical part of me that wonders whether this is all a publicity stunt), he gets up at and spends the day in carefully timed segments in the gym, snacking, showering and, of course, praying, before going to bed at There are quite a few peculiarities in his daily routine: he has a shower at that seems to last for an hour and a half; his round of golf takes just half an hour, compared with the usual four hours – maybe he is playing crazy golf; at he has an hour of cryotherapy, subjecting himself to blasts of ridiculously cold air – three minutes is the recommended limit or you get frostbite; and he has family time at when his four kids are at school (actually, that quite sensible). It a far cry from the daily routine of Hunter S Thompson, which, as the historian Alex von Tunzelmann reminds us , involved getting up at drinking epic quantities of whiskey and coffee, snorting cocaine, dropping acid and watching pornographic movies in the hours after midnight when he was supposed to be writing . Like Thompson (and here the comparison ends), Wahlberg does not say when he finds time for rehearsing, learning lines and all that other mundane stuff, but maybe his kind of movies don’t involve much dialogue. The buff body – he looking good at – is everything. That is at the core of his insane daily routine: the battle to preserve the gloriously honed body that made him famous as a Calvin Klein model in his Sadly, he is, in the end, destined to lose that battle, which is where his Catholicism will come in useful when the muscles start to fail. Absolution before abs. Actors who were beautiful in their have two options: fight to preserve your beauty – the Wahlberg way; or embrace the disintegration – let call it the Brando method (although maybe Marlon went a little too far). Our narcissistic culture has always preferred the former for women – hence all the diet fads and plastic surgery – and now that has spread to men, too, with actors such as Wahlberg taking the lead. The grotesque thing is that impressionable young people hooked on Love Island will take it seriously. No doubt soon everyone will want a cryo recovery chamber in their back garden. Some reporters have called Wahlberg schedule “ busy ” and “ jam-packed ”. But to me it suggests someone with a short attention span who doesn’t have enough to do – even successful actors tend to have a lot of time on their hands. It also calls to mind Donald Trump, with his obsessive tweeting and golfing (although with less gym time, obviously). Trump, like Wahlberg, needs to be weaned off narcissism and given something practical to do. Basket weaving, perhaps. Both might also benefit from having a lie-in occasionally.",539,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/sep/12/mark-wahlberg-extreme-daily-schedule-mega-workout-cryotherapy
34,"Some time in the late Federico Fellini is said to have taken the beautiful young Fenella Fielding out to dinner at Claridge in London and offered her a movie that he would direct, featuring her in half a dozen roles: a sensational showcase. But Fielding turned him down, on the grounds that she was booked for a theatrical season at Chichester. It may not have happened quite that way – Fielding had a mischievous way of exaggerating anecdotes for the benefit of saucer-eyed interviewers. But however serious or merely seductive Fellini movie idea (did he expansively improvise it over brandies?), the great director was undoubtedly impressed with Fielding acting talent. She was a brilliant interpreter of Wilde and Ibsen on stage and had written and performed one-woman revue shows at the time of the Peter Cook satire boom. Perhaps Fellini was also a little in love with her. What would have happened if Fielding had somehow broken her Chichester contract and done the Fellini film? Perhaps her career and public reputation would have gone another way, and she would have achieved a position in film to match the very real respect she had earned in the theatre. As things turned out, she was destined to be remembered for just one thing, and she good-humouredly accepted that: a sexy-campy-vampy cartoon persona. This was most obviously her slinky Valeria in Carry on Screaming in which she reclines languorously on a chaise-longue, asks Harry H Corbett uptight-but-tempted police inspector: “Do you mind if I smoke?” and starts to emit vapour from her whole body. “And I was trying to give up!” says Corbett, reaching eagerly into the fog. That deathless line became the title of her autobiography. Everyone agreed that Fenella Fielding was smoking hot. Fenella Fielding, Carry On Screaming actor, dies aged Many talented actors have their careers derailed by one distinctive thing about them, which goes from meal ticket to millstone. Fielding became the victim-beneficiary of that extraordinary voice: outrageously, hilariously velvety and kittenish. In her early movie career, doing light comedies such as the Doctor movies and a farce with Norman Wisdom (whom she detested), she just sounded posh, husky and sexy. If things had been different, she could have had Joanna Lumley career. But everyone could see how well the voice played on screen. Fielding prudently declined to do any more Carry Ons after that, seeing all too clearly how she would be imprisoned. But it defined her. In her film career, she was arguably the equivalent of Kenneth Williams, who played her brother in Carry on Screaming: the absurd undead scientist Dr Orlando Watt. He, too, was a very intelligent stage performer, great raconteur and chatshow turn with a richly resonant voice that he allowed to become a self-parody; he was tempted into the cul-de-sac of popular British cinema at a time when that appeared to offer regular work and the easy hit of popular fame. But it was a Faustian bargain. As for Fielding, she continued to work in television and the theatre, including some stints with Morecambe and Wise (unlike Gerald Thomas stingy Carry On film deals, TV work with Eric and Ernie would have earned her handsome payments for their endless repeats). She became something like a national treasure, and her theatre work is a cherished memory. It would have been interesting if someone had offered her a decent film role.",566,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/12/fenella-fielding-peter-bradshaw-appreciation
35,"Inimitable, luxuriantly breathy and slyly mellifluous, Fenella Fielding, who has died aged was a household name in the when she graced and sidled across the West End stage and the television screen, as well as appearing in the Carry On and Doctor films, usually playing a vamp, or the femme fatale, alongside actors such as Kenneth Williams , Sid James, Dirk Bogarde and James Robertson Justice. There was always something exotic and possibly louche about Fielding. You never felt that she had skimped on mascara, eyeshadow or lipstick, or that her hair was necessarily all her own in its chaotic and often strangely unkempt manifestation. At the same time, she might appear in public, and occasionally on television, on a chat show, or the popular word game Call My Bluff, dressed in clothes of a distinctly severe line, with white collars back and front, clasped with big jewellery, which gave her the appearance of an unlikely modern nun on the run. No one ever had such a laughing drawl, or haughtier, naughtier intonations. And then she would be spied scuttling around the stacks in the London Library, researching and reading, writing up her diary; as an intellectual, she was no slouch. She was as clever as she was funny, the emphatic articulation a sign of both the musical value she attached to words and the precise weight and emphasis of their meaning. A lot of gurgling and swooping went on, but years at the coal face of cabaret and intimate revue ensured that Fielding timing was never out, her meaning never insecure, her indecision always final. Her defining performance was that of Lady Parvula de Panzoust, an outrageous, high-fashion maneater, in Sandy Wilson Valmouth a brilliant musical version of Ronald Firbank orchidaceous novelette. When the piece was revived by the director John Dexter at the Chichester festival theatre in Fielding returned to the role, as did her fellow original cast members, Bertice Reading and Doris Hare , to theirs. By then, Fielding stage career was virtually over. Her utterly distinctive performance persona was both her chief calling card and her greatest handicap. The world of entertainment treasured a talent it found increasingly hard to accommodate. In she opened the restored Lyric Hammersmith studio space with a solo show (with piano trio) that included poems by WH Auden , Fran Landesman and AP Herbert, as well as Broadway songs and an erotic sketch during which you heard her orgasmic moanings offstage before she marched on smartly to shoot the lover boy dead. With her flounced auburn locks arrayed in startling bunches on either side of her face, and dressed in a chic rust trouser suit, she resembled a whacked-out Theda Bara with just enough juice to last the evening. She was gloriously funny and uncompromising. Later in her career, certainly as Madame Arcati, the eccentric medium, in Noël Coward Blithe Spirit at the Salisbury Playhouse in her magnificent weirdness was scuppered by a weakened technical assurance; nor could you imagine such a creature pedalling herself home for seven miles on a bicycle. Fielding Arcati would only have contemplated a sedan chair fitted out with an abundance of cushions and custards, borne by two well-built local lads with a penchant for show tunes. Fenella grew up in a mansion flat in Clapton, east London, with her parents, Philip and Tilly Feldman (both Jewish, he an immigrant Lithuanian, she originally Romanian), an elder brother, Basil (later Lord Feldman, a Tory peer), and a “sort of nanny person” who took Fenella to dance classes on the Holloway Road. Philip was a cinema manager and boss of a ladies underwear factory, a prominent freemason and, according to his daughter, abusively violent towards her. The family moved to Edgware in when Fenella was and a pupil at the North London collegiate school. She won a scholarship to Rada, but left after one year, pressured by her parents to “get a proper job”. She took a secretarial course while studying at Saint Martin School of Art (now Central Saint Martins ) and worked for the actors’ agent Al Parker, and in a beautician parlour. But she was determined to go on the stage. After a grounding in concert halls and club theatres around London, she left home, took a flat in Clarges Street, Mayfair, which she shared with a prostitute, and started making cameo appearances on the night club scene of the at Churchill in Bond Street, the Don Juan in Brook Street and in the Washington Mayfair hotel. She was talent-spotted while appearing at the London School of Economics in a revue written by Ron Moody , and this led to her first West End professional engagement, in a revue, Cockles and Champagne, at the Saville. So she was a comparatively late starter, but she made up for lost time as an exotic vamp, Luba Tradjejka, in Jubilee Girl at the Victoria Palace. She was acquiring a following, and the producer Michael Codron cast her first in Valmouth and then in a revue, Pieces of Eight at the Apollo co-starring Williams – with whom she soon fell out, noting that he wanted her to be good, but not too good – which featured sketches written by Peter Cook and Harold Pinter . Her earliest films included Doctor in Distress with Bogarde at his smoothest and sprightliest as Simon Sparrow, and Ken Hughes Drop Dead Darling in which, as a wealthy object of Tony Curtis attentions, she was treated to a ride out in the country, where she jumped over a hedge Curtis had artfully placed on the edge of a cliff. Fielding played Valeria the vampire in Carry on Screaming a very funny spoof of the Hammer horror films, in which she curled up on a sofa and exhaled the line, “Do you mind if I smoke?” after which vapour billowed out from beneath her body; the phrase served as the title of her chatty autobiography, written with Simon McKay. She could be perfect in Feydeau farces, and was just that in Sardou Let Get a Divorce at the Mermaid in and as the aptly named Lady Eager in another Mermaid classic, Lock Up Your Daughters an updated musical version by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall , with music by Laurie Johnson , of both Henry Fielding Rape Upon Rape and Vanbrugh The Relapse, with Christopher Plummer as Lord Foppington leading a cast including Georgia Brown, Glynis Johns and Roy Kinnear. The Chichester festival theatre was another regular haunt; she was Mrs Sullen in The Beaux’ Stratagem there in and an imperious duchess in Look After Lulu, adapted by Coward from Feydeau, in Even Ibsen held no fear for her, and there were glowing reports of her Hedda Gabler in Leicester in and her Nora in A Doll House at the Gardner Centre in Brighton in She moved in into a top-floor flat in Connaught Mews, near Marble Arch, which cost her just a week. She had a knack for landing on her feet in her personal life that perhaps evaded her professionally later on. She did not marry, but said that for years she kept two lovers on the go, one of them married, without either knowing of the other existence, as befits a Feydeau specialist. In her memoir she described the men who had behaved badly in the workplace: Tony Hancock was “drunk”, Warren Mitchell simply “horrible” and Norman Wisdom (with whom she filmed Follow a Star in prone to on-set lechery: “His hand up your skirt first thing in the morning was not a lovely way to start a day filming,” she said. Critics loved her and hated most of the things she was in. When she played Kaa the rock snake in The Jungle Book at the Adelphi in she wrapped herself around a pole in a manner that reminded Michael Billington of Hermione Gingold in a Medea parody clinging to a phallic pillar with a cry of “This is my personal column!”, while another scribe said of her Lady Fidget in a vile production of The Country Wife at the Mermaid in that she “pouts like a tulip in a field of potatoes”. Fielding continued working past her birthday, making radio programmes, recording poetry and voiceovers and rarely going anywhere without her spider-like eyelashes, eyelashes Dusty Springfield once acknowledged as the model for her own. She was not immune to the appeal of drink, drugs and psychotherapy, but survived all these brushes to come out fighting, and as huskily cheerful and optimistic as ever. She was appointed OBE in the Queen birthday honours in June. She is survived by her brother.

36,"The former Carry On actor, Fenella Fielding , has died aged her spokeswoman has said. The star, who enjoyed a showbusiness career spanning seven decades, suffered a stroke two weeks ago and died on Tuesday. She appeared in two Carry On films – Carry On Regardless in and Carry On Screaming! in – and was awarded an OBE in the Queen birthday honours list. Carry on Screaming Fenella Fielding on fighting with Kenneth Williams and bouncing back after bankruptcy “We are very sad to announce that Fenella Fielding OBE passed away this afternoon on Tuesday September,” her spokeswoman said. “This follows a severe stroke two weeks ago. During that time, she has been very comfortable and always looked tranquil and divine. And always wearing her eyelashes. “Miss Fielding was an incredible talent. That voice! A unique woman, much loved by family, friends and fans. She will be missed tremendously.” According to Fielding website, her career began in when she starred on stage in The Constant Lover. Her television roles included parts in The Avengers, The Prisoner and The Morecambe and Wise Show. She also boasted stage credits in plays by Shakespeare and Henry James. But it is her role alongside Kenneth Williams as Valeria in Carry On Screaming! for which she is best known. The popular film parodied Hammer Horror movies and her memoir Do You Mind If I Smoke? is named after one of its best-known jokes. Fenella Fielding – a life in pictures She recounted falling out with Williams while they worked on the comedy revue Pieces of Eight together after a newspaper article praised her. “Kenneth came out of the wings and he had the paper in his hand and he had the most terrible temper about it. I thought, God, I can’t help the fact they’ve said something nice about me.” While she had success, she felt typecast. Speaking to the Guardian last year about the public perception of her, she said: “There are always people who don’t think you should be able to climb out of your cave.” She said that she felt she was not offered more serious roles because “you’ve got to show you’re not just a lark”. While her performance as Hedda Gabler was lauded, she felt that not enough people saw it. “Then you’ve got to get people to let you do one after another after another, before it obliterates the comedy you’ve done,” she added. In her book, she accused the comic actor, Norman Wisdom, of “always making a pass – hand up your skirt first thing in the morning”. Looking back on that period last December, in the light of the #MeToo movement , she said: “There was a time when every man I met … it was really something horrid” Fielding was born in London to a Lithuanian father and a Romanian mother. She is the younger sister of Basil Feldman, Baron Feldman, a former Conservative member of the House of Lords.",494,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/11/fenella-fielding-carry-on-actor-dies-aged-90
37,"Early in the glossy new Oscar-bait film The Theory of Everything , Eddie Redmayne Stephen Hawking takes Felicity Jones Jane Wilde on a first date to his parents’ house. The invitation seems a whim, the Hawking family happy and full of in-jokes, like something out of a Salinger novel. Hawking shyly asks Jones to the May ball at Cambridge. And there he remarks on the phosphorescence of clothing detergent, initially refuses to dance, then concedes finally to a slow waltz and a kiss, on a beautifully lit bridge outdoors. This is all very romantic. It also mostly never happened. There was a May ball, a conversation about Tide, and a little dancing. But the lunch is fiction and in fact, so is the bridge, the kiss and the manner of the invitation. The Theory of Everything marketing materials will tell you it is based on Jane Hawking memoir of her marriage, a book published in the UK as Music to Move the Stars and then reissued as Travelling to Infinity . But the screenwriter gone and rearranged the facts to suit certain dramatic conventions. And while that always happens in these based-on-a-true-story films, the scale of the departure in The Theory of Everything is unusually wide. The film becomes almost dishonest – in a way that feels unfair to both parties, and oddly, particularly Jane Hawking herself. That invitation, for example: in the film it is presented as a joyous occasion before the diagnosis. Yet Jane Hawking records it actually coming over the telephone, and in fact by that time she already knew Stephen had a degenerative motor neuron disease. And their arrival at the ball happens by way of a terrifying car ride, because apparently Hawking was an incautious driver, with a lead foot on the pedal and a mind elsewhere. Jane remarks, “He probably felt that he could afford to live dangerously since fate had already dealt him such a cruel blow.” In fact she frightened enough to not want to drive home with him, although she enjoys herself well enough. In another of the film pivotal scenes, one replicated in the trailers as a sort of thesis statement for the character, Jones Jane says to Stephen father, “I know what you all think, that I do not seem like a very strong person. But we are going to fight this disease together.” If that sounds a little pat to you, it does to me too. This scene never appears in the memoir, and in fact Jane Hawking says she never got any comments from her friends or family at all. She describes the first year after the engagement as filled with “euphoria”. The memoir, in short, reveals a much more complex courtship than the film captures, and a newlywed bliss much less self-conscious about the weight it would come to assume. While obviously no film could precisely replicate the inside experience of a marriage, it feels like the film-makers didn’t even try. They simply made up another. This is a shame because the memoir shows you that there was much deeper dramatic intrigue here. Women of Jane Hawking generation and type are a puzzle to my own. They seem so content to abandon personal ambition in pop culture representations like The Theory of Everything . And I cringed while reading that when Stephen proposed, Jane writes, she “consigned all my thoughts of a career in the diplomatic service to oblivion”. And that is more or less where the film leaves the balance of power between Stephen and Jane careers. But as I read on I learned that Jane continued to teach French and Spanish. And she minded when Hawking would belittle her work, a belief he apparently even articulated to the man who supervised her undergraduate thesis. She observed of other physicists’ wives that “they were already, to all intents and purposes, widows – physics widows.” While not precisely a feminist, she writes that she knew early on that just being a wife and mother was “a one-way ticket to outer darkness, and that it was essential to preserve my own identity”. The movie gestures towards Jane own intellectual ambitions but mostly collapses her individualist spirit into her love of Jonathan Hellyer Jones, a choir director who became involved with the family. (He and Jane Hawking are now married, though it not clear their love affair came about as summarily as it is presented in the film either.) It a confusing choice because it seems to miss the truly intriguing bit of the marriage: preserving yourself in the face of marriage vows. Women still feel the tug of a nurturing ideal that on the surface Jane Hawking represents. She took on this genius husband, who came with a sort of “you’ll live in his shadow” guarantee. He also had a degenerative disease and his care stretched out decades longer than expected. But instead of exploring that fascinating texture in a marriage, The Theory of Everything is hell-bent on preserving the cliche: it tells you that Jane Hawking quietly and gratefully parted ways with him when it became clear their affection for each other was a casualty of the strain. The movie presents the demise of their relationship as a beautiful, tear-soaked, mutually respectful conversation. Of course that didn’t actually happen either. Jane book describes a protracted breakup that comes to a head in a screaming fight on vacation. She also described devastation when Hawking announced by letter he was leaving her for his second wife, Elaine Mason. He ended up married to Mason for years before that fell apart and then he and Jane mended fences. Which, as it happens, the movie fudges too. It tries to present the rapprochement as coming when Hawking was made a Companion of Honour in but that actually happened before the couple separated. I suppose the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten , thought he was making the most of such a dramatic occasion. But I wish he’d stopped and imagined, just for a second, what it might be like to be facing Her Majesty with years’ worth of much more complicated emotions roiling inside you.",1022,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/14/theory-of-everything-movie-jane-steven-hawking-memoir
38,"ith this year major festivals now out of the way, awards prognosticators have a clearer, if still incomplete, idea of the films we will all be talking about from now to the end of February. By this time last year, we had already seen seven of the nine nominees for best picture and as the frantic pace of Telluride, Venice and Toronto fades, it time to look back on the buzz that become most deafening. The 'popular Oscar' U-turn is embarrassing. But it better than the alternative While using the term frontrunner might be a tad presumptuous at this stage, it appears as if there are two films that have garnered the warmest notices thus far and both premiered during this year Venice film festival. The first is Roma , the intimate new drama from Alfonso Cuarón, that looking like Netflix first best picture contender, a major milestone for the streaming platform given their increase in alliances with world-class auteurs. They’re thirsty for it too, with a splashy campaign under way and reports that the film could be their first to receive an exclusive cinematic release before it heads online. Reviews have been almost universally enthusiastic, with the Guardian Peter Bradshaw awarding it five stars, calling it Cuarón “best film so far”. But is the often musty academy ready to introduce Netflix to the big league and will the fact that it in Spanish restrict its chances to the foreign language film category? A far more Oscar-ready proposition is Bradley Cooper take on the music-driven romance A Star is Born , which scored a roaring reception in Venice and continued the hype through to Toronto. It a wildly popular crowd-pleaser with Cooper name mentioned in both lead actor and director categories but the performance that been talked about the most is that of Lady Gaga who has pretty much already won the best actress in a musical or comedy category at the Golden Globes but is set to compete in the best actress Oscar race as well. Her competition will probably include Olivia Colman who impressed Venice and Telluride audiences with her performance as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos darkly comic romp The Favourite which could also see either previous winners Emma Stone or Rachel Weisz in the best supporting actress category. One performance that quietly made a mark at Toronto last year, Glenn Close in the literary drama The Wife , was finally given a theatrical release over the summer and the six-time nominee could score another nod come January. Audiences at Telluride and Toronto also gravitated towards Melissa McCarthy turn in Can You Ever Forgive Me? , the tragic-comic true story of author Lee Israel who became a master of forgery. She likely to pick up a best actress nomination while Richard E Grant, who plays her unlikely drinking buddy, is heading for a best supporting actor nod. The film landed better than The Front Runner , another true story also premiering at the Colorado-based festival, the tale of disgraced senator Gary Hart. The Jason Reitman-directed drama, starring Hugh Jackman in the lead, received mixed reviews and by the time it screened in Toronto, buzz was quiet, although in a muted year for best actor, don’t count Jackman out just yet. There was a similar fate at Telluride for Joel Edgerton much-anticipated gay conversion drama Boy Erased which, despite a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe and Lucas Hedges, was met with politeness rather than passion and is unlikely to make an impression in this year race. The same festival also saw two Oscar winners reveal two very different movies. Robert Redford looks like a sure thing, playing a stick-up artist in Old Man and the Gun , especially given his decision to retire, while Nicole Kidman turn as an amoral detective in Destroyer will probably be too dark for the academy, with the film also receiving mixed reviews. On paper, critics weren’t sure what to expect from Steve McQueen Widows , a remake of an ITV Lynda La Plante series that marked a giant commercial leap into the multiplex for the director of Years a Slave and Shame. But his ruthlessly entertaining star-studded thriller proved to be one of the most popular films in Toronto, garnering strong reviews with captivated audience reactions suggesting it will be a big hit on release. But is it too much of a genre offering to impress the academy? It certainly deserves inclusion and if they do go big for it then Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debicki and a fantastically sinister turn from Daniel Kaluuya could also figure in the race. The circuit also brought new films from Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins, two directors who dominated the Oscars back in (Chazelle picked up best director for La La Land while Jenkins scored a shock best picture victory with Moonlight). The former picked the story of the moon landing in the large-scale drama First Man , re-teaming with Ryan Gosling who took on the role of Neil Armstrong. Reviews were strong, with a few misgivings, suggesting that both the film and Gosling could factor into the conversation. Jenkins’ adaptation of James Baldwin If Beale Street Could Talk might have been bigger-budgeted than his breakout but it was far from a step into commercialism, its lyrical, slow-paced ode to the power of love unlikely to please everyone. But it was met with deservingly strong reviews from critics and is close to a sure thing for academy and guild voters, its beautiful artistry likely to be recognised in a number of categories (everything from production design to costumes) with Emmy-loved Regina King also seeming like a strong possibility for best supporting actress for her performance as a strong-willed mother. One of the season biggest surprises came near the end of Toronto with the premiere of Green Book , a charming crowd-pleaser from Peter Farrelly that could be this year dark horse. It a broad look at racial tensions in the with a warm heart and will likely continue to play like gangbusters until its smartly timed Thanksgiving release. Expect it to show up in a number of categories, including acting recognition for Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. It also pulled off a shock victory, winning the people choice award in Toronto. Many had expected it to go to A Star is Born (with help from some little monsters) but Green Book was voted the most popular film with audiences and given that in previous years, the title has gone to Years a Slave, The King Speech and Slumdog Millionaire, it a strong sign of things to come. The furore over the now-axed popular movie category was largely populated by pundits viewing it as a patronising way to ensure that Black Panther received some academy love but the film phenomenal year could see it become the first superhero adventure to receive a best picture nomination anyway. Acting-wise, Michael B Jordan show-stopping turn as Killmonger might see him receive a deserved best supporting actor nod too. If nominated, he could face Timothée Chalamet whose haunting performance as a meth addict in the grim drama Beautiful Boy received universal acclaim in Toronto even if the film itself was met with a mixed response. In Ben is Back , another film about addiction that premiered at the festival, Julia Roberts earned praise for playing a struggling mother and given her academy history, she could also gain a nod. There are still some major films to debut, however, and ones that could have a huge impact on the race. The biggest of these is Vice from Adam McKay, following up The Big Short with a dramatisation of the life of Dick Cheney, played by Christian Bale, with Amy Adams taking on his wife. With a cast that also includes Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, Sam Rockwell as George Bush, Bill Pullman as Nelson Rockefeller and Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, expect it to be a contender. There could also be love for Mary Poppins Returns , a film Disney has so much faith in that it reportedly led to them releasing their annual Star Wars offering in the summer just to avoid a clash. Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Colin Firth star. Netflix also has Susanne Bier post-apocalyptic thriller Bird Box which could be big for star Sandra Bullock while both the actress and best supporting actress races could see nods for Mary Queen of Scots , starring Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie. Finally, Fox hopes to rise above the negative on-set drama for Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody which could launch Rami Malek into the best actor competition. Ten safe nominee bets Lady Gaga – best actress, A Star is Born Alfonso Cuarón – best director, Roma Richard E Grant – best supporting actor, Can You Ever Forgive Me? Olivia Colman – best actress, The Favourite Regina King – best supporting actress, If Beale Street Could Talk Robert Redford – best actor, Old Man and the Gun Timothée Chalamet – best supporting actor, Beautiful Boy Barry Jenkins – best director, If Beale Street Could Talk Bradley Cooper – best actor, A Star is Born Glenn Close – best actress, The Wife",1534,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/17/oscars-2019-who-are-this-years-early-front-runners

Skyscraper review – The Rock towers over an inferno of cliches At the same time, it tells you Johnson is a regular, relatable family guy. An earlier Instagram image showed him kneeling and feeding his wife pasta while she breastfed their baby daughter: “So much respect to her and all mamas out there holding it down and running things.” (He has two daughters, aged two and two months, with his second wife, Lauren Hashian, plus a daughter from his first marriage.) Even Johnson breakfast covers all the bases: steak for breakfast = red-blooded alpha bro! Fruit and wholegrains = healthy and responsible! And in classic Johnson style, it washed down with freshly squeezed self-deprecation, just in case anyone hates him for being such a #PerfectHusband/Father/Star. But no one does hate Dwayne Johnson, do they? Is such a thing even possible? You suspect if there was one person on the planet who expressed mild dislike towards him, Johnson would go round to their house and make them a stack of pancakes, or simply send them gifs of him raising his world-famous right eyebrow until they succumbed. Every era has had its reigning movie star, and Johnson is undoubtedly ours. He bestrides the box office like a meat-sculpted colossus. He topped Forbes list of highest-paid actors in (earning and he probably will again for considering he on his third blockbuster this year and we’ve barely even hit summer. highest earner was Mark Wahlberg, but he only got a measly million Instagram followers). Johnson Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, released last December, made nearly a billion dollars globally. His monster movie Rampage, released this April, took more than There some theoretical scenario in which his new action thriller Skyscraper could be a flop but, at this stage in Johnson career, you can’t see it happening. He just too popular. However, Johnson ascent comes at a time when the very concept of movie stars is under serious renegotiation. In blockbuster-skewed modern Hollywood franchises rule, not actors. You can cast one of a number of fresh-faced young dudes in Spider-Man, for example, and people will still flock to see it because it a Spider-Man movie. Likewise any other comic-book movie, Star Wars movie, Jurassic Park movie, whatever. Johnson, too, benefited from his affiliation with the Fast and Furious crew, and over the course of his four appearances, he has performed such heroic feats as bringing down a drone by driving an ambulance into it and diverting a torpedo with his bare hands. But how many movie stars can get a hit without a franchise? Tom Cruise? His Mission: Impossible movies are still huge, but when he tries to launch something new, such as last year Mummy reboot, it falls flat. As have many other star-led efforts, such as Jennifer Lawrence Red Sparrow, Scarlett Johansson Ghost in the Shell or pretty much anything Robert Downey Jr does where he not Iron Man. Not to mention Fast and Furious erstwhile leader Vin Diesel, whose only other notable contribution to the culture has arguably been I Am Groot. But Johnson is different. Johnson can open a big movie by himself. Rampage was a case in point: a middling effects movie based on an old video game, it didn’t have brand recognition or a star-packed cast. All it had, and all it needed, was Johnson. Same with Skyscraper: there only his name above the title. Now everything Johnson makes looks like the beginning of a franchise (well, maybe not Baywatch). That a movie star. “People want to see him right now,” says Steven Gaydos, executive editor of Variety and seasoned Hollywood star-watcher. “I’m delighted Johnson is doing so well because he proof that people still go to the movies to see someone they identify with, someone they like, they admire, they find thrilling, funny, heroic, engaging. Clearly this guy has it. You can’t fake this.” The ready comparison, Gaydos suggests, is Arnold Schwarzenegger . Like Schwarzenegger, Johnson ticket into the movies was his physique, which had already brought him celebrity on the wrestling circuit, and whose very buffness attested to a certain go-getting self-discipline. But also like Schwarzenegger, Johnson surprised people once he got on to the screen. “He shrewdly understood that being typecast as this big action guy who knocks people down and runs through burning buildings and stuff is not the way to run a career,” says Gaydos. “And his comedic chops are tremendous, as Arnold were. It like he saying: ‘You think I’m a bonehead from the world of wrestling and I’m going to prove you wrong. And every time I prove you wrong, my stock-in-trade is going to go up.’” Johnson also has commonalities with another latter-day box-office king: Will Smith . In the early Smith sat down with his manager and worked out what type of movies he needed to make in order to become the biggest star in the world. They came up with a very basic formula: special effects, creatures, a love story. And it worked. You could imagine Team Johnson making a similar set of calculations. After an inauspicious debut as a bad CGI monster in The Mummy Returns, he tried a number of avenues: sword-and-sandals fantasy (The Scorpion King, Hercules), family movies (Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy), edgy bit parts (Southland Tales, Be Cool). He learned from his mistakes, kept on working, and honed his distinct persona. If you had to break it down, Johnson “formula” would include: special effects, family to protect, superhuman physical feats to perform, heavy machinery to operate, cool head in a crisis. Pretty much his Instagram persona. Social media is one way that Johnson celebrity differs from that of his action-hero predecessors. Another, so obvious it barely remarked upon, is the fact that Johnson is not white. Nor is he conspicuously black. Few people know or care what he actually is. Technically, Johnson father is black Canadian and his mother is of Samoan descent, which puts him into a category that makes up less than of Americans. He was born in California, grew up in Hawaii. But Johnson could easily pass for anything from Latino to Native American to Mediterranean to Pacific Islander to simply Very Tanned White Guy. He a multicultural everyman. In today global movie marketplace, that a great asset. “For the most part, his success is because he a really charming, friendly, authentic guy but that persona resonates with people because we can all claim him,” says Myra Washington, associate professor at the University of New Mexico. “Everyone is like: ‘The Rock is just like us’; or ‘He like my cousin’ or whatever. That just increases the buy-in.” Washington speciality is racially mixed people and cultures, especially “Blasians” (as in Black + Asian) such as Johnson. She notes how he plays up the diverse aspects of his heritage to appeal to different audiences. He talks about his tribal “pe’a” chest-and-arm tattoo, invoking his Samoan ancestry and his “warrior spirit”. He often uses the Hawaiian “mahalo” to hail people on social media. For the benefit of black fans, he’ll Instagram old photos of his father (who was also a pro wrestler – part of a duo called the Soul Patrol) or himself as a boy, back when he had more conspicuously afro hair. Johnson is also very much American and a patriot. He has relatives in the military and has organised fundraising concerts for the troops. “I don’t know if it transcending race; maybe weaponising race?” says Washington. “He like: ‘Here are all the things I’m going to do to force you to reconceptualise what blackness looks like, or what it means to be a Pacific Islander. Here are all of these things that I am and so in order to like me, you’re going to at least have to recognise these things, even if it on a superficial level.’” Now he got the whole world in his hands, what next? Johnson has enough to keep him in those “highest paid” lists for the next few years. Jumanji next year. A Fast and Furious spin-off, led by Johnson and Jason Statham, is also in the works (Johnson and Diesel famously didn’t get along during last year Fate of the Furious). He doing a movie based on Disney Jungle Cruise ride, an action-comedy with Gal Gadot (Red Notice), a family wrestling movie directed by Stephen Merchant, and is set to enter the DC Comics universe as antihero Black Adam. After that, he’ll be pushing and doubtless weighing up his career options. They tend to be limited for ex-movie titans. It difficult to see Johnson taking up directing or moving into serious drama like, say, Clint Eastwood. He is too level-headed to spin out into megalomaniac excess or religious mania, like Tom Cruise. Given his career to date, he more likely to retire from movies undefeated than accept a slow decline into irrelevance. The signs all point towards politics. When he was asked recently if he might one day run for president, he dismissed reports that he might stand in but told Variety : “I have so much respect for the position. It something that I seriously considered. What I need is time to go out and learn.” During the elections, both Republicans and Democrats sought Johnson endorsement. He turned them both down and says he did not vote. Hosting Saturday Night Live shortly after, Johnson joked: “In the past, I never would’ve considered running for president. I didn’t think I was qualified at all, but now I’m actually worried that I’m too qualified.” Pundits agreed Johnson could really win an election, even though nobody knows what his politics are. Being the biggest movie star in the world also comes with its job requirements, such as being studiously apolitical and taking no extreme position on anything that likely to alienate some crucial demographic. Is it possible to be all things to all people? By standing for everything, does Johnson actually stand for nothing? He has taken positions on some issues. He opposed Trump Muslim ban. He supported the anti-gun violence March for Our Lives protests, and the NFL players who knelt during the national anthem. He has declared himself a feminist. Then again, he was once a registered Republican, has Republican friends, and is capable of making a movie such as Walking Tall, in which he plays a soldier who returns from combat to find his home town starved of jobs and overrun with crime, and sets about singlehandedly Making America Great Again with a piece of two-by-four. Maybe Johnson is already bigger than politics. When he posts an Instagram of himself feeding his wife as she breastfeeds, he already changing the world. It not in Johnson nature to take sides, but maybe that is taking a side. In an ever-polarising political landscape that seems to be heading towards disaster-movie scenarios, Johnson is on the side of inclusion, compromise, diversity, plurality, being nice to absolutely everyone. He on the side of the centre. Maybe he actually is the centre: the last action hero, rock-solid nucleus of popular culture, whose flexing biceps are all that holding civilisation – or at least Hollywood – together.

41,"Sam Elliott has always been very careful about choosing roles. The a California-born performer with a celebrated drawl, has never made movies that served purely to further his career. His career has included roles in Road House, The Big Lebowski, Tombstone and, more recently, I’ll See You in My Dreams, but he never quite become the household name he should be. Sam Elliott on working with Lily Tomlin: 'We went through this catharsis' He experiencing something of a renaissance, though, with roles in two Netflix sitcoms (The Ranch and Grace and Frankie), a forthcoming part in Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga-starring remake of A Star is Born and a lead as an over-the-hill actor in the romantic drama The Hero. At the beginning of The Hero, you do voiceover work for a commercial. You’ve done ads for stuff like beef and Coors Banquet. You say “beef fajitas” with an extraordinary inflection in the ad where you list all the meals you can make with beef. How do you keep yourself emotionally engaged with material like that? [laughs] I did beef ads for about eight years because I love the people in that industry, and there are a lot of people who make their living in the beef world. Ranchers, primarily. Those ads pushed the numbers in the marketplace for beef up considerably ... but when it got to the point where they kept asking for different takes, different cuts, different deals you can get involved with ... I started to bristle at it, just talking to these guys. I think I talked myself out of a job, ultimately. Because it became something that I didn’t want to deal with every time out. Artists draw on so many previous experiences that people cannot know about when they watch their work. Is there a line that actors cross when they use their loved ones for their work? Or is it all just part of the process? I think the people that most often cross a line are comedians. I think they relish that, and take pride in that on some level – at least, from what little I’ve seen and understand about people that do stand-up. They’re really the most outlandish of all of us in the entertainment world. I guess the people who are the most off-putting on one level can also be the most entertaining as well. What kind of conversations do you have with your agent to ensure that you’re doing worthwhile work without sacrificing more commercial opportunities that might later give you enough security to do the kind of work you most want to do? My security comes from the fact that I’ve never done a job for money. A certain level of security comes out of the commercial world – that allows me to turn down the dramatic stuff, or the theatrical stuff ... the acting work. But I’ve always basically made my own decisions. And I think I’ve done reasonably well. I have people that I get feedback from, get opinions from, keep me on the track, so to speak. But to me, it all about what on the page. It not about working for money. It just something I’ve wanted to do since I was a little kid. How do you think the changes that are being made to the way people see movies is changing not just the roles you get offered, but the industry you work in? The game has totally changed. Changes that have been made in the technological world have revolutionized the movie business on almost every level. There are some constants that are never going to change. But from a technical standpoint, it a whole other world. Are there more opportunities to do movies to make movies like The Hero? I think there are, because there are more platforms to play this stuff on. Your voice must make it hard not to be typecast. What have been the biggest challenges that you’ve had to face in your career given people expectations of who you are based on how you sound? I don’t think I’ve ever had problems with my voice in terms of what people have wanted out of me as an actor. But I did do a movie called Lifeguard back in with a director named Dan Petrie, who did a lot of incredible work. Every once in a while, he would tell me: “Let do it again, and this time, let be a little less south in the mouth.” That always amused me. You’ve said in earlier interviews that you like westerns, and especially liked John Wayne films when you grew up. Which westerns have been your favorites? The Searchers would be up there. Red River. Shane. There was a particular time in Hollywood where the western was the bread and butter for everybody in town. In the early days, there was a bunch of really good western actors that were all you needed to make a good western. There were horses all around town. And wagons. And now all that stuff has moved on. Most of that stuff can only be found today in Texas, or New Mexico. It just a whole industry that disappeared. There a simplicity to that form that has always spoken to me. There a pretty well-defined morality to the characters: the good, the bad ... not a lot of gray area. It either one or the other in the stuff that spoken to me. Is there a movie you’ve starred in that you wished more people knew you for? No. I’ve done films over the years that basically no one saw. And I’m thankful that some of them haven’t been seen. But I’ve been fortunate in that I’ve been in a lot of films that a lot of people saw. It not about legacy for me. It about the people I’m working with at the time, and just going in and enjoying the process. It hard work, but it a creative, artistic process. And if you can’t enjoy that, then you’re going about it wrong. The Quad cinema in New York is showing a retrospective, Sam Elliott x from to June.

42,"Two highlights of Danny Boyle celebrated London Olympics opening ceremony were undoubtedly the Queen parachuting in with James Bond and the surprise cameo by Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean, as “first synthesizer” in the London Symphony Orchestra rendition of Chariots of Fire. Little did we realise at the time what a torch-passing moment this was. Six years on, look at where we are. The Bond brand is in crisis. Daniel Craig was only just persuaded to return (with a skipful of cash) but Danny Boyle has walked from directing the latest instalment, and some are wondering whether the franchise shouldn’t just call it a day. Meanwhile, with exquisite timing, along comes a third outing for Atkinson own spoof spy in Johnny English Strikes Again. The question is: which one better represents modern Britain? Most Brits would prefer to think of themselves as Bond: dashing, sophisticated, cool in a crisis, seducing all before them and subduing their foes. But to the rest of the world, they are far closer to English: inept, bumbling, xenophobic, and likely to make any situation worse. In Johnny English Strikes Again, Atkinson launches missiles at French cyclists, burns down a French restaurant, and stumbles around blindly assaulting innocent Londoners (in a virtual reality test gone wrong), while Emma Thompson tells him: “The country is in a state of complete chaos.” Even if you are trying your hardest not to read any of this in the context of Brexit (there, I said it), the rest of the world will not be so generous. Between English and his other Anglo caricature, Mr Bean, Atkinson is as big a brand as Bond globally. Mr Bean is so huge in China that Atkinson reprised the character last year for a local movie the rest of the world never saw. The animated series is broadcast in countries. Bean is part of the culture. Via an interactive mobile game, he the face of tourist promotions for post-Brexit London and he the figure every vaguely weak politician is compared to: Ed Miliband, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, even Theresa May (“the Mrs Bean of British politics” - the Sun). Atkinson himself waded into political waters last month, defending Boris Johnson joke about burqa-wearers resembling letterboxes as “pretty good” (to be fair, he was more interested in free speech than fanning Islamophobia – we hope). According to Atkinson, who now Mr Bean has officially retired. Strikes Again will likely be the comic last turn as Johnny English, too. But while the press is perennially speculating which actor should be the next Bond, perhaps the more important question is: who should be the next Johnny English? Daniel Craig ? Idris Elba? Michael Gove?

43,"hen Marina Zenovich was an aspiring actor living in New York, taking on small roles to pay the bills, she was cast as an extra in The Fisher King, appearing in the scene where Parry, the madcap eccentric played by Robin Williams , imagines a spontaneous flashmob breaking out among enchanted commuters in Grand Central Station. Robin Williams widow reveals how dying actor fought 'chemical warfare in his brain' It “one of the most glorious cinematic moments”, Zenovich says, but she’d forgotten taking part in it until her new documentary, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind, screened at the Karlovy Vary film festival this month. When asked if she ever had a chance to meet her subject, whose life she’d been poring over for four years, she recalled having waltzed in his close proximity. Fashioned from archival footage, old audio tapes, interviews with Williams’ contemporaries and clips of the comic stand-up, Come Inside My Mind is the first documentary to comprehensively examine Williams’ life and art since his suicide in It includes virtually no narration, save for Williams’ own, which can have an eerie, almost ghostlike effect (if only ghosts were as charming and exuberant as Robin Williams). “Every person is driven by some deep, deep, deep, deep secret,” he says in voiceover about halfway through the film. Steve Martin says when Robin was on stage, he was in charge. But in his life he was trying to hold himself together It a question Williams scarcely addressed, preferring to bare his soul by way of performance. “Steve Martin says in the film, when Robin was on stage, whether it was theater or standup, he was in charge,” says Zenovich. “But in his life he was trying to hold himself together.” Still, the comic embattled sense of sense worth threatened to impose itself on an otherwise supremely confident stage persona. As he says in voiceover, recalling advice from a shrink: “Be careful what you talk about, because you may be on stage in front of so many people and start talking about something you’re not able to deal with.” Martin, who starred opposite Williams in Mike Nichols’ stage production of Waiting for Godot, is one of several comedy heavyweights who appear in the film, which functions as both a showcase for Williams’ gifts and something of a shiva for the friends and family he left behind. Billy Crystal remembers the zany voicemails Robin left him; David Letterman waxes poetic about southern California in the when the governor, Jerry Brown, dated Linda Ronstadt; Pam Dawber shares stories from a lifelong friendship with Williams that began with Mork &amp; Mindy; and the actor own son, Zak, is wistful when calling to mind the years his father was absent. The film takes its name from one of Williams’ early standup routines, a motormouthed bit where he pantomimes removing the crown of his head and invites the audience to witness what inside. The magic of Williams’ comedy, often frenzied and off-the-cuff, was harder to capture in a documentary than that of Richard Pryor, Zenovich last subject . “With Richard Pryor, it was easier to settle because he told longer stories,” says the director. “I didn’t know what it would be like with Robin because his comedy is all over the place. What was hard was finding the mix of sadness and joy that the film now has. It looks easy, but it was a struggle.” With documentaries about Williams, Pryor and Roman Polanski under her belt, Zenovich has somewhat unwittingly developed a reputation for appraising the lives of “difficult” men. “My husband pointed out to me that I do that, but it was never my intention” she says. “I just make films about things that interest me.” What drew her to Williams, apart from his singularly rapid-fire wit, was his creative generosity, attested to by most everyone in the documentary, sometimes with a kind of rueful speculation about what it must’ve felt like inside Robin brain. Lewis Black, shown in the film on a USO tour of Afghanistan with Williams, calls him a light that “never knew how to turn himself off”. Another comedian, Eric Idle, says Williams “had a restless mind” and “didn’t feel worthy”. The film could delve deeper than it does into his demons, although its focus on Williams’ manic psyche, sometimes turbocharged by cocaine or a double-fist of tequila and espresso, suggests the lows were as extreme as the creative highs. By the time he died in a neuropathology known as Lewy body disease had depleted his dopamine levels, as his widow Susan Williams shared in an essay titled “The terrorist inside my husband brain”. Between all this are nods to his greatest hits – Good Morning, Vietnam, Dead Poets Society, Moscow on the Hudson and Good Will Hunting – and touching outtakes from Mrs Doubtfire, one of Williams’ most luminous comic flourishes. Generally, though, more attention is paid to his creativity than his biography. For a subject like Williams, the strategy makes sense: he gave so much of himself to audiences that, off stage, there was often no gas left in the tank. Today, we find ourselves clamoring to get to know celebrities as they are in “real life”, behind the makeup and careful public orchestrations. Williams, however, was that rare star whose humanity and spirit radiated from his every comic gesture.

44,"The widow of Robin Williams has lifted the lid on the actor struggle with a debilitating neurological disease in the months before he took his own life, likening it to “chemical warfare in his brain”. Writing in the journal of the American Academy of Neurology , Williams’ wife Susan Schneider Williams has detailed the final months of her husband life as the couple struggled to respond to his devastating decline in health. Williams took his own life in August . Three months before his death Williams was diagnosed with Parkinson , but Schneider Williams has previously revealed the autopsy identified that he had suffered from Lewy body disease (LBD). Why Robin Williams true genius lay in his weird and wonderful comedy In her essay, “the terrorist inside my husband brain”, she said doctors would later discover it was instead one of the worst cases they had ever seen. LBD is an incurable form of neurodegenerative disease . It is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer, with which it shares many symptoms, and can be misdiagnosed as Parkinson disease. In October on the couple second wedding anniversary, Williams experienced gut discomfort, and fear and anxiety which “skyrocketed to a point that was alarming”, Schneider Williams wrote. He had already been experiencing various physical ailments, which had been intermittent and which the couple and doctors had believed were unrelated. By December he would suffer from increasing levels of “paranoia, delusions and looping, insomnia, memory, and high cortisol levels”. After his death doctors found that a high concentration of Lewy bodies in his brain amygdala had caused the acute paranoia and “out-of-character emotional responses”. Schneider Williams described it as “chemical warfare in his brain”. “How I wish he could have known why he was struggling, that it was not a weakness in his heart, spirit, or character,” she said. Over the following months Williams suffered from panic attacks and memory loss, struggling to remember lines during the shooting of Night at the Museum . He kept saying, ‘I just want to reboot my brain’. His mental state declined, and Schneider Williams found herself increasingly unable to reassure his anxieties and insecurities. “Robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it. Can you imagine the pain he felt as he experienced himself disintegrating? And not from something he would ever know the name of, or understand? Neither he, nor anyone could stop it – no amount of intelligence or love could hold it back,” she said. “He kept saying, ‘I just want to reboot my brain’.” While had been diagnosed with Parkinson disease, Schneider Williams wrote that after his death it became apparent that, pathologically, he suffered from diffuse LBD. “One neuropathologist described LBD and [Parkinson disease] as being at opposite ends of a disease spectrum. That spectrum is based on something they share in common: the presence of Lewy bodies – the unnatural clumping of the normal protein, a-synuclein, within brain neurons,” she said. Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb review Schneider Williams said four doctors examined her husband autopsy report and final two years of medical records and they “indicated his was one of the worst pathologies they had seen”. “He had about loss of dopamine neurons and almost no neurons were free of Lewy bodies throughout the entire brain and brainstem.” She said the medical team had been on the right track in diagnosing and treating Williams before he died, but she would never know if that would have made a difference. “I am not convinced that the knowledge would have done much more than prolong Robin agony while he would surely become one of the most famous test subjects of new medicines and ongoing medical trials,” she said. “Even if we experienced some level of comfort in knowing the name, and fleeting hope from temporary comfort with medications, the terrorist was still going to kill him.” Schneider Williams, who was last week appointed to the American Brain Foundation board of directors, said she wrote the essay to increase neurologists’ understanding of patients and caregivers and to “add a few more faces” to the reasons they conduct research.

45,"Robin Williams was eager to play the half-giant gamekeeper Hagrid in the Harry Potter films – but was turned down by producers on account of his nationality. Casting director Janet Hirshenson has confirmed that Williams fell victim to the “Brits-only” rule imposed by producers on the series of films. “Robin had called because he really wanted to be in the movie,” she told the Huffington Post , “but it was a British-only edict, and once he said no to Robin, he wasn’t going to say yes to anybody else, that for sure. It couldn’t be.” The part went to Robbie Coltrane, who was reportedly JK Rowling first choice for Hagrid. Williams had spoken about his thwarted Potter ambitions, telling the New York Post in “There were a couple of parts I would have wanted to play, but there was a ban on [using] American actors.” Other key roles for which Williams was considered included leads in The Shining, Philadelphia, Richard Attenborough biopic of Charlie Chaplin and Gus van Sant film about Harvey Milk. He was also in the running for the part of a depressed professor in Little Miss Sunshine, which eventually went to Steve Carell.

46,"Kelly Marie Tran has spoken out about online bullying for the first time since she deleted her Instagram posts earlier this year. The star of Star Wars: The Last Jedi has revealed the extent of the abuse she received in an op-ed for the New York Times . The Last Jedi: what would the fan-funded remake look like? “Their words seemed to confirm what growing up as a woman and a person of color already taught me: that I belonged in margins and spaces, valid only as a minor character in their lives and stories,” Tran wrote. In the piece, she explains that she stopped speaking Vietnamese at the age of nine because she was tired of being mocked and that society continued to reinforce the idea that she could never be a hero but just a supporting character. “I had been brainwashed into believing that my existence was limited to the boundaries of another person approval,” she wrote. “I had been tricked into thinking that my body was not my own, that I was beautiful only if someone else believed it, regardless of my own opinion. I had been told and retold this by everyone: by the media, by Hollywood, by companies that profited from my insecurities, manipulating me so that I would buy their clothes, their makeup, their shoes, in order to fill a void that was perpetuated by them in the first place.” She stated that her experience is common for a person of color growing up in a white-dominated world and for a woman in a society that still prioritizes men. But Tran wants to use her position to make a difference. “I know that I now belong to a small group of privileged people who get to tell stories for a living, stories that are heard and seen and digested by a world that for so long has tasted only one thing,” she wrote. “I know how important that is. And I am not giving up.” After Tran deleted her posts this summer, a pro-“straight white male hero” group took credit as they continued to rally against “forced diversity”. The same group also tried to launch an unsuccessful campaign against Black Panther. Both films have made over each to date.

47,"ith at least one new film every year, you’d think it would be easy being a Star Wars fan in but it isn’t. That not because JJ Abrams killed off Han Solo in Episode VII , or The Last Jedi snuffed out Luke Skywalker. It isn’t because we never got to see Luke, Han and Leia fighting side-by-side, which would have been cool. It isn’t porgs , or that superfluous giraffe-horse bit in Episode VIII. And it most certainly isn’t due to the introduction of a character called Rose . None of these things make being a Star Wars fan remotely difficult. They’re just some things some film-makers put into a family film. No, there only one thing that makes Star Wars fandom a drag in and that is other Star Wars fans. Or, more specifically, that small yet splenetic subsection of so-called “fans” who take to the internet like the Wicked Witch from the West flying monkeys to troll the actors, directors and producers with bizarre, pathetic, racist, sexist and homophobic whingebaggery about the “injustices” that have been inflicted upon them. Truly, it embarrassing to share a passion with these people. It a poisonous tributary of fanboyism that appears again and again. Earlier this week, Kelly Marie Tran, the Vietnamese-American actor who plays Rose (and the first WoC in a lead role in the saga) deleted all her Instagram posts. While Tran hasn’t specifically stated that online trolling is the reason she left social media, since the release of The Last Jedi in December she been on the receiving end of a torrent of online abuse. Some comments voiced dissatisfaction with the character of Rose itself, or deemed it necessary to attack Tran personally about her performance. Others were more concerned about her gender and her race. For an idea of what she been dealing with, one individual even went so far as to amend Rose entry on the Wookiepedia Star Wars wiki to read, “Ching Chong Wing Tong is a dumbass fucking character Disney made and is a stupid, retarded, and autistic love interest for Finn. She better die in the coma because she is a dumbass bitch.” If constant invective like this is the reason for Tran leaving social media – if she thought it best to sever the unbroken line of communication between her and the type of person who thinks sending this to a stranger is the right thing to do – then you can hardly blame her. Sadly, seeing enthusiastic young actors being worn down by the corrosive surge of “fan” venom is nothing new. Daisy Ridley also left Instagram in John Boyega was forced to become a spokesperson for Bame actors everywhere and address racial abuse before Episode VII even came out, after the hashtag #BoycottStarWarsVII was circulated in response to the film “anti-white propaganda promoting #whitegenocide”, and the argument that “Jewish activist JJ Abrams is an anti-white nut”. A broiling nucleus of “fans” was also up in arms about the revelation that Lando Calrissian in Solo is pansexual, despite not having to suffer a single shot of him so much as playing footsie with another man. One “men activist” put together a “de-feminised” “Chauvinist Cut” of The Last Jedi with the female characters either excised or their important actions gifted to male counterparts. The edit description refers to Rose as “Asian chick” and “China girl”, and claims Gwendoline Christie Captain Phasma is easily killed by Finn, because “women are naturally weaker than men”. It worrying, baffling stuff. You’d think it was a joke if the person in question hadn’t gone to the considerable effort of making the thing. Those are of course extreme islands of toxic fandom within the passionate, overwhelmingly positive world of Star Wars appreciation and debate. A campaign to gazump The Last Jedi score on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes by down-voting it seems tame by comparison, almost benign. Some people didn’t like the film, which is fine, and voicing this opinion is exactly what Rotten Tomatoes is for. It isn’t until you remember that similar down-vote protest campaigns were waged against Marvel Black Panther and the all-female Ghostbusters reboot (alongside a horrific barrage of racist abuse suffered by Ghostbusters’ Leslie Jones ) that an ugly pattern of concerted attacks on diversity and representation begins to coalesce. From Comic Book Guy to Tim from Spaced screaming at that small boy about The Phantom Menace , fantasy and sci-fi have always gone hand-in-hand with a kind of boundless enthusiasm that doesn’t apply to other genres. And this is what makes being a sci-fi fan brilliant. If you want to sign a harmless petition to have The Last Jedi removed from Star Wars canon, then that is entirely your choice. But what happening to Kelly Marie Tran is different, and it important not to casually conflate good, honest, red-cheeked arguments about Star Wars and geek culture as a whole with these isolated yet incandescent pockets of racism, homophobia or sexism. It the same gulf that exists between a football fan and a hooligan. Sci-fi is the vehicle for their bigotry, not the cause. Anyone who followed GamerGate is probably already drawing parallels between the misogyny of that sorry affair and these hissy fits in reaction to harmless pieces of family entertainment. The most vocal offenders in Tran case, as always, are an infinitesimal minority of the millions around the world who enjoy the films, or at least don’t feel the need to harass those they perceive as being to blame if they don’t. These males – and it is males – feel they have ownership over a piece of entertainment: that geekdom is their safe space, theirs alone, and the newfound mass popularity of the genre is bringing a lot of casuals into their hitherto predominantly straight, white, male dojo. Diversity isn’t what some of them want. Which is bizarre, considering the benefits of diversity are what quite a lot of sci-fi is actually about. But it not what these people believe they paid for, and therefore see themselves of having part-ownership of. The sense of entitlement is staggering. The internet provides the tiny, troublesome few a platform to have their wobbly lipped wails heard, not only by the widest possible audience, but by the film-makers themselves. Rian Johnson, The Last Jedi writer-director, took to Twitter to label Tran attackers “ manbabies ”. You get the feeling that there were probably a few other words he would have preferred to use. Of course, the best thing we could all do is ignore these trolls, and leave them pounding their fists into their pillows in impotent fury, while the rest of us real fans get on with the important business of lobbying Lucasfilm to release the original “Han shot first” cut of Episode IV in But that easy to say without an Instagram feed full of hatred, bigotry and personal threats. “A few unhealthy people can cast a big shadow on the wall,” Johnson went on to say. “But over the past years I’ve met lots of real fellow SW fans. We like &amp; dislike stuff but we do it with humor, love &amp; respect. We’re the VAST majority, we’re having fun &amp; doing just fine.” He right, but every time the sludge at the bottom of the Star Wars fan bucket makes the news, it gets harder and harder to remember that.",1230,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/07/kelly-marie-tran-rose-why-are-some-star-wars-fans-so-toxic
48,"You come at the king, you best not miss. Last week, an attempt to maliciously derail the record-setting rollout of Black Panther – Marvel upcoming blockbuster spotlighting the lithe warrior-monarch T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) – was itself promptly derailed. A scurrilous Facebook event page, whose stated purpose was to “give Black Panther a rotten audience score on Rotten Tomatoes” purported to be a grassroots protest against Disney and its “treatment of franchises and its fanboys”. Amid garbled claims that the corporation that owns Marvel had somehow paid off critics to trash the recent crop of superhero movies from their longstanding rival DC, the page organisers encouraged the use of hashtags like #DownWithDisney and #DCOverMarvel as social media rallying points. For some commentators, posting a negative rating was a chance to complain about Star Wars becoming too progressive Plotting to scuttle a film Rotten Tomatoes audience score sight unseen seems, at best, underhanded. But the fact this attack was aimed at the most high-profile movie ever to feature a predominantly black cast felt racist. Facebook quickly deleted the event on the grounds that it “violated the company community standards”. Rotten Tomatoes, the longstanding film reviews aggregation site that dishes out “fresh” or “rotten” ratings to new releases, responded in even stronger terms : “While we respect our fans’ diverse opinions, we do not condone hate speech.” In an era when culture wars are predominantly fought on social media, this sort of down-voting can seem like an effective guerrilla tactic. Clicking on an angry red face or selecting zero stars is even easier than adding your name to an online petition, and such basic actions can often be automated. The pre-emptive thumbs-down pile-on that accompanied the female-led Ghostbusters in – one of the most high-profile instances of the toxic impulse to prejudge art that doesn’t fit in with some preconceived notion of what a franchise should be – means that it still holds the queasy distinction of being the most disliked film trailer on YouTube . When YouTube launched in Rotten Tomatoes had already been operational for seven years. But recently the site has become a more fractious battleground, where the professional critical consensus – a film final Tomatometer score is determined by assessing reviews from a pool of vetted critics – meets public opinion in the form of crowdsourced audience reactions. Perhaps Rotten Tomatoes was so quick to respond to the Black Panther controversy because of the divisive response to another high-profile Disney property. The Last Jedi was officially certified fresh after scoring among critics, a stark contrast to the average score it received from audience reactions. For some of these commentators, posting a negative rating was a chance to complain about their favourite franchise becoming too progressive, too feminised or too interested in presenting diversity. (Others just didn’t like the jokes.) The #DownWithDisney agitators suggested they had successfully manipulated The Last Jedi audience score using bots , a claim denied by Rotten Tomatoes. There are examples of similar Rotten Tomatoes score discrepancies with no conspiracy theories swirling around them. The recent PT Barnum musical The Greatest Showman , a big-top passion project from Hugh Jackman, was considered rotten by critics, with a rating on the Tomatometer, while its audience score is a much healthier (from around reviews), which would seem to chime with its remarkable ongoing box-office run . There are no claims that a rabid group of diehard Wolverine fans has been artificially inflating The Greatest Showman audience score to help their hero. Black Panther: does the Marvel epic solve Hollywood Africa problem? The Last Jedi has also made bucketloads of cash, so do these Rotten Tomatoes scores really matter? Last year, the site found itself being blamed by Hollywood executives for the failure of would-be blockbusters Baywatch and The Mummy during a particularly lacklustre summer. (Just a few months later, those claims were being discredited .) More recently, clever marketers have worked out ways to weave an impressive Tomatometer showing seamlessly into a marketing campaign. Greta Gerwig coming-of-age tale Lady Bird has been nominated for multiple Oscars and one key thread of that successful awards narrative was that it was Rotten Tomatoes’ new top-rated movie , beating Toy Story record for consecutive positive reviews. (Lady Bird has since been bested by Paddington .) Even if its splodgy icons of plump juicy veg and snot-green splats can seem rather reductive, Rotten Tomatoes has evolved into a valuable platform for dialogue between cultural gatekeepers and impassioned fans. That why keeping it clear of hate speech can only be a good thing.",760,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/05/black-panther-fought-off-a-toxic-ghostbusters-online-campaign-rotten-tomatoes
49,"In a world full of sadness, nothing has radiated joy quite like the internet plan to remake The Last Jedi. Star Wars spin-offs put on hold after Solo crashes at box office The @RMTheLastJedi Twitter account and its quixotic us-versus-the-world quest to fix Star Wars by servicing every clenched-sphincter whim of every possessive, damp-duveted Star Wars “fan” represents the all-time human pinnacle of heroic pointlessness. It is beautiful to witness, like discovering a rare flower in the foothill of a remote mountainside, only to realise that it smells of urine and makes a sad trumpet noise whenever a bee gets too close (even The Last Jedi director, Rian Johnson, has shared his amusement ). Better yet, the account claims that the remake is nearly funded – last night it apparently crossed the mark in pledges – which means a script should be imminent. So, @RMTheLastJedi, if you’re reading, please consider this sincere treatment submission. AHCH-TO. We open where JJ left us, as REY presents a reclusive LUKE SKYWALKER with her lightsaber. This time, Luke grabs it without hesitation. He throws on a cool pair of shades. Out of nowhere, the opening riff to THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST by IRON MAIDEN screams from the speakers. Luke smiles in slow motion, flips the bird at those LAME FISH-NUN THINGS and hops aboard his cool new ride, a space motorbike shaped like a giant penis. Just as BRUCE DICKINSON screams “YEEEEEEEEEAH!”, fire spurts out of the back of the motorbike and Luke takes off, pausing only to shoot Rey with a laser beam that turns her into a hot babe with a sexy perm. As she gyrates to the music in a gold bikini, Luke pulls his sunglasses down his nose and winks. Rey instantly orgasms but Luke has already left. That how cool he is. Next stop: D’QAR, where Resistance forces are under attack from the First Order. Luke space-bike zooms in out of nowhere and power-slides to a standstill between the opposing factions. He looks to his left and sees KYLO REN and GENERAL HUX. He looks to his right and sees FINN and ROSE cowering like losers. As the powerful shaft of his bike begins to glow, we once again hear Bruce Dickinson scream “YEEEEEEEEEAH!” and the bike blows up the entire Resistance in a sick fireball. “I’m the one true rebel now, baby,” says Luke. He looks down at the charred corpses of Rose and Finn, surrounded by the dead bodies of ANY OTHER CHARACTERS WHO AREN’T WHITE OR MALE (and also BARACK OBAMA and MY MOTHER for making me clean my room on a Saturday), pulls his sunglasses down nose and quips: “Sorry, guys, you’re just not relatable enough.” Every single bra in the entire universe pings off upon hearing such effortless wit. Luke zooms off, leaving behind a cloud that looks like Rian Johnson giving Jar Jar Binks a blowjob. Next Luke travels to the beautiful planet of JOR’DAN P’TERSON, a world where men are men and women are all hydraulic sex housewives who’ve been programmed never to laugh at your genitals, no matter how scarred and minuscule they happen to be. At the temple of Lucaas, Luke meets YODA and CHEWBACCA for an ice-cold beer. BOBA FETT strolls in wearing a MAGA cap. “The coolest, that guy still is,” says YODA. But this doesn’t solve the problem of Starkiller Base, which still threatens to blow up the whole galaxy. So Luke takes the best possible course of action: re-creating the final act of A NEW HOPE beat for beat over and over again for two hours, which is the only thing that fans want anyway. The base explodes, Iron Maiden blares out of the speakers and Luke Skywalker negs a sexy alien until she agrees to have sex with him. All is right with the galaxy once more.

50,"s this the real trailer? Is this just fantasy? A film once caught in a landslide, after disagreements with cast (Sacha Baron Cohen departed acrimoniously) and crew (director Bryan Singer was fired earlier this year), looks like it has finally managed to get back on track. And here to prove it is a shiny Queen-approved trailer , which would appear to belie Freddie Mercury assertion that there “no escape from reality”. Bohemian Rhapsody: first trailer of Queen and Freddie Mercury biopic released When Baron Cohen quit the film, he made sure to shoot it in the foot , by going public with the fact that certain people wanted the film to be more about the great successes of the still very current band Queen than about the extraordinary and non-PG-friendly life of the guy who was their frontman before Adam Lambert . The trailer would seem to support his claims. It opens on footage of Freddie Mercury in concert at various moments in his career with Queen, singing a call-and-response refrain that chanted back to him by a rapturous audience. There no opportunity to focus particularly on the face of Rami Malek as Mercury in these opening moments: we’re in the business of witnessing the guy as rock star, in a quickly spliced montage with lots of costume changes, waving arms and our first glimpse, on the drumkit, of the word “Queen”, which will appear a grand total of five times in the trailer. Next we get a change of music, title cards, and our second look at the word “Queen”, this time in glossy closeup. At this point, I don’t know about you but I’m beginning to get the distinct impression that Freddie Mercury may have been in Queen. The trailer then merges into a mashup of Bohemian Rhapsody and Another One Bites the Dust, over a succession of images including a sexy exchange of looks between Freddie Mercury and a woman in the audience, whom we see again near him a couple of frames later. A glancing touch of hands between Mercury and a man follows a little later still. Quick gender recap at the mark: women two, men one. Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go. A caption comes up in big letters – this is going to be good. “The Only Thing… More Extraordinary … Than Their Music … Is His Story” More extraordinary than? Surely that should be “as extraordinary as”. There nothing said of Mercury love life, ​no​ illness, no emotion, nothing dangerous or overtly queer to offend anyone The montage ends, and there follows some guff about the writing of the song Bohemian Rhapsody , which we are told contains an operatic section (in the only line in the trailer spoken by Freddie Mercury) and is over six minutes long, which proves displeasing to a music executive. A band member who isn’t Brian May or Freddie Mercury (Dave … Bridges? Mike … Benton? Alan … Jones?) makes a heterosexist wisecrack at the boring exec, then the trailer is back on music business, closing out with the Brian May-written We Will Rock You, in order to signal to the audience that Queen will rock us. To misquote Freddie Mercury: do stop this now, I’m having such a bad time. Not a word of dialogue is spoken in the trailer that doesn’t pertain to the music of Queen: nothing of Mercury love life, no illness, no emotion, nothing dangerous or overtly queer to offend anyone. To quote Brian May: big disgrace! The whole thing has the flavour of something strenuously queerwashed, which has removed everything wild and interesting about Mercury. This trailer would appear to presage a film with no interest in sounding the ambiguities of his life, the abrasive queerness of his perspective, the virulence of the homophobic press in their attacks on him – what, in a word, made him tick. If the film remains true to this trailer, it represents a truly tragic lost opportunity to celebrate an ambiguous and excitingly transgressive figure, whose tragically short life was filled with incident. Mercury deserves to be celebrated as a queer icon quite beyond the machismo and daddishness of Queen fandom. From his origins as a Parsi man of colour to his underexamined private life, via his struggle with Aids at the height of the epidemic that claimed so many LGBTQ lives, we need to know more about this figure. Not for nothing has Bryan Fuller already attacked the film for these seeming omissions . On the other hand, there is a proud tradition in the queer community of reclaiming cultural artefacts such as this, and the film could become a true camp classic a la Mommie Dearest , with queer audiences screaming along to all the bowdlerised bits. We await it with feverish excitement. This article was amended on May An earlier version described Freddy Mercury as a Farsi man of colour.",821,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/16/freddie-mercury-biopic-trailer-queen-bohemian-rhapsody-queerwash
51,"Samantha Morton wants to get one thing straight. She does not think of herself as a film director. Has no aspirations in that area. This is a one-off. Just something she had to get out of her system. For half her life, she wanted to tell this story, needed to tell this story, and now she done it, so she happy to leave it at that. The Unloved is a bleak and beautiful drama about a little girl in a care home. The girl, Lucy, just happens to have ice-blue eyes and look how we might imagine the young Sam to look. She is rejected by her mother, beaten by her father, thrown into a Nottinghamshire home where she gets into trouble with the police, runs away time and again, and witnesses yet more abuse. All the time, she is looking for one thing: love. Somebody to love her, somebody she can love. Everything in the film is seen from Lucy perspective. We stare up towards an adult waist and the terrifying prospect of a belt being unbuckled, sounds are heightened (birdsong, a running bath, the swish of the belt), and elements of the story are left unexplained because Lucy simply does not know, for example, why her mother can't look after her. She could be selfish, physically ill, mentally ill, or all three. The Unloved is Ken Loach on downers. It offers little in the way of hope or consolation - and it is a brilliant depiction of aloneness. Morton, now was when she started storyboarding the film. She was living in a hostel for the homeless when she read an article about a young prostitute in Nottingham and realised this was somebody she had known in care. Years later, she read about two other girls she'd known who had also become prostitutes and had been murdered. The reports had a huge impact on her. She wanted to tell their stories, and her own story, and create something fictional, all at the same time. She started to write scripts, but rejected them as rubbish. ""I'm not a writer. I think I can write short stories and poetry, but film writing, brilliant film writing, is a talent - you can't just do it like that."" She clicks her fingers. Eventually, she asked Tony Grisoni, who adapted David Peace Red Riding trilogy for television, to write the screenplay, and he created a film that is not about murdered prostitutes, and not literally her life story, but is close enough to make her family shudder with recognition. ""There are a lot of similarities between me and Lucy, but my mum and my dad and my eight brothers and sisters can all watch the film and go, 'We know that not our story, but we get why she done it.' At the same time I do love them and I do respect them, and I'm not about to exploit them."" Morton was first taken into care as a baby. She never learned why as a child, and remains unsure to this day. Everybody concerned - mother, father, social services - has a different version of the truth. Family life was certainly not helped when her father got the babysitter pregnant (he went on to marry her) and her mother moved in with an alcoholic. There were times when Morton returned to live with her father until she was eight. Then she was made a ward of court, which meant she could never return home - again, something she didn't know at the time. She describes her father as a ""brilliant man"", a huge influence on her life, so desperate to be a good dad. She has not always felt like this about him. Did he hit her? ""Yes. Yep."" Badly? ""Yep."" The most horrific thing about the violence in The Unloved is its inevitability. However senseless, and however much Lucy father tries to stop himself, we know just what coming next. He even provides a tortured running commentary as his willpower fails him. I ask Morton if her father hit her in a similar way. ""I think anybody who has been abused as a kid - and I was abused as a kid, by various people - will say it irrational because violence is irrational. It is a criminal offence for you to hit me or me to hit you, but it is not a criminal offence for a parent to hit a child. What gives one person the right to be violent with another person, especially a person who cannot understand? Baby P... My mind boggles at the amount of violence inflicted upon children in today society."" When I first meet Morton I don't recognise her. As an actress, she has a remarkable gift for playing real people rather than ""characters""; in films such as Control and Under The Skin, she is unadorned, simply dressed, raw to the core. Today, she looks as if she stepped straight off the set of a Victorian melodrama. Her hair is wrapped, dense and high, in a bird nest, her dress low cut, full-length and floral, her fingers clamped in vintage rings. But this is not Morton in character, this is Morton as herself. ""I look like a cross between an Enid Blyton character and a prostitute."" She laughs, quietly at first, then louder and louder, like a batty Julie Walters creation of years ago, She always been locked into the past, she says. In The Unloved, Lucy hardly says a word. Rather than living her life, she seems to be observing it. Morton says this is common in abused children. ""You read a lot about this in psychology, how children almost astral project. They throw themselves out of their body and it almost bordering on the autistic spectrum. They are spectators of their reality. They are quite numb."" That why the sound is so heightened, she says, because Lucy is living in the echo-chamber of her own head. From the age of eight, Morton moved between care homes and foster parents. Any number of them - she can't remember how many. She says The Unloved is a censored version of what she experienced. What did she dilute? ""Violence, sexual abuse, torture..."" If she had included everything, nobody would have believed her, and anyway, it was always intended to be a film that children could watch. ""I'm not going to make a children film and turn it into a horror film. I wanted to make a film that someone from the age of could watch and get, and it would change them."" It was also important to Morton that the film would be shown on television before its cinema release. After all, she says, that where people such as her experienced film for the first time, watching the likes of Kes on the telly at school. It funny, she says, when she was really little she was a right scrapper, frightened of nothing or nobody. ""If somebody bullied someone else, I'd go and knock them out."" Then she withdrew into herself. And eventually she found a new kind of strength. ""One day I just thought, what can you do to me, really?"" She sings me a line from the Robin Hood song: ""He a fighter not looking for a fight"" and says that her. ""My answer in my late adolescence was not fight back. It was to say, you can do anything to me but you won't really upset me. That why Psalm is at the beginning of the film: 'The Lord is my light... Whom shall I fear?' Because you can do anything to me, physically, but you can't get in here,"" she says pointing to her heart, or maybe her soul. The Catholicism she grew up with - iconic imagery, knees sore from praying, guilt - never really leaves you, she says, no matter how much you might think you have left it. Morton went to a good comprehensive school, neighbouring a wealthy area. But she always felt an outsider. ""The houses on that road are million-pound ones, yet I was living in a children home two buses away, where I was up most nights because of riots or sharing a room with a prostitute. You can't get your homework done and you fall behind."" At she left school for the last time, spending most of her early teens raving, taking ecstasy and hallucinogenics with older children and young adults, lawless and lost. Sometimes she returned, or was returned, to the homes or foster parents. Between and she was homeless for almost a year, sleeping at friends' houses or in bus shelters. How close does she think she was to screwing up her life irredeemably? ""Massively. Completely. Massively."" Does she think she could have ended up selling sex, like the friends who were murdered? ""No, not that kind of darkness. No, for me it was drugs."" Although Morton turned her back on school, she was jealous of those who had a regular education. ""I had a massive chip on my shoulder, like a big bag of McCains. I walked past the girls' high school in Nottingham, a private school, and I'd see them bunking off, and I'd think, you twats, your parents are spending a fortune on your education. I was very bitter, I suppose. My appetite for knowledge and literature and music was massive. The reason I didn't go to school was because, at that point, I'd already - excuse my language - fucked it because I'd run away so much when I was younger."" So she determined to educate herself. ""Someone said to me if you read the Guardian and the Times every day, you'll learn everything you need to know."" Who was it? ""A drug dealer of mine."" She smiles. Presumably, much of her anger was directed at her parents? No, she says instantly. ""Never, never my parents. Always authority. Always the establishment. That because I grew up in Nottinghamshire in the with Margaret Thatcher destroying everything."" As for her mother, she says she would make a great character in a Loach film. ""She lost a lot of her rights as a woman and a mother very early on. I'm not going into it too much, it her business."" It surprising, and touching, how protective she is of her parents. ""Just because somebody doesn't bring up their children or can't look after their children doesn't make them a bad person,"" she says of her mother. ""There are all sorts of reasons - illness. There are so many reasons you can end up in care."" In addition to raving, her other source of release through her early teens was acting. Here she could lose herself in a healthier way. At she was picked to join the Central Television Workshop for young actors. Her intensity marked her out as special and a little scary - if she was asked to improvise conflict, it would often nearly end in a fight. At she moved to London and was cast in roles uncomfortably close to her own history - in Cracker she played a pregnant teenager (Morton had an abortion at a car thief in Boon, a junkie, homicidal prostitute in Band Of Gold. She has a knack of bringing a disarming, everyday quality to extreme characters. In Under The Skin, one of her first starring roles, Iris is a woman numb with grief who beds stranger after stranger as she tries to force her way back into feeling. As Myra Hindley in Longford she flits from vulnerable tenderness to monstrous manipulation, toying with us so subtly that we're never sure where we stand. Occasionally, her characters are so quiet they almost disappear - in Control, it is such a shock when downtrodden Debbie Curtis finally raises her voices and stands up for herself, you almost jump out of your seat. Good actors are often said to unpeel layers of skin in front of us. At her best, Morton doesn't seem to have skin in the first place. Sometimes, I say, acting almost appears to be an out-of-body experience for her. She nods enthusiastically: ""When I do takes at work, if I'm not completely somewhere else I always have to go again. It almost like madness."" And she says that she unlikely to direct another film, however well The Unloved does. ""I'm an actor. That what I'm gifted at. It what makes me breathe. People say when they self-harm it to breathe, to live. My self-harm, if you like, is acting, because I feel alive when I do it. I cannot live without it."" In the past she has said things got so bad that in her mid-teens she contemplated killing herself. I ask why, and she goes quiet. Look, she says, you're young and homeless, you're involved in drugs and crime, you think you're in control and you're anything but. ""You're still a kid and you think you're a grown-up. I did awful things at times, and I did those awful things through being under the influence of drugs or not being kind to myself and not loving myself and not knowing how to be kind."" She pauses. ""Between the ages of and I was in a very dark place and then came out of it."" ""Were you stealing a lot?"" ""Um, yeah, but no,"" she says. ""I had to steal my food. I stole from shops to eat, and that different from stealing for the sake of it, for fun or a dare."" How did that darkness express itself? Through depression? ""No. I got into trouble with the police quite seriously as a kid. And I thought, this could affect the rest of my life."" Did you get convicted? ""As a mother I have to be very careful what I say. Everything I say to you now I have to feel I could have that conversation with my children because it going to be in print."" Did the conviction result in a sentence? ""Yes."" For a week or a month or a year? ""It was an sentence at an attendance centre."" And was that what changed you? ""Yes, revolutionised me. I felt humbled, I felt remorse, I felt embarrassed. I felt better than the way I was treating myself. I was a twat. I was a little twat. I can be kinder to myself and say there were reasons why, but at the end of the day you can't justify certain things, you have to grow up and get on with it."" We talk a week later. She been thinking a lot about the conviction and says that if ever there were a time to talk about it, it now, with the film. ""I was physically abused, bullied by someone for a long time, and I retaliated. We were kids, products of a crap environment. The only person I hurt in the end was myself."" She explains what happened. ""There was a riot in the home, a fire, it was like a mini Strangeways. The police were already there, and I'd been tripping and was still a bit out of it. I threatened to kill the girl and picked up a knife. I didn't touch her - wouldn't have touched her - but the police restrained me and then arrested me. ""I was locked in a cell for three days. It was terrible. I just sat there thinking, I don't want this life - I'm not a petty criminal, I'm not a thug. But that how they were treating me, understandably. I was so ashamed of myself."" The case went to the local youth court, then the crown court. She was charged with attempted murder, but was eventually convicted of the lesser charge of threats to kill. Morton says there was a terrible sense of history repeating itself; her stepfather, whom she calls inspirational, was in prison at the time - for attempted murder. ""Some of the homes I was in were fine, but this place was awful. It being closed down now. I go into homes today and see kids like I was, like this girl was, and I just want to take them home and look after them."" Even today, the conviction has an impact on her life. Whenever she wants to travel to America to work, she has to fight for a visa. ""When I did Sweet And Lowdown, I had to sit down with Woody Allen and explain everything. Awful. It happens all the time."" On the one hand her childhood is in the past - but it a past she still coming to terms with. ""Look,"" she says, ""things have gone swimmingly since I was It largely true. She has worked consistently, she has made blockbusters in Hollywood (Minority Report with Tom Cruise), she been nominated for two Oscars (Allen Sweet And Lowdown and Jim Sheridan In America), and starred in more than her fair share of British arthouse classics (Morvern Callar, Control, Under The Skin). She has made money along the way, campaigned against the closure of state-funded children homes (however corrupted they are, in some cases they remain the safest option) and been embraced as one of the great actors of her generation. ""And two children,"" she interjects. ""I think the best thing in my life is my ability to be in a stable relationship. For anybody who has been in care or moved around a lot, it very tough to form strong, lasting relationships. And that what I'm proudest of."" She has been with her fiancé, Harry Holm, son of actor Ian Holm, for four years. Their baby, Edie, is months old. ""He my first serious partner. Anybody who has been in care says if you achieve that, that is success. You're happy."" They live in London with the two children and five cats. She used to have - most of them strays. ""People bring them to me. I think of myself as a cat foster mum."" Yet, in true Morton fashion, not everything has been easy. She split up with the father of her older daughter, Esme, now nine, before the birth. She has a history of troubled relationships. Professionally, she got a reputation for being difficult. (Fair enough, she says, she was difficult in the past, telling crew members to shut it if they were chatting away when she was giving her all - she works hard and expects others to do so, too.) And two years ago she suffered a freak stroke after her ceiling collapsed on her. She says it was terrifying, especially as a young mother. ""A piece of plaster fell on my head. I went to the hospital and everything was OK, and then it wasn't. I spent a long time in rehab learning how to walk and getting better, and then went straight off to make Synecdoche, New York."" Is she OK now? ""I still have a slight disfluency, sentences are spaced differently, but I was given a clean bill of health."" She knows how lucky she been - in every way. But she not one for complacency. There always something nudging her, whispering in her ear, asking if she making the best use of her life. ""There are days when I thank my lucky stars that I'm OK and that I'm sane, and wonder how I ended up doing this job. Then there are days when I think, is this the right job for me still? Shouldn't I be doing something in social care or politics?"" Does she think she will some day? ""Yeah, definitely. I think I will combine the two and find my way, doing something with charity work, and helping the government with reform of the way children are treated, educating young people. Some people have had a tough time, they've been in care or whatever, and they leave it behind them. Off they go and ride off into the sunset with a nice house and, y'know..."" She pauses.

52,"his year Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging turns – the same age I was when the film was first released in (in cinemas that still sold reasonably priced tickets). It only seems like yesterday that a large audience of pre-teen girls discovered this homage to the travails of teenage life. Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging was the lovechild of two novels by Louise Rennison : Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging and It OK, I’m Wearing Really Big Knickers Despite the elaborate title, the film realistically schooled girls on what life was like: we were about to become spotty, hormonal teenagers but we would learn to love ourselves. Why is it that years later, we millennials are still talking about a film that followed the life of a normal girl and not much else? In fact, was a boom year for coming-of-age films. Disney Channel debuted Camp Rock , which drew viewers on its first day. (Ask the majority of and they’ll remember the agonising final scene, where Demi Lovato sings This Is Me and we all cry because we know Joe Jonas is going to come on stage and sing with her. It was a big deal.) Wild Child was released the same year, and a large numbers of pre-teens begged their families to send them to a boarding school so they could be like Emma Roberts. Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging showed up in July, the start of the summer holidays – but it was no Cliff Richard singalong, it was the real deal. No going to a summer camp and meeting rock stars, no going to boarding school. Fourteen-year-old Georgia Nicholson (played by Georgia Groome) wants a boyfriend … and that the plot of the film. A conventional teenage girl who goes to a typical high school, set in harmonious Eastbourne. She does’t have a famous father or a model mother, she was simply one of us. And when it comes to coming-of-age films, that what the audience wants, a connection between the main character and themselves. Film review: Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging There an elephant in the room with coming-of-age films: none of the characters really want to grow up. Angus centres itself on the burning issue of body image, and confronting puberty straight on with a Venus razor in hand. One of the key moments in the film is when Georgia and her friends, who label themselves “the ace crew”, take part in “The Physical Attractiveness Test”. This lighthearted act is damaging and very common within friendship groups. Watching the film as a unaware that someone might care to rate my nose out of I was puzzled. Viewed with hindsight, the film presents the upsetting truth of how appearance-conscious young people are, while teaching us not to give a flying one what other people think – even if the graphic slurping sounds of Georgia snogging lessons put a lot of off making the move. Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging taught me, that while I might argue with friends, take boys out of the equation and we might get along better. At the end of the film, Jas rips another girls breast pads out of her dress for being horrible to Georgia and their friendship is rekindled. It not a fairytale where all girls are magically friends with one another, but it does reveal how girls can fall out over petty things and still reconcile by the end. Ten years on and the film is still inspiring audiences to dress up as olives and not to shave their eyebrows. What did the film teach us millennials? To be ourselves, have a laugh and ignore all the seriousness of adult life until we were at least But what it never taught us, was why Libby puts Angus in the fridge. I guess that something for the sequel, if there ever is one.",645,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/jul/25/angus-thongs-and-perfect-snogging-life-primer-that-means-so-much-to-millennials
53,"f you’ve read any of these trailer reviews before, you’ll know that they operate to a rigid formula. I watch the trailer, I screengrab the trailer and then I make a series of hackneyed non-jokes about the trailer. This approach works for most films; but not The Onania Club. The trailer for The Onania Club – Tom Six barely anticipated follow-up to the Human Centipede trilogy – was released yesterday. It is seconds long, and it cannot be screengrabbed. This is because, in its entirety, The Onania Club trailer just consists of women masturbating to That it. A woman knocks on the door of a mansion, and an older woman answers. She smiles, and then the trailer cuts to a living room, where four women masturbate to a television showing footage of a plane hitting the World Trade Center. Then there a Schopenhauer quote and it ends. That the entire trailer. Vile and inhumane: the director of The Human Centipede is back Perhaps Six chose this clip because it destined to become the most notorious scene of the movie. Or perhaps it the only scene in the movie. Because Six doesn’t really make movies. If you’ve seen his previous work, you’ll know his process just involves having one puerile idea and padding it out to feature length with all manner of tedious, no-effort explanation. So perhaps that what this is. Perhaps The Onania Club exists because Six wanted to film some middle-aged women touching themselves to a terrorist atrocity, and the rest of the film is just stilted, piss-poor dialogue delivered by dismal non-actors who’d almost definitely feel more career satisfaction if they quit the industry and started working in a shop. I have seen The Onania Club trailer exactly once, and I’m in no hurry to see it again. Not because I find it particularly offensive or insulting; which, let be clear, is exactly what Six wants from this. No, I’m never going to watch the Onania Club trailer again because I’m tired. I’m tired of Six witless tee-hee provocation. Other writers who have seen the trailer have described how it stirred feelings of rage in them, but I can’t even muster that. At best, there a sense of resignation that I suppose this is just how the world is. The Onania Club trailers exists, in the same way that inert gases exist. Great. Hooray. Six wants us to hate this so badly. Even his description of The Onania Club – “Strong, rich, white LA women (über bitches) run the show and deeply enjoy the misery of others. The film will be a pleasant breath of polluted air in today growing political correctness and intolerance” – is crudely designed to flamethrow snowflakes. It contorts itself silly to hit as many triggers as it can, presumably because Six knows that if he relied on basic quality for publicity he’d die in obscurity next week. Watching all his effort, all his pointless desperation to just be noticed by anyone is exhausting. There going to be a film in which actors simulate masturbation to footage of thousands of people dying. If you’re a boy, please enjoy this film; both the sole microsecond of arousal you’ll feel in the moment and the ensuing decades of low-level, relationship-destroying self-hatred you’ll inevitably have to grapple with as a result of ever wanting to watch it in the first place. But you’ll have to excuse me for not joining you. I am so tired.",578,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/jul/17/the-onania-club-trailer-tom-six
54,"n the face of it, Hereditary is a slice of silly supernatural hokum replete with the threadbare tropes of the genre. However, Ari Aster debut scarer has nonetheless struck a nerve : it seems to linger in the minds of those who see it. Why? Many horror films (Blair Witch, The Babadook, It Follows) jog the Jungian subconscious to tickle merely fanciful fears. Others (Carrie, Don’t Look Now, Get Out ) dare to touch upon real-world terrors. Often, it the latter whose spectres persist. Hereditary has been compared to Rosemary Baby , which Aster himself has cited as an inspiration. That film actual bugaboo was not so much satanism as the inexorability of the maternal instinct. Polanski message was stark enough, but Aster rapport with reality is more opaque. Hereditary isn’t to be interpreted as a madwoman delusion awaiting psychiatric deconstruction. “It is literal,” its writer/director has assured us . Yet of course that doesn’t stop it functioning as a metaphor, whatever its author intention. A metaphor for what? Perhaps the clue in the title. Toni Collette Annie, the protagonist of Hereditary, is the spawn of forebears who are schizoid, sociopathic, suicidal and malevolent, whatever their occult status. Their influence constricts her will and controls her behaviour. Even the motherhood she embodies wasn’t a role of her choosing. According to Aster , she “knows on some buried, suppressed level that her life is not her own”. The incubus that inhabits Annie goes on to infect her daughter Charlie and her son Peter, but not her genetically distinct husband. When obeying its malign instructions, she declares herself to be sleep-walking. Annie fate reflects a vision of the human condition that has deep roots, but today invokes dread. Could we be prisoners of our genes rather than self-realising agents? Are we sleep-walking like Annie, rather than creating our own essence? Does inheritance make nonsense of human life? Peter teacher asks the class if a Sophoclean hero downfall is more or less tragic because it is fated rather than willed. Comes the answer: more tragic, because destiny precludes hope. Self-realisation has become the creed of a solipsistic world. We each demand the right to define, adorn, improve and promote an identity of our own. The notion that our scope for doing so might be confined by our DNA is an affront that refuses to compute. It threatens not only our personhood, but our sense of the society through which we move. We like to believe that disagreeable attitudes spring from faulty environmental conditioning. That way, we can convince ourselves they're reversible Our commitment to engineering social progress presumes we can correct unwelcome behaviour. We like to believe that disagreeable attitudes spring from faulty environmental conditioning. That way, we can convince ourselves they’re reversible. Criminality is put down to deprivation; social justice is therefore the answer. Racism and misogyny are bad habits fostered by ignorance; they just need to be called out. Girls want to be princesses because Disney has brainwashed them. So, bring on Wonder Woman and Ocean Yet if the traits involved are genetically rooted, they won’t be eradicated by education, shaming or shiny new role-models. Cherished nostrums would lose their lustre. Rehabilitation might not be the solution to offending after all. Different races might indeed have different characteristics. A variation in spatial awareness might even make one gender better than the other at parking cars. Toxic masculinity might turn out to be just masculinity. The current dearth of social mobility is put down to the perpetuation of privilege . Well-heeled parents are assumed to bequeath advantage to their children by buying them superior education and enrolling them in their networks. Yet suppose something more is involved. The successful indulge in “assortative mating” , that is, they pair with each other. If they can jointly pass on intelligence, assertiveness and personability, a blind curriculum vitae won’t inhibit their offspring advance. Our belief in the plasticity of the human mindset would turn out to be an illusion concocted to escape an unacceptable reality, just as the afterlife was invented to get round our distaste for death. A prominent role for heredity may pose an obvious challenge to the progressive worldview, but it would also threaten the outlook of the right. If the fault lies in our genes, personal responsibility goes out of the window. Both young thugs and feckless scroungers would have a get-out. In Hereditary , Peter rails against the absence of responsibility. Annie offers an admission of guilt but immediately corrects herself: “I am blamed,” implicitly unfairly. Toni Collette: ‘I don’t like horror films – I’m too petrified’ No wonder, then, that genetic explanations for behaviour are so fiercely resisted on all sides. Evolutionary psychology and sociobiology are, for many, damnable blasphemies . When Larry Summers, the president of Harvard University, suggested that men outperform women in maths and sciences because of biological difference, he provoked such a furore that he was forced to apologise , before eventually resigning. Unfortunately, the evidence that inheritance plays a troublingly significant role in human life cannot be wished away as readily as might be hoped. No one denies that visible features, from red hair to Aunt Ethel nose, can be passed on. If physical characteristics, why not other traits? Annie suggestion that she inherited her stubbornness from her mother is hardly remarkable. If stubbornness, why not temper, recklessness, creativity, violence, stupidity or compassion? Boys choose to play with guns, and girls with dolls , before social influences have had a chance to mould their preferences. Hence the anxiety that Hereditary so cruelly exploits. Hollywood film-makers tend to allow the free human spirit to prevail in the end. Aster is not so obliging. He with Sophocles, which means that his message is grim. It is, however, far from unconvincing. Perhaps that why audiences seem to hate his film , in spite of its critical acclaim.",980,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/jun/18/evil-spirit-that-haunts-hereditary-is-gene-genie-ari-aster-genetic-curse
55,"Christopher Nolan made his first appearance at Cannes – and, in a Prestige -like twist, it was for a movie he didn’t make. The anniversary “unrestored” version of A Space Odyssey premieres here on Sunday, and a packed auditorium sat for over minutes to hear the Archbishop of Analogue discuss how this miracle revival came to be. Stanley Kubrick daughter Katharina was in the crowd, as was star Keir Dullea and Cannes jury member (and fellow Warner Bros auteur) Denis Villeneuve. Nolan father took him as a seven-year-old to a re-release of in in “the biggest theatre” in Leicester Square. “I have carried this experience with me ever since. I want to give a new generation the experience of sitting in awe,” the director said. The Dunkirk director is a soft and unhurried speaker, but his enthusiasm for colour grading, film stocks and projection equipment is borderline obsessive. While he acknowledged that those who choose to shoot on digital should certainly do so, it is evident that he thinks it the wrong choice. “Film is the best analogy for the way the eye sees. It is the most immersive, the most emotionally involving,” he argued. He had the opportunity to do side-by-side comparisons, and this was how this project originated. While at Warner Bros overseeing the transfer of his earlier work to the new home video format, surrounded by some of the projectors the studio had collected for their theatrical distribution of Dunkirk, Nolan spotted in storage a spare, picture-only reel from the first prints of Watching it got his juices flowing. The new version comes to cinemas as it did years ago, reproducing the photochemical processes based on the original lab notes and reproducing the six-speaker sound with no new interpretation. “Digitisation changes the medium,” says Nolan. “Digital is a fantastic tool for archives, but you need a photochemical backbone,” he continued. “We need it for the future of film. It is the only stable medium.” Having lobbed these cinephiliac bombs, he explained how his analogue attitude extends to other aspects of his film-making. On set, he’ll ask his department heads “how would you have done this before?” This means, for example, getting crafty with hiding wires, so as few as possible will need to be removed with computers. This allows as much as possible from the original analogue negative. Nolan claims this oftentimes ends up being cheaper, so he isn’t just being mad about film grain. He also went in on some studio directors who don’t shoot their own second unit photography – the industry term for insert shots, landscapes and other bits of business that don’t involve acting. “If it is important enough to be on screen, I should be the one to shoot it,” he stated with little pomposity. “The screen is the same size, even if the shot is small.” He also argued that cutaways, even of hands, should be the actor that playing the role, otherwise you miss a “level of a performer integration.” Looking back upon his CV, Nolan summed up The Dark Knight trilogy as a series of genre exercises defined by their villains. “Batman Begins is a hero journey, so Ra al Ghul as a mentor-enemy makes sense. The Dark Knight is a crime drama, with Joker as an agent of chaos or terrorist set loose in an urban environment. The Dark Knight Rises is a historical epic or war film, with Bane as a militaristic foe.” He added, however, that every one of his films has a film noir dynamic “judging the characters by what they do not by what they say.” Christopher Nolan films are always propulsive and engrossing, but a lengthy after-lunch chat translated back and forth into French isn’t, it must be said, quite as rousing. He did get a few laughs talking about his frequent writing partner (brother Jonathan Nolan) and producer (wife Emma Thomas). “Film noir draws on an exaggeration of our fears and desires. I work with people I can trust. I am clearly someone who is fearful of betrayal.”",676,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/may/12/christopher-nolan-at-cannes-i-want-the-young-to-sit-in-awe-at-2001-a-space-odyssey
56,"John Hurt had a constant companion on the set of That Good Night: a container of revolting-looking bright green vegetable juice which, he testified, tasted “bloody awful”. He chugged dutifully away on this throughout the shoot, forgoing his beloved fine wines in favour of something that might help the prognosis – for he had pancreatic cancer. In our film, John plays an ageing writer who is facing his own mortality following a similar diagnosis. He must have chosen the project with the parallels in mind, though he was not a man especially solemn about his remaining time on the planet – or, indeed, about anything. Yet he did confide to me that he felt unusually close to his character, a demanding and irascible man, desperate to reconnect with his family and make amends for past transgressions before it was too late. In the scenes between John and the actor who plays his son, I think that comes through: there a beauty and an honesty there that can feel quite painful. In production, John spent time with his own children: Sasha – a hard-working member of our art department – and Nick, who had a small acting role in a restaurant scene. His abundant pride in his two boys was evident and endearing. His gregarious manner and impish behaviour made time on and off set more pleasurable for everyone. When I went out for a meal with him and my own family just before shooting started, my two young sons weren’t impressed by me talking shop with a colleague, no matter how famous, and wanted to steer the conversation towards football. John was delighted by the opportunity to rave about the promotion to the Premier League of his beloved Norwich City. They were thrilled too: finally, a man who spoke their language. John sartorial elegance has been documented many times before, and neither his illness nor the heat of the Algarve sun put a cramp in his style. When I first met him, he was wearing a very dapper and incredibly loud paisley shirt. His hair had grown back after chemotherapy in quite a singular, spiky, unkempt manner that, as it happened, seemed perfect for his character. That said, he was concerned his beard – at that stage quite thin – might all fall out before filming. But he framed the concern with such a wry smile that we never quite took it seriously. As both a man and a performer, John lived in the moment. He was generous and present, listening with such quiet intensity to his fellow performers that filming always felt fresh and the results – I hope – vital. He reminded me of another legend I’ve been lucky enough to work with: Julie Andrews . Both were all you’d hope for and more: humble, tolerant, with a brilliant eye for detail and a compassion you’d never need to question. Sadly, the green juice didn’t repay its revoltingness, and John died before the film was complete. As we worked on the final edit, many scenes – and indeed specific lines of dialogue – acquired an awful new poignancy. “When you get old,” he tells Charles Dance character (a sort of dapper Grim Reaper), “you’re not afraid to die – more afraid that you won’t die in time.” I’d listen to his distinctive, mellifluous voice on the studio speakers – immensely thankful for my brief time with such a man, and immensely sad it was cut short.

57,"hen a film is set in London, it can often feel like the whole thing was directed by the tourist board. There’ll be an aerial shot of the London Eye. The Shard will glint in the background. There’ll be taxis by the bucketload. If you’re shooting Basic Instinct Risk Addiction, characters will attend aggressively sexualised therapy sessions right at the top of the Gherkin. It all very narrow and heavy on the landmarks. Sometimes the suburbs get a look-in, but not all of them. North and west London may have featured in everything from Shaun of the Dead to Bend It Like Beckham, and east London might have been used as a shorthand for grit in films like The Long Good Friday and Ill Manors. But south-east London rarely gets a mention. True, plenty of films are shot in south-east London – The Da Vinci Code had scenes shot at Biggin Hill airport; Johnny Depp Dark Shadows was partly filmed in Beckenham Place Park – but very few films are actually about south-east London. Film-makers, what has London ever done to you? This is why something like The Bromley Boys feels so refreshing. It hasn’t even been released yet but, simply by being about Bromley FC, it promises a glimpse at a London that passes the rest of the world by. Maybe a character will go running through the Glades shopping centre. Maybe they’ll get to register a death at the Civic Centre or ride around on the to Chestnut Avenue. Maybe the action will venture out as far as Chislehurst Caves, although technically they aren’t in Bromley proper and so any inclusion in The Bromley Boys will be an almighty slap in the face to all true Bromleians. But with so few movies dedicated to life in London forgotten corner, what can we learn about the area from the productions that actually went there? Let find out. Nil By Mouth Kidbrooke Ferrier Estate provided the backdrop for Gary Oldman punishing ode to relentless miserable violence, famed for containing the word “cunt” more than any other film in history. It less a tourism advert and more a dire warning for the rest of the world to permanently partition London off. However, film fans had better brace themselves for disappointment, because Ferrier Estate no longer exists. It since been replaced by the Kidbrooke Village development, where a one-bed flat now costs close to half a million pounds. If anyone ever makes a sequel to Nil By Mouth , there a good chance it’ll feature Ray Winstone petitioning the council to build a nice Waitrose or a pop-up small-batch candlestick retail installation. How to Talk to Girls at Parties Although poor Croydon is used in a lot of films – Delta Point became Gotham general hospital in The Dark Knight Rises , for example – not many films actually want to be about Croydon. But the Neil Gaiman adaptation How to Talk to Girls at Parties is both set and filmed there, and it features real-life locations such as the College Green, the multi-storey carpark near College Green and St George Walk shopping parade. Of course, it should be pointed out that Croydon is very obviously just a placeholder for miserable suburban nothingness, but Croydonites are probably already quite used to that. Treacle Jr There an enormous chance that you haven’t seen Jamie Thraves’ Treacle Jr , which came and went in the blink of an eye eight years ago. But it nevertheless worth seeking out, because you’d be hard pushed to find a prettier depiction of London hidden gems. There are scenes set in Peckham Rye Common and scenes set in West Dulwich, there Goose Green and Herne Hill and Walworth. Locals will be thrilled to see the distinctive Sainsbury car park on Dog Kennel Hill. Best of all, there a lovely sequence set in the Horniman Museum. All films should contain lovely sequences set in the Horniman Museum. Babylon Written by Quadrophenia Martin Stellman, Babylon, directed by Franco Rosso , is nothing less than south-east London Saturday Night Fever. Aswad Brindsley Forde plays a garage hand who lives for the Deptford sound system culture at night, encountering racism, violence and police brutality along the way. Again, it worth pointing out that Babylon was released years ago , and its depiction of south-east London has now become completely unrecognisable. For example, a Time Out list from entitled Reasons to Visit Deptford High Street had in first place an Instagram of some nice cocktails sold by a Jamaican-themed bar. I’m sure the guy from Aswad would be thrilled. Harry Brown Imagine if Michael Caine had survived the end of Get Carter, then slowly went a bit cantankerous on a Walworth housing estate. Got it? Great, because that means you never have to watch Harry Brown, in which Michael Caine vigilante-murders a load of men in hoodies as brutally as he can. Again – and I realise that this is becoming something of a theme here – Harry Brown was filmed on an estate that no longer exists. It has since been redeveloped into something called Elephant Park where, like Kidbrooke Village, a one-bedroom apartment will cost you half a million quid. Thor The Dark World The lousiest Marvel movie featured several key scenes set in south-east London. Coincidence? We may never know. However, if you enjoy seeing famous landmarks getting blown to smithereens, this is the film for you. The Greenwich Old Royal Naval College gets the absolute hell beaten out of it at the climax of this film. In fact, the destruction was so comprehensive that developers have now transformed the site into a luxury housing scheme called Navy Halls, where a dot-sized one-bedroom apartment will now cost you three times more than you will ever earn in your entire life. It the south-east London way, after all.",977,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/may/07/south-east-london-nil-by-mouth-bromley-boys-thor-2-six

59,"Sign up to our Film Today email Vittorio Taviani, together with his brother Paolo who now survives him, pursued a vocation of cinema that was deeply bound up with the Italian landscape: the hills of Tuscany where the brothers were born, and those of Sicily and Sardinia. The lush countryside is a vital and sensuous presence in the Tavianis’ work, and yet it is unsentimentally also seen as the site of cruel agricultural labour and even as a kind of prison. In their films, the land is a counterpoint to humanity trials, dramas and absurdities, which they often put in ensemble and anthologised form, perhaps to get a larger perspective on individual stories. It wasn’t just a matter of quietism and contemplation. The brothers were also deeply engaged with Marxist and Brechtian thinking, a sensibility that persisted right up to their award-winning movie Caesar Must Die . They were looking for radical, challenging ways to present human life; a mode which alternated with more naturalistic and also more dreamlike or symbolic modes of storytelling, often derived from literary adaptations of authors such as Pirandello, Boccaccio and Goethe. Their creative high-water mark was the masterly Padre Padrone from an inspired adaptation of a memoir of Sardinian childhood by the scholar Gavino Ledda, who appeared in the film as the narrator, and directed a quasi-sequel called Ybris in The title (in English: Father and Master) is interestingly Tolstoyan, and the brothers also had a lifelong interest in adapting Tolstoy work. Padre Padrone is an extraordinary film about a Sardinian peasant boy who rebels against his father insistence that he should grow up to be nothing more than a shepherd. On turning he is effectively rescued from a life of rural illiteracy and misery by – of all things – national service. In the army he learns about electronics and literature, and on his return he demands to go to university. He has is a painful, angry break with his father in consequence. There is no rosy-hued romanticising of the shepherd life here: it is seen as a brutal, soul-crushing confinement, and it is the army (that traditional symbol of conformity and brutality) that provides the young artist first means of escape. Brilliantly, the Tavianis turned every cliche on its head. Ledda achieved a kind of miraculous social and intellectual transcendence, away from the soil, while at the same time preserving a spiritual connection with it, studying and memorialising its language and culture in the academic sense, and so gaining a perspective and understanding not permitted to those left behind. It was also a miraculous kind of transcendence for the Tavianis: a way of responding to the soil, the landscape, the agricultural working class, the struggle, the escape, ideology and analysis – everything fused satisfyingly into one. Padre Padrone was the film that won the brothers the Palme D’Or at Cannes; juror Pauline Kael reported afterwards that everyone was convinced that it had to win, due largely to the advocacy of jury president Roberto Rossellini , who harangued everyone with such passion that it may have contributed to the heart attack that killed him a few weeks later. The Tavianis had earlier made their breakthrough with The Subversives in an anthology-style film with something of Francesco Rosi , about various people reaction to the death of communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, whose funeral is shown in genuine news footage. Under the Sign of Scorpio is a strange, Pirandellian film about a crowd of people evacuated from an island to the mainland after a volcanic eruption and having to renegotiate, on this tabula rasa, the nature of their politics and society. St Michael Had a Rooster is the Tavianis’ pessimistic and disillusioned adaptation of Tolstoy story The Divine and the Human, about an aristocrat revolutionary sentenced to years’ solitary confinement, from which he emerges to find that the radical ideals for which he has sacrificed his freedom and most of his sanity have been mostly forgotten about. The Tavianis’ later film Night Sun was another Tolstoy adaptation, transferring his story Father Sergius to an Italian setting, with Julian Sands as a disaffected nobleman who retreats into a priestly hermit existence after his discovering his fiancee is having an affair with the king. The brothers also adapted Tolstoy Resurrection for television in Their political drama Allonsanfàn is an equally Tolstoyan work, although it isn’t an adaptation. It stars Marcello Mastroianni as an Italian aristocrat turned radical who winds up selling out his comrades, but in a twist of fate endures a kind of chaotic and accidental martyrdom for the cause. Paolo and Vittorio Taviani: 'For us it was cinema or death' After the triumph of Padre Padrone, the Tavianis enjoyed modest success with their highly cerebral and verbose Tuscan love-triangle The Meadow with Isabella Rossellini. But audiences and critics were charmed by the more sentimental and even sugary wartime-nostalgist drama The Night of San Lorenzo (or The Night of Shooting Stars), in It is set in August with Italy under German occupation. The Nazis are retreating northward before the allies’ advance and have brusquely informed the locals that they are blowing up buildings, but that the cathedral is a safe haven. Instead of sheltering there, a group of people venture south to greet the American liberators, and the film is a slightly whimsical anthology of their quaintly imagined experiences. Here, the Tavianis tapped into a streak of treacly picturesque in Italian cinema, which has traditionally gone over well abroad – comparable to films such as Cinema Paradiso and Life Is Beautiful . It was a prizewinner for them, but perhaps not typical. Kaos an adaptation of four tales by Pirandello, is probably a more successful example of the same type of flight of fancy. The brothers had a late and startling flowering with the docudrama Caesar Must Die, a Golden Bear winner at the Berlin film festival in – a back-to-basics movie about power, politics and ideology. I found it fascinating if flawed at the time, but there is no doubt about its energy and authenticity. It was a fierce return to the passions that first drove them in the It could be that Caesar Must Die and Padre Padrone will be their two monuments.",1039,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/16/paolo-and-vittorio-taviani-radical-italian-padre-padrone
60,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest director Miloš Forman dies aged The divine inspiration of madness – its ambiguity, its creativity, its higher sanity, and the cover and legitimacy it gives to protest against oppression and bullies of all stripes – these were the ideas which energised Miloš Forman in his remarkable work. He was the Czech new wave émigré who brought the spirit of anti-Soviet rebellion to Hollywood and made its sly comic strategies and humanist passion flower in dozens of different ways. He also became one of the many directors whose work was shaped by working with the great screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière. Forman was a sensational Oscar winner with One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest starring Jack Nicholson as the hyperactive crook who fakes madness to get what he thinks is the soft option of a psychiatric facility; and Amadeus the gripping myth about F Murray Abraham thin-lipped Antonio Salieri planning to kill Tom Hulce impish Mozart – the mediocre rational careerist enviously destroying the disorderly genius. Forman became feted for conjuring drama and star performances from the bristling ensemble of smaller roles. And the madhouse scene, in all its poignant farce and Foucauldian political surveillance became a keynote of his movies, even resurfacing in his final, flawed work Goya Ghosts in with Natalie Portman, Javier Bardem and Stellan Skårsgard. Forman studied screenwriting at the Academy of the Performing Arts in Prague and his first big success was A Blonde in Love which, like so much in pop culture from the west, tapped into the romantic and erotic dissatisfaction, as well as the social restlessness, of the young. A young woman who works in a shoe factory has a one-night stand with a guy, but on moving to the big city to be with him, and on crucially meeting his parents (that unsatisfactory older generation) sees that there is something very wrong. His next big hit was the sensational – but interestingly subtle and indirect – satire The Firemen Ball in a virtual real-time account of an evening fundraiser for the local fire service in which bureaucracy and pompous uniform-wearing officialdom are sent up. Importantly, a building actually burns to the ground in the course of a night dedicated to firefighting. It is a brilliant and persuasive comedy. But it was banned by the Czech authorities, a paradoxical act of important criticism which revealed the film and Forman importance, and their own hamfisted clumsiness. After the tanks were sent into Prague, Forman established himself in New York. His comedy Taking Off touched again on the theme of the stuffy and now preposterous older generation failing to understand their children, but it was his movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest which propelled Forman into the big league. This was based on the Ken Kesey novel which had already been adapted for the stage with Kirk Douglas in the lead role. With the help of his producer son Michael Douglas, Kirk was persuaded to step down in favour of the hot newcomer Jack Nicholson and under Forman guidance, his boisterous performance amidst the gallery of holy fools and other unholy people was electric. It was a brilliant film, though still perhaps not entirely understood: Forman directed a great scene in which the hated Nurse Ratched reveals herself to be not driven by sadism but a kind of blinkered, misguided professionalism. Forman protégé James Mangold drew on the master work for his own film Girl, Interrupted, with Angelina Jolie in the comparable sacrificial-wild-child role. Hair was Forman next movie, a screen adaptation of the counter-culture anti-war musical which made protest acceptable to the theatregoing classes. It was another example of how Forman had a flair for the zeitgeist and for artistic dissent, but it perhaps didn’t quite approximate the impact Hair had had on stage: a theatre work which itself looks a little genteel compared to the rock legends of the time. But his movie was a very intelligent, fluent piece of work. Amadeus was Forman next theatrical adaptation — and again the actor who had made the lead role a hit on stage had to be persuaded to step aside. This was the brilliant Simon Callow, who perhaps deserved a chance to be directed by Forman and it is a shame that his performance was not immortalised on screen. But Tom Hulce, with his sudden, shriekingly nervous and trumphant laugh, was still a very successful Mozart and F Murray Abraham was horribly malcontented as Salieri, and chillingly convincing as someone who foresees his own destiny in hell. Amadeus is less renowned than Cuckoo Nest among Forman work, but in some ways it hangs together better. And it really is, to use a critical platitude often given to more solemn work, “mesmerising”. It was ideal for Forman own sophistication and his real, lived experience of art and the authorities: how the agencies of the state, in all their stultifying pomposity, will claim to be patrons or sponsors of the arts, but only to spread the word of conformism, to assist in the business of controlling people hearts and minds, and in doing so create malign mediocrity. Perhaps Forman saw a battalion of Salieris in Czechoslovakia and all over Eastern Europe, blandly consenting to a soulless regime in return for petty distinctions. In his later career, Forman directed Valmont, an adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, a movie which was perhaps more obviously passionate and erotic than Stephen Frears Dangerous Liaisons which had come out the year before — but which upstaged Forman version, with its colossal performances from Glenn Close and John Malkovich. Forman was to address two more classic American bad boys: the porn publisher Larry Flynt and the cult comic Andy Kaufman. In The People Vs Larry Flynt Woody Harrelson impulsive and extravagant Flynt becomes a highly unlikely and satirically ambiguous poster boy for freedom of speech. In Man on the Moon Jim Carrey plays Kaufman as the rock-n-roll wild man of standup. Forman never quite solved the problem of whether and how the film was allowed to be funny on its own account, but it was great casting and Forman clearly empathised with the comedian and his lonely, courageous artform. Forman was a fascinating and triumphant century artist — his career was a carnival subversion of tyrannies.",1049,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/14/milos-forman-the-director-who-brought-the-spirit-of-anti-soviet-rebellion-to-hollywood
61,"From his clean-cut good looks to his inner angst, the titular character in Love, Simon seems like your average American high school movie hero. Except for one thing: he secretly gay. The story of Simon journey out of the closet drives this sweet, funny and in many ways conventional teen comedy-drama that doing brisk business in the States. Love, Simon review – heartwarming gay romance What more, Love, Simon is produced by Century Fox, which makes it the first major studio teen movie with a gay hero. While arthouse and LGBT cinema have long explored the coming out story, queer characters have been minor players in films such as Mean Girls and Clueless . Indie comedies But I’m a Cheerleader and GBF put LGBT characters at the centre, but in the studio movie playground, the words gay and lesbian are insults spat out by prom queens and jocks. Occasionally, the butt of their joke is actually gay, such as Les in Bring It On But often this is directed at our straight hero or heroine, who must have a makeover and prove their heterosexuality in order to gain acceptance from both peers and audience. “When mainstream teen movies began to incorporate LGBT characters more regularly in the they almost always came in the form of wisecracking cis men,” says Charlie Lyne, director of Beyond Clueless , a documentary on the satirical teen comedy. “And even then, they were routinely sidelined and desexualised, as in the case of Damian from Mean Girls, who we’re told is ‘too gay to function’, but who never once expresses any attraction to other men. They’re often great characters in other ways but they’re deeply limited.” Based on the novel by Becky Albertalli, Love, Simon bucks many of these trends. Simon (Nick Robinson) is a well-rounded character whose sexuality is only part of his identity – and whose makeover is heading in a completely different direction. Also, he not alone in high school. Along with the jocks, nerds and cheerleaders, there one openly gay student, as well as at least two in the closet: Simon hesitant online flirtation with an anonymous pupil keeps the audience guessing. “The treatment of LGBT issues in teen cinema has definitely progressed in line with wider cultural attitudes,” Lyne adds. “If anything, teen movies have typically been a few years behind actual teenagers, who are usually among the earliest in society to sense a changing social tide. As recently as the early while queer teenagers built vast online communities at the very heart of mainstream platforms such as YouTube, teen movies continued to relegate LGBT characters to the sidelines.” Compared to cinema, television has been much quicker to catch up, notes Russell T Davies, who brought a gay teen to Channel in Queer As Folk “The brilliant gay teen in My So-Called Life was years ago,” he notes. Davies says that Love, Simon director has championed gay characters in many TV shows, from Dawson Creek to The Flash : “Greg Berlanti is a TV man through and through. He got acres of successful gay stories behind him. To see him bringing that into the multiplexes is a glorious victory.” So why has it taken film so long to catch up? The answer, says Davies, is simple. “It our old friend, that lumbering beast, the white, straight man. But it comes down to money in the end. Television can be more nimble because it cheaper: you’re looking at roughly for an hour of drama. But if a movie costs, say, then there times the caution, more levels of bankers being scared, times the arguments. Thirty more idiots, in the end. And if you increase the sums, if you go up to blockbusters costing then you have a hundred times the fear. That why a vast empire like the Marvel Cinematic Universe is devoid of gay characters. And that why Pixar has only managed the horrific camp of the Ken Doll in Toy Story The money men need only look to recent awards seasons to see that gay stories have wide appeal. Moonlight, God Own Country and Call Me By Your Name featured young gay characters who have become beloved by audiences beyond the LGBT demographic, winning Oscar-nominated Call My By Your Name star Timothée Chalamet a wealth of obsessive female fans. Combined with Love, Simon success, does this add up to a brighter future for high school movies with gay leads? Director Joe Stephenson ( Chicken , McKellen: Playing the Part) isn’t sure. “Love, Simon is an anomaly in that it is receiving the support of a studio, and I’m sceptical about whether its success will trigger a wave of support from others on stories centred on gay characters. There remains a fear that a film centred on a gay character will be classed as a ‘gay film’, only of interest to gay people. People hoped a change would come with Brokeback Mountain but here we are years later, asking if the change will come again.” Davies is similarly cautious. “I think we should be very careful if we imagine these changes are permanent. It been almost years since Queer As Folk but still, every time I write a gay character, someone somewhere complains, and someone somewhere says, ‘This is new!’ It not one battle, it a constant fight.” And the fight isn’t just about representation, but narrative. Says Stephenson, “My hope is that gay characters can finally start existing in mainstream films without their sexuality being the key character trait. Straight people in mainstream films don’t have to deal with their sexuality constantly, neither does their sexuality have to be a ‘reveal’. How nice it would be for a character to be gay and it be of no consequence to the plot or their mental health at all.”",967,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/10/love-simon-russell-t-davies-and-more-on-why-the-gay-teen-movie-is-a-glorious-victory
62,"These are hard times for Ben Affleck, what with everyone snarking about his tummy and his tattoo and the general manner in which he greets each day with a bone-deep, mournful billion-yard stare. Times are so hard that every positive should be clung to, no matter how minuscule. So here a minuscule positive: it has been announced that Affleck film The Accountant was the most rented movie of in the US. More people rented The Accountant than Moana. More people rented The Accountant than Beauty and the Beast. More people rented it than Rogue One, Wonder Woman and Guardians of the Galaxy Sure, The Accountant only scraped in at place in digital purchases . If we’re talking physical sales (ie DVDs), it didn’t even crack the top But digital rentals – the cheap, muddy middle ground between “There is no way in hell I’d ever watch this at the cinema” and “I don’t want to wait three years until this turns up on Netflix for free” – is where The Accountant can finally shine. You’ll notice, of course, that The Accountant is not a good film. It isn’t even a particularly memorable one. Starring Affleck as a man with autism and a machine gun, it opened on a quiet weekend in October – its meagre competition included Kevin Hart: What Now? and a Harry Potter Imax marathon – gained a middling on Rotten Tomatoes and then quickly dropped out of sight. And yet here we are. A year and a half later and The Accountant is so much of a hit that Warner Bros are developing a sequel. But The Accountant is not alone. Dig around enough and plenty of other mostly forgotten films begin to stand out as stealth hits. Despite being a repository for some of the finest feature films ever made, back in Netflix revealed that its most-watched movie of all time was The Ridiculous , an Adam Sandler Netflix-exclusive western spoof most notable for looking like the sort of thing you’d watch if you found Grown Ups a little too highbrow. Late last year, kiosk-based rental service Redbox revealed its most-rented movies of all time. And, although the number one film – The Hunger Games – was a genuine hit, number three was revealed to be Identity Thief . You know, Identity Thief; the film where Melissa McCarthy does something and then pulls a face and then it ends. You know, it that film you literally haven’t thought about once since before it even came out, unless you’re really into Redbox. Even weirder, in a year when it invested heavily in prestigious fare such as Manchester by the Sea, the most streamed film on the Amazon Prime Video service in Canada last year was Wanted , a solidly mediocre decade-old Angelina Jolie action film that most people now remember for its nightmarishly Photoshopped poster . Not that this is an entirely bad phenomenon. Quite often decent films will flop theatrically, only to find their natural audience in the home entertainment market. Dredd is a perfect case in point. Much better than the Sylvester Stallone movie that preceded it – and a remake of The Raid in all but name – it failed to recoup its budget in cinemas, before effortlessly racking up in DVD sales . Idiocracy, Mike Judge far-fetched fantasy movie about the dystopia created when a lowbrow celebrity is elected president, made times more in DVD rentals than it ever did theatrically . Showgirls, written off as tacky and schlocky at original time of release, is now reportedly the biggest-selling MGM DVD of all time . True, the success of some of these films seems truly inexplicable, but this is heartening nonetheless. It a feelgood story. Yes, your dumbly generic Melissa McCarthy vehicle or bland Affleck project might initially be met with a shrug, but give it a second chance and it could finally achieve the attention it deserves. Listen, if they can make a third Johnny English film , anything is possible.",669,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/09/film-flop-most-rented-ben-affleck-the-accountant
63,"The first trailer for The Man Who Killed Don Quixote has finally been released, years after director Terry Gilliam long-gestating film first went into production. Adapted from Cervantes’ “unfilmable” novel Don Quixote, Gilliam film has become one of the most famous examples of “development hell”. The former Monty Python man has attempted to make the film on eight occasions – most notably in when flash floods, Nato plane flyovers and a prostate infection that struck actor Jean Rochefort ( who died last October ) disrupted filming of a Johnny Depp-starring effort. That troubled production was the subject of a documentary, Lost in La Mancha. Though Gilliam had continued to press forward with production of Don Quixote in the years since, it was assumed by many to be a quixotic quest. That was until last June when Gilliam announced that he had managed to acquire funding for the film and found new leads in the shape of Jonathan Pryce as a deluded man who believes himself to be Quixote and Adam Driver as an advertising executive who Pryce character believes is his sidekick, Sancho Panza. After years, has Terry Gilliam finally broken the curse of Don Quixote? Now comes our first glimpse at Gilliam long-awaited work, with a teaser trailer that shows Pryce attempting to restore the lost age of chivalry as Quixote – and, inevitably, tilting at a few windmills along the way. The trailer also confirms that the film will skip between the present day and the century, with modern trappings seen alongside period detail. Yet even the release of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote trailer doesn’t necessarily mean this most protracted of movie sagas has come to an end, with France Inter reporting ( via the Playlist ) that one of the film former producers, Paulo Branco, is seeking to delay its release. Branco claims to have signed a contract in that would see him provide backing for Quixote and in return receive rights for the film. When that money wasn’t forthcoming, Gilliam found other producers to provide backing. However, Branco claims the contract he signed with Gilliam is still valid, meaning that the film cannot be released without Branco permission. The dispute is currently the subject of a court case, with a judgment due to be delivered in June, meaning Gilliam film will not be permitted to receive its planned premiere at May Cannes film festival. It another bump in the long road for this most troubled of productions, though given the director has waited nearly two decades to see his magnum opus on screen, he can stand to hold on for a few more months.",440,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/05/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-trailer-terry-gilliam
64,"o you want to see something really scary …” The horror anthology movie is a peculiar – some might think – imperfect beast. It been with us for well over years and is close to the heart of many fans, not least my own. In fact, it was one of the key influences on Ghost Stories, which I co-wrote and co-directed with Andy Nyman. But what makes these pictures so endlessly fascinating and appealing? Though there are examples from all over the world, this body rests on two sturdy British legs. One is the Ealing horror film Dead of Night , released in the other is the output of a small UK-based studio called Amicus , who were active throughout the and The Ealing film was more obviously artistic and noble in its intention, while the Amicus titles were – on the surface at least – more shamelessly commercial. And the tussle between those two impulses gives us a big clue as to the enduring appeal of these curious films. Ghost Stories review – Martin Freeman and Paul Whitehouse shine in dreamlike spookfest Anthology movies, sometimes known as portmanteau films, predate Dead of Night of course. Hollywood had produced a couple of notable successes in the early In Century Fox released Tales of Manhattan , an all-star, multi-story piece about a tailcoat that is passed from one owner to another, while the following year saw Universal Flesh and Fantasy , which had a vaguely supernatural air without ever touching on anything horrific. Both films were inspired by the French movie Un Carnet de Bal directed by Julien Duvivier, who was then hired to work on Flesh and Fantasy. Ealing Studios picked up the baton in with The Halfway House , another quasi-supernatural drama in which a miscellaneous group of people find themselves at a mysterious Welsh hotel – unaware it was destroyed by a bomb the previous year. Its success persuaded Ealing boss Michael Balcon to make another film in the same vein the following year. Reflecting on it in his autobiography, Balcon said: “We decided it would be a good idea to make a series of ghost stories joined by a suitable central thread, which would display the all-round talents of the creative team we had built up.” And it fair to say they had quite a team. Dead of Night has four directors: Basil Dearden, Charles Crichton, Alberto Cavalcanti and Robert Hamer. Cavalcanti was a feted documentary-maker who had also made the wartime classic Went the Day Well? ; Crichton would go on to direct The Lavender Hill Mob and A Fish Called Wanda ; Hamer would helm the brilliant Kind Hearts and Coronets , and Dearden gave us The Blue Lamp and The League of Gentlemen (the black-comedy thriller from which a certain comedy group thieved their name). The stories in Dead of Night were a combination of adaptations (two from EF Benson , one from HG Wells ) and original stories by Ealing staff writers. One of these, the through-line story that binds the others together, is Dead of Night secret weapon: it the best of the lot. An anxious architect (brilliantly played by an increasingly sweaty Mervyn Johns) is troubled by recurring dreams. His wife recommends he take up an invitation to a country house – only for him to get there and be hit by a terrible sense of deja vu. In an attempt to calm him down, the other guests tell him stories of their own supernatural experiences. But each time we come back to him, things get weirder and weirder. Dead of Night still packs a wallop. There is a third element to the film success: it was made by lovers of horror. Cavalcanti in particular was a huge admirer of Val Lewton groundbreaking B pictures being produced for RKO at the time – literate supernatural fantasies that relied on suggestion and atmosphere for their scares. Dead of Night was a moderate success on its release, but it didn’t lead to any revolution in movie-making in the UK. No particular strand of intelligent, well-made supernatural horror films appeared in its wake. In fact, Dead of Night real impact was not to be felt for another two decades. Amicus was famously a studio without walls, cobbling together productions on a film-by-film basis. It was founded by two New Yorkers of contrasting temperaments, dynamic grifter Max J Rosenberg and bookish scriptwriter Milton Subotsky, who were drawn to the UK by the Eady Levy, a government sponsored film production scheme. (Matt Hancock, take note.) Their first movie, Dr Terror House of Horrors just happened to be a portmanteau horror film. As well as Dead of Night, it was inspired by the recent success of the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation Tales of Terror and Black Sabbath (adaptations of Chekhov and Tolstoy). Dr Terror had to make do with Subotsky as its writer, but this was no bad thing. Subotsky was a massive fan of the genre and had a deep love of SF and horror, yet it was Rosenberg business smarts that lit the fuse. He realised that an anthology had a cost advantage: a conventional narrative required actors to be booked for several weeks of production and paid accordingly, but each individual story could be shot in a few days. This meant Amicus could afford to punch well above its weight, attracting big marquee turns with a reasonable daily rate, then have their names on the poster to market the movie for a fraction of what it would normally cost to employ them. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were snared in this way, and later productions would boast the likes of Jack Palance, Herbert Lom, David Warner and Donald Pleasence. This ethos extended behind the camera, and Subotsky and Rosenberg thought big when it came to creative talent. Dr Terror director Freddie Francis was an A-list cinematographer who had shot Room at the Top, Sons and Lovers and Innocents. Roy Ward Baker was an industry veteran who’d made the original Titanic drama A Night to Remember. New talent would also be promoted – such as Kevin Connor, a gifted visual stylist who was still in his when he directed From Beyond the Grave . Crucially, the films were made with love and care. If the budgets were low, the aspirations were high, and this attitude paid off on screen. Amicus were also enterprising in their source material, turning to Psycho author Robert Bloch for Torture Garden , British ghost story writer Ronald Chetwynd-Hayes for From Beyond the Grave, and in a particular stroke of genius the infamous EC horror comics of the for Tales from the Crypt and The Vault of Horror . By the cycle ground to a halt – along with the rest of the British film industry – after a productive decade. Subotsky attempted a revival with The Monster Club but the old magic was gone. However, the work done lingered in the imagination of a generation of genre fans, and the form became a fixture that is still with us today. The saw Creepshow, Twilight Zone: The Movie, Cat Eye and VHS-only gem Screamtime. In the we got Tales from the Darkside: The Movie, Body Bag and Tales from the Hood. And it still going strong with the V/H/S/ franchise , The ABCs of Death and the soon to be released The Field Guide to Evil. And the secret of their enduring appeal? For me it two-fold. It partly to do with that fusion of the highbrow and lowbrow in the best examples of the anthology horror, which is deeply entertaining. But there something older, too, something primal lurking in there, a connection to our most ancient form of storytelling. There an atavistic yearning deep inside us to be back round that flickering fire, keeping the terrors of the night at bay, as the yarn-spinner holds us bewitched: “You liked that one? Well, I’ve got another for you – but be warned, this one is really scary …” Ghost Stories is released on April.",1343,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/05/horror-anthology-films-ghost-stories-jeremy-dyson
65,"In a issue of the Fantastic Four comics, the awesome foursome successfully defeat the nefarious Super-Skrull (who had a combination of all the team superpowers) by blocking an energy beam from the alien home planet. Perhaps Marvel was inspired by the move in when it cancelled the original comic book series just as rival film studio Century Fox was set to release its doomed Fantastic Four reboot on the big screen. The cancellation, you might say, effectively blocked any much-needed publicity Fox film-makers had hoped for. Marvel move was sparked, according to more recent reports , by Fox determination to retain rights to Fantastic Four (and the X-Men) provided it continued to release new films. But Marvel was getting nowhere in its negotiations to try to bring the titles back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As retaliation against Fox, it allegedly decided to write Reed Richards and his team out of the picture in print. To the casual onlooker, it appeared as if the Fantastic Four were simply unworthy of retaining their own title (a sense confirmed by anyone who has had to sit through Josh Trank insipid movie – or indeed any of its Fox-produced predecessors ). Fast forward to the picture looks very different. Marvel parent company Disney is in the process of buying Century Fox , which will likely bring the latter studio superhero movie rights back into the fold. If the Fantastic Four are finally introduced into the MCU, where will Marvel chief Kevin Feige and his team take the quartet? Given how much fun writers are having in the cosmic corners of the Marvel universe with episodes such as Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy it would make sense to reimagine Reed and his team as the connection between mankind and alien races such as the Kree and the Skrull, just as they have been in the comics for decades. This is an area the Fox movies have barely touched upon, beyond the inclusion of the Silver Surfer and (briefly) Galactus in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. We know that Marvel is at long last introducing the shapeshifting Skrull in next year Captain Marvel , which will begin setting up the comics’ famous Kree-Skrull war storyline. That arc saw the Earth become a battleground for the two alien races, with the Fantastic Four and the Avengers charged with defending mankind from the extraterrestrial threat. As the MCU heads into its fourth phase, following the events of this year Avengers: Infinity War and its untitled sequel, Reed team could find themselves right at the centre of the Marvel universe. Casting could be key if the Fantastic Four do finally return to the MCU. There has been wild speculation by fans this week that actor-spouses John Krasinski and Emily Blunt might end up playing Reed Richards and Sue Storm , AKA the Invisible Woman. While Blunt appointment would be a coup, Krasinski is a long way from the kind of marquee movie star to mark Mister Fantastic arrival in the MCU as momentous. In addition to being stretchy as all hell, Reed is one of the world brightest mind and needs to be played by an actor with gravitas, one who can stand with Robert Downey Jr Tony Stark and Benedict Cumberbatch Doctor Strange atop the central plinths of the Marvel pantheon. At least by the time Reed et al do come home, it looks as if they will also have regained their place in the comics. Last week, Marvel confirmed that the Fantastic Four are going back into print with a new ongoing series being published from August. After a long time out in the cold, it as if the famed quartet have finally taken the first step to getting their powers back.",630,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/05/marvel-fantastic-four-fox-disney
66,"In the century, the Japanese scholar Motoori Norinaga coined a valuable phrase. Mono no aware roughly translates to a sense of impermanence, or nostalgia for something you haven’t yet lost. When I watch my favourite films from the it a feeling that resonates with me. In its fourth decade, the cinema was no longer a novelty art form: it was ready to reach for greatness. The saw plenty of the experimentation that had filled the and but also a growing refinement of cinema universal language: sophistication in camera and editing technique, more naturalistic performances, increasing narrative ambition. The films made in the look like the best of what we watch today, with one quiet difference. Even as the silent cinema was hitting its famous peaks, from Battleship Potemkin to The Passion of Joan of Arc to The Last Laugh, Napoléon and Pandora Box , the dogs were snapping at its heels. By the end of the decade, the coming of sound would change everything. The Jazz Singer debuted synchronised speech and music in autumn but it took time for change to sweep through the whole industry (in Japan, it took even longer). When it did, for a short period cinema largely reverted to a static, stilted art form while film-makers became accustomed to the new technology and its early limitations, while studios distanced themselves from their mute archive. When the first histories of the silent era were written, the period was passed off as an embarrassment, and the vast contribution of women to cinema in this decade barely mentioned. Now, with an estimated of silent cinema considered lost, part of the pleasure we get from watching films from the roaring twenties is realising that their age has passed and that we’re lucky to be able to see them at all. Slapstick comedians exploited fattened budgets to transform their gag routines into feature-length classics The is the first era in which America dominated the global film market, newly centred in Hollywood, developing a studios-and-stars system that would flourish for decades to come. Slapstick comedians exploited fattened budgets to transform their gag routines into feature-length classics infused with emotion, beginning with Chaplin The Kid in (though The Circus is my personal favourite), through to Buster Keaton deadly civil war chase The General and Harold Lloyd show-stopping climb in Safety Last! While Hollywood then, as now, put a lot of its effort into flashy genre pictures – swashbucklers, westerns, costume dramas and war films – the best movies of this era are more subdued. In the Hollywood excelled at the melodrama and the romance – many written by the great female screenwriters of the including Frances Marion and June Mathis. Frank Borzage , Clarence Brown, King Vidor and Josef von Sternberg directed great films about ordinary people disillusioned with the world but falling in love with each other, while Ernst Lubitsch did the same thing but extra sex and humour. Many of these pictures were brightened by the presence of a new set of camera-natural stars: Mary Pickford , John Barrymore, Greta Garbo , Clara Bow , Lillian Gish , John Gilbert, Pola Negri , Janet Gaynor , Charles Farrell and the inimitable smoulderer Rudolph Valentino . Many of them came from Europe, where cinema was an even livelier art – in fact it was pretty wild in the Famously, the Germans found a new outlet for postwar angst in the extreme stylisation and psychological gloom of expressionism, with film-makers such as FW Murnau and Fritz Lang reinterpreted that mode with masterpieces such as Nosferatu , Faust, Dr Mabuse: The Gambler and Metropolis . Then the street films of the New Objectivity, especially those by GW Pabst and Gerhard Lamprecht, trained the camera unflinchingly on the horrors only suggested by the expressionists, opening up a new vision of realism. Scandinavia experienced its own golden age, with the Dane Carl Theodor Dreyer making several exquisite silents across Europe, while in Sweden, Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sjöström created powerfully heartbreaking dramas about love and loss that seemed to belong to a previous century, despite their beautiful technique. In the new Soviet Union, government support of cinema combined with the radicalism of artists such as Sergei Eisenstein , Vsevolod Pudovkin and Aleksandr Dovzhenko to transform the pacy edits of Hollywood into a frenetic deconstruction of the cinema, and of society itself. The films they made belong fiercely to their era and agenda, but they’re also strangely timeless, still blazing with the energy of modernity. From The Wizard of Oz to Top Hat – why the is my favourite film decade The aspirations of French film-makers soared with the impressionistic epics of Abel Gance and the ornate art pieces of Marcel L’Herbier . In Britain, meanwhile, a faltering industry produced some underappreciated classics in the first half of the decade before a group of cinephile tyros marched into to inject the best of continental and Soviet cinema into a clutch of brilliant silents – among them a youth called Alfred Hitchcock, whose Blackmail , The Lodger and The Manxman rank among the finest work in his long career. The then, is my favourite cinema decade, and the only one that for me seems to be self-contained – as if a parallel version of the medium we know today flourished and died in just years.

67,"First, the bad news. The found Hitchcock and Lean waning, Michael Powell a pariah and Pasolini beaten to death . Disaster movies were falling from the skies. Jaws and Star Wars gave birth to the modern blockbuster, bestowing undue weight for ever on the words “opening weekend”. In Britain, the mackintoshed masses made mega-hits out of the Confessions and Adventures sex comedies. The dismal softcore romp Come Play With Me ran for four years straight. As for the good news – well, where to start? Primed by countercultural successes such as Last Year at Marienbad and Bonnie and Clyde , audiences were ripe for a challenge. They were well placed, for instance, to decipher the enigmas of Don’t Look Now , released in the UK in in a double-chill-bill with The Wicker Man . In the same year, Lindsay Anderson made O Lucky Man!, the most richly ambitious British film since the heyday of Powell and Pressburger. Albert Finney, keen to use his clout and cash to back daring outsiders, had helped finance Anderson If… , and he came through again for two up-and-comers: Stephen Frears, who made his debut with Gumshoe, starring Finney as a bingo-caller with delusions of Bogart, and Mike Leigh, whose Bleak Moments created a new kind of comedy measured out in squirms and winces. Frears and Leigh didn’t return to cinema until the but the was where their film-making began. Even the studios embraced the spirit of experimentation, bankrolling daredevil projects such as Chinatown , Taxi Driver and The Godfather ; Terrence Malick, an arthouse genius on the corporate dime, pocketed a no-strings stipend from Paramount. US cinema enduring maverick, Robert Altman, dissected the damaged American psyche in the monumental Nashville . Black lives mattered, long before #BlackLivesMatter, in Killer of Sheep and Sweet Sweetback Baadasssss Song . Elaine May acidic comedies (A New Leaf, The Heartbreak Kid) peeled the comforts from the romcom genre like a sadistic child plucking the wings off flies. There was affection as well as iconoclasm, as proved by Peter Bogdanovich sparkling homages to old Hollywood, such as The Last Picture Show and What Up, Doc? Any overview of the decade tends to be monopolised by the US new wave, not least because its directors (Lucas, Scorsese, Spielberg) would dominate cinema for the rest of the century, but there was dynamism everywhere. Ousmane Sembène made his masterpiece, the mischievous Xala , and his fellow Senegalese visionary Djibril Diop Mambéty conjured the ravishing Touki Bouki, destined to be known now as the film that inspired Jay Z and Beyoncé tour poster. There was a new wave in Australia, fronted by Peter Weir ( Picnic at Hanging Rock ) and Fred Schepisi ( The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith ), as well as in Germany, where Fassbinder and Herzog were in their prolific pomp, producing cinematic provocations faster than audiences could devour them. Buñuel bowed out with a hat-trick of barbed, subversive comedies, beginning with The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie . Cries and Whispers and Scenes from a Marriage showed that Bergman rage had survived into middle age. The French new wavers descended into scrapping – Godard attacked Truffaut wonderful film about film-making, Day For Night , and got called “a piece of shit on a pedestal” in return – but its pioneers still thrived: this was the decade, after all, of Jacques Rivette Out and the berserk Céline and Julie Go Boating. From Top Gun to Stand By Me: why the is my favourite film decade Divisions between arthouse and mainstream were overturned in the with A-list stars drawn to the arthouse – Jack Nicholson in Antonioni The Passenger , Jane Fonda in Godard Tout Va Bien, Ryan O’Neal in Kubrick Barry Lyndon . If none of that settles the case for the as the most thrilling decade of cinema yet, mull over these titles: Annie Hall , Deep End, The Devils , Dog Day Afternoon, In the Realm of the Senses, Straight Time, The Spirit of the Beehive and the scandalous Thundercrack! Or these emerging directors: Chantal Akerman , Bertrand Blier , John Carpenter , David Cronenberg , Terence Davies , Bill Douglas , Derek Jarman , Diane Kurys, George Miller , Ridley Scott . By the end of the decade, Thatcher was in power, Reagan was lurking in the wings, and Heaven Gate was about to help kill off Hollywood appetite for rolling the dice. It would be irresponsibly misty-eyed to claim things would never be that adventurous again. Let just say that nothing so radical or explosive can last for ever.",763,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/03/my-favourite-film-decade-1970s-dont-look-now-the-godfather-jaws
68,"The were the making of Hollywood. When the decade began, films were monochrome, still sometimes silent (the majority had sound only from and largely uncensored. By the end, some were in glorious Technicolor, most had sound, and all were obliged to conform to a strict code of wholesomeness: a transformation embodied on screen in The Wizard of Oz . When assessing those years, the word “iconic” is liable to be overused. There were iconic war films (All Quiet on the Western Front), comedies ( Modern Times , Duck Soup ), westerns (Stagecoach), romances ( It Happened One Night ), political dramas (Mr Smith Goes to Washington), monster movies (King Kong), animations (Snow White), adventure films (The Adventures of Robin Hood, Tarzan the Ape-Man), epics ( Gone With the Wind ), fantasies (The Wizard of Oz), and films that stand alone ( Freaks ). Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made their finest musical, the wickedly funny Top Hat . Garbo talked in Anna Christie, laughed in Ninotchka, and kissed another woman in Queen Christina. In Blonde Venus, Marlene Dietrich dressed as a gorilla, then stripped down to an incredibly racist costume to a sing an incredibly racist song to Cary Grant. Shirley Temple made tooth-achingly sweet movies whose tremendous appeal in their time is, to modern viewers, obscure. Horror films set the mould. Our enduring images of Frankenstein monster and Dracula arguably owe more to their screen portrayals by Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi than to their creators, Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker. It was all too much for American conservatives, whose outrage led to the Hays Code being enforced from The guidelines decreed that movies would no longer be allowed to show any sympathy with crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin. Under its many provisions, there would be no nudity, no “sex perversion” (homosexuality or cross-dressing), no miscegenation, no drugs, no booze unless it was essential to the plot, no profanity, no “indecent” dancing, no “white slavery”, and no scenes of childbirth, even if in silhouette. The code remained in place, raining on everyone parades, until Pre-code films reveal a full of people drinking, swearing and having sex, just like all the other decades in history. One of the movies that prompted the implementation of the code was Baby Face a scandalous “sex film” in which former child prostitute Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) falls under the influence of a Nietzschean cobbler (“Use men to get the things you want!”). She escapes to New York with her African American collaborator, Chico (Theresa Harris). At one point, Lily seduces a married man in a lavatory; at another, a pre-stardom John Wayne. As the men get richer, Lily and Chico furs get plusher. Lily is a remarkably strong female lead, and Chico, though poorly served by the screenplay, is at least shown to have her friendship and respect. What upset the supposed guardians of morality was not just sex and violence – though there was plenty of both – but women and people of colour not knowing their place, and LGBTQ people wanting a place at all. From The Naked City to Double Indemnity – why the is my favourite film decade Film-makers pushed against the rules. In Bringing Up Baby , made under the code in Cary Grant marches around in Katharine Hepburn marabou-trimmed dressing gown, bellowing: “I just went gay all of a sudden!” The censors let it through because they did not understand what was then relatively cryptic slang, though Grant and Hepburn surely did. The most famous line in Gone With the Wind was altered from “My dear, I don’t give a damn” in the book, to Clark Gable oddly emphasised “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn” on screen, to distract censors from the profanity. Even so, producer David O Selznick had to fight for it. Thanks to him, the code was altered to allow the words “hell” and “damn” to be spoken, though only if they were in a historical context or a quotation from a literary work. To appreciate the in world cinema would require a much longer piece. Outside the US, this was the decade of Fritz Lang M , Alfred Hitchcock The Steps , Sergei Eisenstein Alexander Nevsky , and the birth of Bombay talkies . Yet the will forever signal the beginning of Hollywood golden age: dragging audiences out of the Depression and into a whirl of glamour and fantasy before the next big war could hit.",744,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/02/my-favourite-film-decade-1930s-wizard-of-oz-top-hat-hays-code
69,"he was when everything was shaken up and anything went. A new generation got their hands on cinema, and they took it to places it had never been before: out of the studios and into the streets; into inner consciousness and psychedelic realms; out into the cosmos and the future. They made what went before look square, Daddio. It started with the French. Even in the François Truffaut was labelling the stuffy, classical studio fare that had gone before “le cinema de papa”. By the end of the decade, he and Jean-Luc Godard , among others, were ready to show the world the alternative. Their debuts, Truffaut The Blows and Godard Breathless, were both made in (neither arrived in British cinemas until but they set the tone for the decade: hand-held cameras! Real locations! Politics! Jump cuts! Irony! Vitality! Modern life! Death to papa! The ripples spread from the French New Wave and suddenly other countries had their own new waves, in name or in spirit: Czechoslovakia, India, Brazil, Italy. In alone, Italy gave us Fellini La Dolce Vita and Antonioni L’Avventura. Bored with blockbusters? Why Hollywood needs another Bonnie and Clyde moment British cinema had its own variation of the new wave, starting with the Free Cinema documentary movement and the “angry young man” and kitchen-sink realism currents that launched the careers of Lindsay Anderson (This Sporting Life, If), Tony Richardson and John Schlesinger. But then in came another revolution in the form of the Beatles and Richard Lester A Hard Day Night , a piece of avant-garde pop playfulness whose surprise commercial success forced studio execs to acknowledge that they no longer knew anything. Some of those British movies are still my all-time favourites, in particular Antonioni Blow-Up and Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg Performance – both ostensibly by-products of that swinging London moment, but mining far darker and deeper themes. On both sides of the Atlantic, pop culture and the counterculture steadily took over, to the extent that by the end of the decade Hollywood itself was made “new”. The cumbersome old studio productions lumbered on, but a new breed of stylish, edgy new movies began to take hold: Bonnie and Clyde , The Graduate , Midnight Cowboy , Point Blank . There was still an awful lot of squareness around in the The highest-grossing movie of the decade, for example, was The Sound of Music – a movie that does absolutely nothing to represent the era. But even in mainstream Hollywood, certain films still had a clip to them. Disney has never produced a better movie than The Jungle Book. Hitchcock gave us Psycho and The Birds. And Kubrick gave us the ultimate sci-fi head trip, A Space Odyssey . From Don't Look Now to The Godfather – why the is my favourite film decade If you drew a graph of “fiscal responsibility” versus “wayward experimentalism”, the is the point where they crossed. It was a golden age for studio-budgeted oddness, and so many of my favourite films from the era have that “how did they get away with it?” quality to them. European cinema was a trove of surreal and psychedelic curios such as Vera Chytilova Daisies, Wojciech Haas The Saragossa Manuscript, Sergei Paradjanov The Colour of Pomegranates and Luis Buñuel Belle de Jour. There were intense dramas such as Andrei Tarkovsky Andrei Rublev, Ingmar Bergman Persona and Roman Polanski Repulsion; exuberant pop nonsense such as Barbarella, Modesty Blaise and Smashing Time, or cult movies that were simply way cool, like Russ Meyer Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! and Seijun Suzuki deranged spy thriller Branded to Kill. The were over before I was born, but in my own (mildly) rebellious youth, it was a revelation to discover movies so rebellious and youthful. And back in the pre-internet and you really did have to discover them, which only enhanced the experience. If you didn’t live near a decent repertory cinema (which I didn’t), you’d be lucky to find them playing on late-night television, or at your local video rental store. So now those films are viewed through a double layer of nostalgia, not to mention a political filter that exposes many of them as archaically white- and male-centric, but that sense of vitality and possibility is still palpable. Despite the youthfulness, so many of those works have stood the test of time.",725,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/30/my-favourite-film-decade-1960s-blow-up-bonnie-and-clyde
70,"The hammering that Sean Penn has taken for his novel Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff – particularly the fact that it ends with a poem that calls the #MeToo movement “a toddler crusade” – isn’t purely down to the book being bad. No, it because the book has reinforced the popular notion of Penn as a scrunched-faced misery guy who takes his craft so seriously that it makes him awful to be around. The question is not “Is Sean Penn publicly unbearable?” because clearly the answer to that is a hard yes. Instead, the question is “Is Sean Penn the most publicly unbearable actor working today?” Luckily for everyone, I’ve crunched the numbers and figured out a top five. Russell Crowe What makes Russell Crowe awful is the tortuous lengths he goes to in order to camouflage his awfulness. Yes, he writes songs with guffy titles such as Oblique Is My Love, but then he records them under overcompensatory blokey bandnames such as Odd Foot of Grunts. Yes, he reads poems in lieu of acceptance speeches, but then he threatens people with violence whenever they’re edited. Crowe has the soul of an artist wrapped in the body of a nightclub bouncer, wearing clothes of pure neediness. If it wasn’t for his (very good) idea that Twitter block button should make the sound of a nuclear explosion , he’d be much higher. Jared Leto Jared Leto once published a book called Notes from the Outernet. Jared Leto is in a band that once recorded a song called Vox Populi. Jared Leto once prepared to play Mark Chapman by living on a diet of melted ice cream pints mixed with olive oil and soy sauce. When Jared Leto played the Joker, he sent all his new castmates used condoms and anal beads. Jared Leto is really hard work. Sean Penn Sean Penn debut novel – repellent and stupid on so many levels Sean Penn awfulness has always bubbled away under the surface - see the hectoring open letter he sent to the South Park guys , or his sour defence of Jude Law at the Oscars , or his intense, all-consuming refusal to have any fun whatsoever with any single aspect of his job. But, boy, has it blossomed. Although Penn role in the arrest of El Chapo initially seemed impressive, he managed to squander all that goodwill with a Rolling Stone article that felt like a parody of gruff literary pretension, right down to the opening Montaigne quote. And now there Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff, which contains the line, “While the privileged patronize this pickle as epithet to the epigenetic inequality of equals, Bob smells a cyber-assisted assault emboldened by right-brain Hollywood narcissists” – which just gave me an aneurism. But these are the big leagues, and Penn hasn’t quite got what it takes to top this list. Jim Carrey A lot of actors behave badly during shoots. But so far only Jim Carrey – heavily bearded, sad-clown, retire-from-acting-to-pursue-his-art Jim Carrey – has managed to turn that bad behaviour into a documentary made to rationalise his terrible artistic process. Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond , the film about the Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon – during which Carrey self-consciously absorbed the identity of his character to the tangible annoyance of everyone around him – is a hymn to an ego inflated beyond all measure by the corrupting power of fame and money. Worse, it comes disguised as a jazzed-up inspirational Instagram quote of a message about Carrey notion that identity is nothing more than a “relative mass of manifestation of consciousness”. The whole thing should have been called Please Someone Punch Jim Carrey in the Mouth. James Franco Now, let get some perspective here. The internet has come down on Sean Penn because he wrote a book . Compared to the master, that nothing. James Franco has written several books – books with titles such as Actors Anonymous and Straight James/Gay James and Real and Imaginary Conversations with Lana del Rey – and birthed excruciating side projects, including the documentary Francophrenia (Or Don’t Kill Me, I Know Where the Baby Is) and the band Daddy. He once interviewed his own female alter-ego . And now, just as he was teetering on the brink of mainstream acceptance, he been forced to lie low thanks to allegations of sexual impropriety. Sean Penn may be unbearable, but not even he can hold a candle to James Franco.",749,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/29/sean-penn-novel-russell-crowe-jared-leto-jim-carrey-james-franco
71,"The faint whiff of something rotting at the back of the fridge has attached itself to cinema in recent years. A feeling that movies are on their way out, past their best. It a view endorsed by Martin Scorsese (“Cinema is gone”), Ridley Scott (“Cinema mainly is pretty bad”) and Jane Campion (“The really clever people do television ”). Thing is, they’re wrong. Okay, this decade hasn’t slam-dunked the greatest film ever made, not yet. But the past seven-and-a-bit years have given us vital movies, movies that matter. Out in the real world, a generation of social activists – feminists, LGBTQ campaigners, the Black Lives Matter movement – are ramming equality into the mainstream. Films, too, are doing their bit. The late critic Roger Ebert elegant description of films as “empathy machines” never felt more true. Moonlight , Lady Macbeth , Carol , Call Me by Your Name , Girlhood , God Own Country , The Florida Project , Mustang – these movies put us inside characters who are not straight white men. What does it feel like to live their lives, dream their dreams? (For those of us who don’t already live or dream them.) In the the movie empathy machine has cranked into overdrive. I admit there is a bit of rose-tinting here. The cold hard fact is that when it comes to the lack of women and ethnic minority film-makers, things are no better today than years ago. The #MeToo and Time Up movements show how much work Hollywood needs to do to fix its problem with women. But while female film-makers account for a small percentage of directors (roughly in the US; in the UK), movies by women this decade are making an outsized impact. Name a lady who made a film you’ve loved since Céline Sciamma (Girlhood). Marielle Heller (The Diary of a Teenage Girl). Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird). Deniz Gamze Ergüven (Mustang). Julia Ducournau (Raw). Mia Hansen-Løve (Things to Come, Eden, Goodbye First Love). Maren Ade (Toni Erdmann). Ana Lily Amirpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night). Haifaa al-Mansour (Wadjda). Claire Denis (Let The Sun Shine In). Kathryn Bigelow (Zero Dark Thirty, Detroit). Jennifer Kent (The Babadook). Sarah Polley (Take This Waltz, Stories We Tell). Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman). That without the need of Google. And everywhere you look there a young and sickeningly talented director making movies like there no tomorrow. Damien Chazelle arrived on the scene at with Whiplash then made La La Land . The French-Canadian wonderkid Xavier Dolan bashed out six feature films by the time he was Ryan Coogler, the director of Black Panther, which has passed the barrier at the box office, is And the directors who’ve been round the block a few times? They’ve been busy knocking out their best work in years. The vampire romance Only Lovers Left Alive is one of veteran hipster Jim Jarmusch best movies. Richard Linklater career-topper Boyhood earned him his first best director Oscar nomination. Martin Scorsese is in his but The Wolf of Wall Street felt like it could have been directed by a slip of a lad. Paul Verhoeven made an almighty comeback with Elle . Terrence Malick Tree of Life is a stunning achievement. (Okay, so he should have quit right then and there). For a jolt of pure cinema we’ve had wildly beautiful experimental films like Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives from the Thai auteur Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Leos Carax crackers Holy Motors , Jonathan Glazer Under the Skin and Gaspar Noé Enter the Void . Documentaries are on a roll ( Stories We Tell , The Act of Killing , Amy , I Am Not Your Negro ). Sign up to our Film Today email Perhaps it says something about how much we have to fret about at this point in time that the sci-fi movie is in such rude health ( Her , Gravity , Ex Machina , Arrival , Mad Max: Fury Road and, just this week, Annihilation ). Oh, and three of my top horror films were made this decade: The Babadook , It Follows and Get Out . So, reports of cinema death have been exaggerated. I haven’t got round to A Great Beauty or the staggering holocaust drama Son of Saul . Or Manchester By the Sea or Years a Slave . Or blockbuster juggernauts like the Star Wars franchise.

72,"When the Italian film director Gualtiero Jacopetti, who has died at the age of made Mondo Cane (A Dog Life) in he tapped into people curiosity and provided the strangest commercially successful film in the history of cinema. Audiences not yet accustomed to cheap air travel or the idea of globalisation were unprepared for its colourful National Geographic-style montages of “primitive” rites and “civilised” wrongs. The following year, they flocked to see the film sequels, Mondo Pazzo (Mad World, or Mondo Cane No and La Donna nel Mondo (Women of the World). Mondo Cane was a film made out of a compilation of pithy sequences depicting strange rituals from around the globe. But while Jacopetti documented the peculiarities of what was then described as the third world, he also mocked the alleged superiority of western culture. The stupidity of mass consumerism and the absurd delusions of elite culture suddenly seemed as bizarre as cargo cults and cannibalism. The ambiguity of any political message shocked critics but delighted the novelist JG Ballard , who incorporated the aesthetics of Jacopetti aggressive film style, and a fake “Jacopetti exhibition”, into the narrative of his fragmentary novel The Atrocity Exhibition The power of Mondo Cane came from a side-stepping of documentary neorealist principles in favour of a hyper-realism dubbed “shockumentary” because of its brutal edits (“shock cuts”, Jacopetti once called them), rapid zooms, heightened post-production sound effects and sharp contrasts between mise-en-scene and musical score. The much-recorded ballad More (“More than the greatest love the world has known,” in Norman Newell English lyrics) comes from the film. Jacopetti narrations were satirical, amusing, sad and at all times contemptuously despairing of humanity failings. Following these box-office successes, Jacopetti and the anthropologist Franco Prosperi were able to embark upon Africa Addio (Farewell Africa, a brutal, sprawling document of the post-colonial continent. The team set out to record the destruction of wildlife as unregulated hunting took a grip, but switched to capturing violent decolonisations in Angola, Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda as revolution and counter-revolution exploded in their faces. The film was heavily criticised at the time of release for its alleged racist portrayal of black African people as savages. Jacopetti was accused of interfering in nationalist uprisings and orchestrating executions to fit shooting schedules. These charges were later thrown out of an Italian court. Although it was the European colonisers who were treated most harshly in the film – notably, in a memorably creepy sequence, white South Africans – the bad publicity hit the box office, and the film sank. A reprieve came, much to Jacopetti horror, only in the form of a ghastly truncated US video version retitled Africa Blood and Guts. Jacopetti was born in Barga, Tuscany. During the second world war he was involved in counterespionage with the American forces, and as normal political activity resumed before the election, he worked as a publicist for the Christian Democrats. However, it was through challenging the conformity of postwar Italy that he made his name as a journalist in the liberal weekly news magazine Cronache, which he helped found in It proved to be the forerunner of l’Espresso, launched two years later. After working on newsreels, which Jacopetti tried to make more colourful than the dry, state-sponsored efforts, he teamed up with Prosperi, the cameraman Antonio Climati and the composer Riz Ortolani, a unit that remained constant for all his feature films. In Jacopetti satirised American racism in Addio Zio Tom (Goodbye Uncle Tom) and took a brief diversion to script Fangio, the story of the great Argentinian racing driver Juan Manuel Fangio, for Hugh Hudson. Mondo Candido was another satirical piece, this time a tribute to Jacopetti hero Voltaire, whose most famous work, Candide, seemed to echo Jacopetti own strange traverse through life. Again, cinematic parallels were drawn between seemingly disparate continents across random timescales. Tired of the increasing commercialisation of film industries and the incessant self-publicising necessary to succeed, Jacopetti returned to journalism before retiring to leave his powerful and bizarre creations in the hands of exploitation merchants, gorehounds, censorship bodies – and the term “mondo film” to the lexicon of cinema lore. He was a high-profile figure during Italy economic boom of the postwar period. His charm and good looks led to a number of scandalous incidents that could have been lifted straight out of Fellini La Dolce Vita. Jacopetti asked to be buried in Rome next to the British actor Belinda Lee, with whom he had a relationship. She was killed in a car crash during the making of La Donna nel Mondo. He is survived by his daughter, Christine.

73,"long with attempting to breakdance, sharing an illicit John Player Special, and drenching yourself in Kouros, a common rite of passage for teenage boys in Britain involved sitting in a bedroom watching, and rewatching, gruesome low-grade horror movies. A generation of young males (it was almost exclusively a male thing) thrilled to the sight of bright red blood spurting out of freshly created orifices, psychos on the rampage with domestic hardware and undead monsters feasting on human sashimi. Their parents, meanwhile, were likely to be downstairs reading newspaper stories with titles like ""Rape of Our Children Minds"" that listed in prurient detail the exact same scenes their offspring were playing back in slow motion upstairs. As a cultural phenomenon, video nasties followed a similar pattern to moral panics over new media. Just like computer games or the internet, the explosion in popularity of the video format in the late outpaced government measures to regulate it. And back in the days when you had to pay a substantial fee to join a mainstream video club, hundreds of independent companies sprang up, producing and distributing cheap video movies to which cinema rules of censorship didn't yet apply. Under these conditions, grisly horror movies thrived like maggots on a severed limb. Between the bouffant-haired pincer movement of Mary Whitehouse and Margaret Thatcher, the golden age of disgusting filmic gore was destined to be brief, though the increasingly conspicuous and rapacious video companies could have hastened the end themselves. In Vipco put out a full page colour ad for Abel Ferrara Driller Killer - the notorious drill-bit-entering-forehead shot that would become the defining image of the video nasty era. Shortly after, the distributors of Cannibal Holocaust allegedly wrote a bogus complaint letter to Whitehouse hoping to generate some free publicity. One of the most remarkable aspects, looking back, is the way the meaning of the term ""video nasty"" started off vague but was forced to become preposterously precise. It was first used by a Sunday Times journalist in and as the media frenzy gained momentum, Whitehouse and the other moral custodians each put forward their own definition of what a video nasty was. The then-termed British Board of Film Censors defined obscenity as that which may ""tend to corrupt and deprave"", which hardly clarified matters. So when the police took action, and started conducting raids on video shops, not only were different titles seized in different parts of the country, comical errors were committed by film-illiterate coppers. Some confiscated the innocuous Dolly Parton musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas; others saw pornographic connotations in the title of Sam Fuller second world war drama, The Big Red One. Finally, an official list of titles was settled on, so prosecutors and collectors knew what to look for. To be fair, ""video nasty"" is a fairly accurate description of most of the titles on the list. Of course, they were on video, but most of them really were pretty nasty - in terms of quality as much as content. Italian horror movies, especially, are wearyingly derivative, as the interchangeable titles suggest (pick any combination of the words ""zombie"", ""cannibal"", ""apocalypse"", ""blood"" and ""dead"" and it probably been made). You can imagine Mrs Whitehouse (who admitted she'd never actually watched a video nasty) being shocked out of her pop sox by descriptions of a cannibal beast eating its own entrails, or a woman eye being impaled by a shard of glass - but had she seen the real thing, she would more likely have laughed. The acts were unspeakable, but the special effects were even worse. They're the sort of thing that could only be have been appreciated by an audience of excitable adolescents. In the quest to break new taboos, though, many go beyond simple gore. Violence against women seems to be an overriding theme. Some depicted rape, torture, racial murder, bestiality and beyond - with no apparent objective beyond simply putting it on the screen. It hard to imagine there was a substantial market for the most extreme titles, but as a result of their inclusion on the list, movies such as Don't Go in the Woods or The Gestapo Last Orgy, have endured far longer than they would have otherwise. But for every negligible exploitationer on the list, there was a classic. Dario Argento Tenebrae and Inferno, for example, display a visual finesse and operatic bravery that lift them above the other Italian entries. One of the most notorious titles on the list, Cannibal Holocaust, combines its gruesome imagery with an intelligent, politically motivated plot in which sensation-seeking film-makers enter the Amazon jungle, and slide from ethnographic inquiry to colonialist oppression before ending up as lunch. The theme, and the way the movie is constructed from the explorers' ""found"" footage, were directly borrowed by The Blair Witch Project. Many of the superior blacklisted US horrors took pains to put their horror into some sort of social context. Wes Craven The Last House on the Left, for example, which inspired a slew of similar rape-revenge movies, transposed Bergman Virgin Spring to post-hippie, post-Manson American suburbia. Sam Raimi comically gory The Evil Dead is still regarded as one of the finest horror movies in existence, and even Ferrara Driller Killer, for all its notoriety, mapped out some plausible triggers for its protagonist pathology: artistic impotence, sexual frustration, punk rock. Who could have foreseen that years on, Craven would have a mainstream thriller raking it in at the box office (Red Eye), or that Raimi would go on to direct Spider-Man and its sequel, two of the highest-grossing movies of all time? · The Box of the Banned DVD collection (Anchor Bay, is released on September",949,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/09/3
74,"Nicolas Cage has expressed his frustration with “Cage rage” internet memes, saying they are “frustrating” and unfair to him and the directors of his films. In an interview with Indiewire to promote his latest film Mandy , a gory action-horror in which Cage plays a revenger looking to take down a satanic biker gang, Cage said: “I’m sure it frustrating for [director] Panos [Cosmatos], who has made what I consider a very lyrical, internal, and poetic work of art, to have this ‘Cage rage’ thing slammed all over his movie … the internet has kind of done the movie a disservice.” Cage rage is the name given to images and compilations of the actor over-the-top, grimacing, eye-bulging performances – for which he has become notorious. Cage went on to elaborate the thinking behind his theatrical acting style, saying he aimed to realise his “abstract and more ontological fantasies with film performance, by playing people who were crazy, or by playing people who were on drugs, or supernaturally possessed”. He added: “It all very thought out and carefully planned.” Cage also said he was aware of fellow actor Ethan Hawke admiring comments in a Reddit Ask Me Anything webchat , in which Hawke said Cage was “the only actor since Marlon Brando that actually done anything new with the art of acting; he successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours”. Cage responded: “That made me feel good … The list goes on and on about these old troubadours who embraced a kind of charismatic and larger-than-size stylisation. A grandeur, if you will.”",280,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/19/nicolas-cage-rage-internet-meme-mandy
75,"The actor Ethan Hawke has questioned the quality of superhero films, saying that even the most praised are “not Bresson ... not Bergman. But they talk about it like it is”. In an interview with the Film Stage , Hawke discussed what he saw as the increasing marginalisation of indie movies at the multiplex. “Now we have the problem that they tell us Logan is a great movie,” he said. “Well, it a great superhero movie. It still involves people in tights with metal coming out of their hands. It not Bresson. It not Bergman. But they talk about it like it is.” Logan , in which Hugh Jackman played an ageing Wolverine, won acclaim for what many saw as an emotional depth unusual in the genre. Its screenplay won nominations from the Academy Awards and Writers Guild of America. Hawke continued: “I went to see Logan cos everyone was like, ‘This is a great movie’ and I was like, ‘Really? No, this is a fine superhero movie.’ There a difference, but big business doesn’t think there a difference. Big business wants you to think that this is a great film because they wanna make money off of it.” Hawke comments met with a mixed reception online, where many accused him of pretentiousness. The actor – who is currently winning acclaim for his performance in Paul Schrader First Reformed – was accused of a similar elitism five years ago, when he attacked the Oscars for celebrating “forgettable, stupid movies” and “mediocre performers”. “Making a priority of chasing these fake carrots and money and dubious accolades,” was, he said, “I think, really destructive.”",272,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/27/ethan-hawke-superhero-movies-are-overrated-logan
76,"hat kind of masochists would attend an all-night Nicolas Cage movie marathon? What kind of sadists would program seven of his films in a row? If one wants to observe the famously extravagant American actor for hours straight, why not do it from the comfort of your own home? I ponder these questions en route to the Melbourne international film festival overnight Cage-a-Thon, and think about how I might answer them myself. I have always been a fan of Cage work, perhaps even a big one, but did I really understand the reverence he elicits from his fans? I did not. Any casual observer can see that Cage is entertaining, charismatic and wildly flamboyant, but what is it about the performer that deserves seven movies, played back-to-back? Five years ago, in a Reddit AMA , Ethan Hawke described Cage as “the only actor since Marlon Brando that actually done anything new with the art”, by taking audiences “away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours.” The description stuck with me. Cage, who was raised in a well-cultured family (his father was a professor of literature, his mother a dancer, and his uncle is the great director Francis Ford Coppola) is clearly attracted to grotesque characters and is celebrated for his wild and unhinged approach to them. He has the presence of a leading man, and the eccentricities of a character actor. What else will I glean from an all-night marathon? I imagine the audience at the Cage-a-Thon will be a small group of weirdos who all look like Max Schreck from Nosferatu, or extras from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I am instead surprised to discover a crowd of around normal-looking people gathered at Melbourne famous Astor theatre. When the words “Nicolas Cage” appear during the opening credits of the first feature to be screened, the phantasmagoric revenge thriller Mandy, the crowd goes ballistic. Fast-forward hours. I’ve consumed lots of coffee, a little whiskey and a can of Red Bull the size of a car battery. The audience – thinned to around diehards determined to stay to the end – are exhausted but jubilant. The whooping and cheering that began in Mandy has continued all the way to the grand finale: the action blockbuster Con Air. When Cage delivers a memorable line of dialogue (such as “ I said put the bunny back in the box ”), we cheer. When he winks or runs or jumps or fly kicks, we cheer. When he grabs a ladder attached to a fire engine and holds on for dear life, by God do we cheer. Mandy review – Nicolas Cage goes full freakout in gory vengeance thriller The first time the crowd truly loses it – erupting into the kind of hullabaloo I imagine the Romans made for gladiators – arrives about halfway through Mandy. Covered in blood and dressed in briefs and a shirt, Cage gulps vodka straight from the bottle and pours it over a gaping wound. He then sits on a toilet seat and pants as if possessed, inhaling and exhaling like some kind of horrible mythical creature. The crowd cannot get enough of it. The second feature film is the Coen brothers’ zany comedy Raising Arizona and the third, the director John Dahl neo-noir Red Rock West. This film begins with a topless Cage doing exercises on a wide open road – eliciting hearty applause and the first (but not the last) sustained round of wolf whistles. But it is during the fourth feature – the black comedy Vampire Kiss – that all hell breaks loose. Vampire Kiss is the movie you recommend if Cage greatness is ever called into question. His performance as a maniacal literary agent perfectly encapsulates why David Lynch described him as “the jazz musician of American acting”. Or, less charitably, why Sean Penn once famously called Cage “no longer an actor” and “more like a performer”. You could deride Cage for over-acting, as many have, or you could say his performance in Vampire Kiss is so exquisitely eccentric – so wild and restless and imaginative – it virtually defies description. I’ll have a crack anyway: it German expressionism meets Monty Python absurdism meets contemporary dance. The legendary alphabet scene generates a response so loud and enthusiastic I can feel my seat shaking. By the time the fifth film begins – the director Neil LaBute critically maligned remake of The Wicker Man – it around With utter horror I realise there are around five hours left. Advertised as a event, the schedule – which includes short breaks and a dozen or so trailers for Cage lesser-known works – has blown out to The grindhouse-style B movie Drive Angry is the second-last on the bill. It contains a scene featuring Cage having sex with a woman in a cruddy motel while simultaneously shooting an influx of bad guys entering their room. He is thrusting and penetrating and spinning around their conjoined bodies while taking down his oppressors one by one. This fascinating and ghastly display – a gun-slinging moment from a western, crossed with a tantric sex routine – wakes me up more than the coffee. The audience is smaller but louder than ever during Con Air. When we whoop as Cage swings from the ladder attached to the fire engine, it occurs to me that we are not applauding individual moments but an entire career. I arrived at the Cage-a-Thon a fan of Cage work. I left it with a new-found respect, and now consider him one of my favourite actors. Is there another actor anywhere in the world as original and distinctive? In Cage hands, cartoonish moments are imbued with real emotion and real emotions become cartoons. Everything – from individual scenes down to single lines of dialogue – feel like they have been embraced as opportunities for creation. Cage is usually interesting even when his films are not. He is erratic and unpredictable; he is captivating and he is capricious. He is a performer. He is a troubadour. He is a jazz musician. When I leave the Cage-a-Thon, dimly remembering a time when I watched movies that didn’t star Nicolas Cage, I resolve to never ever attend another movie marathon. Two days later I make a slight adjustment. If it another one with Nic Cage movies, I’ll think about it.

77,"If there were ever a Marmite actor, dividing opinion equally between those who believe he is a maverick genius and those who see him as a giant ham, it is Nicolas Cage . When the part is right, as it was for Cage Oscar-winning role as a suicidal alcoholic in Mike Figgis Leaving Las Vegas, or as an unhinged cop in Werner Herzog mesmeric Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans , he is one of the most watchable actors on the planet. When Cage goes too far out on a limb – one need hardly mention his infamous “ The bees! ” scene in Neil LaBute horrendous remake of The Wicker Man – it can feel as if he is not only appearing in a completely different movie from those around him, but perhaps inhabiting a parallel acting reality. At least Cage tries things – his decision to channel Adam West as vigilante Big Daddy in the comic book flick Kick-Ass was inspired, and helped mark that movie out from the crowd. The problem is that the things Cage tries are as likely to go wrong as right, and once they have done so there seems to be no off switch. That should perhaps lead us to view with caution the actor suggestion this week that he might make a decent Joker in an upcoming Batman movie. “I mean, I think my comic book days are kind of … I’m on to other things,” Cage, a noted comic-book fan whose son is named Kal-El after Superman birth name, told JoBlo . “But I always thought I’d make a great Joker and I always thought that I would’ve been a good villain in one of the Marvel [movies] like Doctor Doom ... At this point if I was to go back into the format it would probably have to be as a villain.” With apologies to the Fantastic Four super villain, it Cage suggestion that he might enjoy getting under the clown prince of Gotham skin that has grabbed most of the attention online. There appears to be little in the way of an opening right now at DC, with Jared Leto still inhabiting Batman nemesis for the DC Extended Universe movies and Joaquin Phoenix reportedly lined up to take the role in Todd Phillips upcoming Martin Scorsese-inspired Joker origin movie . But if DC studio Warner Bros is prepared to undermine Leto by casting another actor in a completely different take on the cackling supervillain, it should hardly be a stretch for studio execs to greenlight a third production. It not difficult to see why Cage is drawn to The Joker. For it ought, in theory, to be impossible to overact while playing the role. Not for a moment, we imagine, did Mark Hamill rein himself in while portraying the villain in the wonderful TV show Batman: The Animated Series. Jack Nicholson hardly kept his powder dry for that pantomime turn in Tim Burton Batman and Heath Ledger put everything on the table in Christopher Nolan The Dark Knight And yet there is a fear that a Cage Joker might sending the movie he appeared in into a ravine. The actor seems too risky a proposition to replace Leto in the DCEU movies, where an unwieldy performance might further derail a cinematic universe. His Doctor Doom would be intriguing, however, and there is space to try for a definitive take on the Fantastic Four nemesis. Fargo and Legion Noah Hawley is said to be working on an origins story for the supervillain – though it unclear whether that production is likely to survive the character imminent move from Fox to Disney . It hard to imagine the big cheeses at Marvel casting Cage, given the actor propensity for eccentric decision-making and the MCU episodic nature. Cage as Doom might well become a highlight of the cinematic universe. But it just as likely that the star of the Ghost Rider movies would do something characteristically brave and daft at the same time, like deciding to play the part in unwieldy homage to Bela Lugosi (in tribute to Doom eastern European origins). That something I’m sure we’d all pay good money to see – once. But the novelty might well wear off after another episodes.",714,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/11/nicolas-cage-joker-batman-gotham
78,"lthough I’m obviously no expert, it wouldn’t surprise me if The Snowman turned out to be a historic flop. That isn’t a slight against Jo Nesbo or Michael Fassbender or Rebecca Ferguson or Tomas Alfredson, who are all talented people. But it is a slight against whoever in charge of The Snowman marketing campaign, because it is absolutely preposterous. The Snowman review – Michael Fassbender plays it cool in watchable Jo Nesbø thriller The trailer, as we already know , attempted to wring a nonexistent sense of dread out of some actual snowmen, even though snowmen sit slightly below Porgs in their ability to terrify the populace. And now we have the posters which, although they ostensibly take the form of ransom notes from a serial killer, look as if they were drawn by a slightly distracted toddler. It hard to think of a movie poster as unintentionally hilarious as The Snowman. However, I’m sure we can come pretty close. Forgetting Sarah Marshall If you’ve made a middling romcom and you want to draw attention to it, why not create a series of guerrilla-style posters that go out of their way to disparage the female lead character by name, while barely referencing the film at all? Well, perhaps because you’ve picked a relatively common name for your character, and people who share that name are likely to feel victimised and terrified by it. This was the case with Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which announced itself with handwritten posters reading “You suck, Sarah Marshall”, “You do look fat in those jeans, Sarah Marshall” and “My mom always hated you Sarah Marshall”, that only succeeded in annoying real-life Sarah Marshalls or, worse, the family of a Sarah Marshall who’d just died. Yogi Bear One of two things happened here. One possibility is that the Yogi Bear marketing team simply wanted to play up the partnership between Yogi Bear and BooBoo, making them both look as happy and approachable as they could while utilising their famous height difference, and decided to adapt the phrase “Great things come in pairs” to reflect their Ursidae nature. The other possibility is that they knew. They knew both meanings of “come” and both meanings of “bear”. One of these possibilities definitely happened, and I’m not sure which is worse. Ondine The poster for Colin Farrell drama Ondine has only retroactively become excruciating, and that all down to its tagline. Back in “The truth is not what you know, it what you believe” seemed like nothing more than a meaningless jumble of words that appeared to have more emotional resonance than it actually did. Fast forward eight years and it become the primary slogan for everything bad in the world. “The truth is not what you know, it what you believe” is what caused Trump and Brexit and countless other global catastrophes. It is post-truth incarnate. Tomb Raider A poster more notable for its witless use of Photoshop than anything else. At this stage, nobody has seen the new Tomb Raider movie but, judging by Alicia Vikander appearance here, it likely to be the story of a woman tragically born with a foam pool noodle for a neck, who realises her potential for raiding tombs after spinning her head around like a concussed owl for three and a half hours. The Accidental Husband You haven’t seen The Accidental Husband. Of course you haven’t. Nobody has. However, from its poster we can safely assume that Colin Firth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan both play men in love with the same cardboard Uma Thurman cinema standee. However, their love is compounded by the fact that they’re both suing a local surgeon for botched arm transplant operations. “How will I ever get Cardboard Uma to love me if my hand looks absolutely nothing like the rest of my body?” Firth whines at one point. Bangkok Dangerous I asked a few friends if they knew of any unintentionally awful movie posters, and the response was universally: “What about that film where Nicolas Cage thumb looks like a penis?” So, behold, here is the Bangkok Dangerous poster, in which Nicolas Cage thumb looks like a penis. Street Kings Again, this is a film I haven’t seen because life is finite and my time here is precious. However, it seems to be about Keanu Reeves’ magic gun, a sassy little thing that apparently fires even when Keanu hand is nowhere near the trigger. Can these two lovably mismatched rogues – a cop who only wants to kill some people and a gun who wants to mow people down indiscriminately – find commonality by the third act? Fingers crossed! Years a Slave You remember Years a Slave, right? It won Oscars for its unflinching portrayal of Brad Pitt face, right up nice and close, beaming against a glorious sky, at the exclusion of everything else, for two and a half hours. Actually, now I come to think of it, there might have also been a black man in the film. I can’t remember who he was, though, because he was barely in it and you could never see his face properly. Still, Brad Pitt. Confessions of a Shopaholic Usually, women find their bodies have been manipulated to “increase” their sexual availability; witness Keira Knightley in the King Arthur poster , for example (she later criticised her “strange droopy tits” on the poster). Is it better or worse, then, that Isla Fisher only had her shoulder, elbow and forearm Photoshopped impossibly for this? A newcomer would be forgiven for thinking that Confessions of a Shopaholic was a film about a woman who deliberately mangled her arm in a car door to stop herself from buying any more things. Though, to be fair, that does sound like a far better film. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part And now to my all-time favourite movie poster. Three months before the release of the final Hunger Games movie, the film studio attempted to gee up some interest with a countdown campaign. days until The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part it said. However, because the film title was so unwieldy, some of the words had to be moved around. And so “until” was sandwiched between and “Days”, and the final zero of had a slice chopped out of it, and not a single person realised what they’d done until the posters went up and everyone wondered why a young adult movie poster suddenly had an incredibly offensive C-word written right in the middle of it.

79,"ridiculous movie when it was released in June Nicolas Cage bumpy flight Con Air only seems more absurd years later. The debut of UK director Simon West , it is a thundering action blowout so loud, haywire and sentimental that – in perhaps the ultimate backhanded compliment – it is often misidentified as a Michael Bay movie. Certainly it feels like a natural bridge between two of Bay pre-Transformers hits: The Rock , where Cage first seemed to get a real taste for being an action star, and Armageddon , another high-concept blockbuster hip to the benefits of recruiting an overqualified ensemble. All three movies bear the glossy, golden-hued, MTV-derived imprimatur of mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer . But thanks to some unpredictable recipe of casting and charisma, Con Air remains the oddest of popcorn movies: half disreputable prison flick, half gleaming Aerosmith video. The juicy setup – a prison transport plane commandeered by its “worst of the worst” cargo of convicts, a volatile gang of jailbirds unaware that one of their number is a paroled US Ranger who will do anything to reunite with his family – could probably have carried a decent B-movie without the need for brand-name stars. But Bruckheimer and West stuffed their cast with a murderer row of talent. As hijack mastermind Cyrus “the Virus” Grissom, John Malkovich pushed his air of vulpine irritability to glorious new heights, plausibly alpha-dogging a planeload of bad dudes including Ving Rhames , Danny Trejo , a never creepier Steve Buscemi and, in a small but vital part, the livewire standup Dave Chappelle . In what could have been the thankless role of a G-man stuck on the ground attempting to wrest back control of the situation, John Cusack adds nervy energy to his usual sleepy-eyed sarcasm and becomes that rare cinematic beast, the FBI agent who actually seems cool. And at the centre of it all, somehow playing the straight man amid all the bombast and bluster, is Cage as Cameron Poe, the burdened soldier who just wants to go home. Despite endless scenes of a massive cargo plane being tossed about and a spectacular series of crashes and explosions, the most impressive visual effect is still Cage hair, a luxurious hillbilly mullet, of which Fabio would be proud. There is a sense, when rewatching Con Air, of a wanton profligacy. Surely some of the budget could have been better spent on telling some other story? Surely actors of this calibre could have been involved in something more meaningful instead? Surely you could wrap up the plot without adding another entire chase sequence in Las Vegas? Yet the feeling that every actor is fully committed to the macho ridiculousness – and given free rein to put some gnarly topspin on their lines – is infectious. For decades, blockbusters have been pejoratively compared to fast food, but Con Air feels super-sized in the best way: a glistening, headbanging assault on the senses. Two decades on, has it left a discernible cinematic footprint? It certainly shares some DNA with the Fast and the Furious , a franchise that has increasingly looked to the sky for thrills even if it seems to prefer its heroes bald. And when The Force Awakens director JJ Abrams was brainstorming names for Oscar Isaac dashing X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron, surely he was thinking of Cage noble asskicker. More gonzo than Snakes on a Plane , more muscular than Liam Neeson Non-Stop , Con Air could proudly claim to be the best aeroplane-related action movie of all time, even if it wasn’t quite the biggest of summer That honour fell to Air Force One , an equally patriotic but rather more stately movie and one that, sadly, does not hinge on requesting a bunny be put back in a box.

80,"wo movie star careers blighted by scandal, divorce and riotous, almost maniacal overspending and excess: it been both high comedy and cautionary tale to watch the simultaneous dissolution of Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt over the last year. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales review – Cap'n Jack panto back Brad, as we know, got kicked out of the house last year by a properly furious Angelina Jolie. At the time, I wondered if Stoner Brad would ever grace our screens again. He been back lately, speaking candidly about how he jettisoned the booze and bong-hits in a GQ interview , but time will only tell whether he’ll be able to turn that good grace into box-office hits. Like his pal Clooney, he still can’t boss an opening weekend (see: Allied, Tomorrowland). But Pitt is not nearly so tarnished as Depp, who has flailed around since the catastrophic end of his marriage to Amber Heard. If, like me, you’ve long thought of Depp as a meretricious movie star whose performances have no more depth than a spray tan, then there is cold pleasure to be derived from the lawsuits firing into Depp intray. The man allegedly spent per month on wine alone (was he filling his swimming pools with it?). Now his creditors surround him like a ring of angry fire ants, seeking the yacht, the houses, the many, many toys and million-dollar knick-knacks.

That recession recalibrated the actual dollar-value of movie stars, at least from the perspective of the suddenly financially embattled studios who had to shell out for them, success or flop. Since then, those economics have shifted drastically, as have the kinds of movies the studios make – tent pole-franchises, mostly – and the kind of people they cast in them (younger, nicer, cheaper, etc). Suddenly, male actors who make other kinds of movies are ageing into mid-career obsolescence as quickly as female actors once did. The idea that ageism has caught up with their tiresome rock-star behaviour is almost as satisfying as watching Meryl Streep cruise nobly into her late with a full dance card of upcoming productions. Once when you said a movie star name, it carried freight and weight. Cagney, Grant, Stanwyck, Crawford, Stewart, Taylor, Mitchum, Audrey, Marilyn: those names have instantly clear meanings still.

81,"ne thing definitely worth salvaging from the wreckage of Prometheus ? Michael Fassbender David, the hyper-capable android with a clipped English accent and inbuilt superiority complex. In Ridley Scott sequel Alien: Covenant , Fassbender is back for a double-shift, playing both the original David – reintroduced via a cryptic prologue – and Walter, an updated synthetic now shipping with an American accent. Despite the challenge of finding the nuances in playing what are essentially two operating systems on legs, Fassbender acquits himself well, even when delivering dialogue like: “I’ll do the fingering.” So how does this latest dual performance stack up against other actors who have played opposite themselves on screen? Nicolas Cage: Adaptation The Kaufman twins, Charlie and Donald, both look suspiciously like paunchy, frizzy-haired versions of Nic Cage. Some physical differentiation between the two might have helped audiences orient themselves amid the structural chicanery and postmodern flourishes of Spike Jonze Adaptation , based on screenwriter Charlie Kaufman real-life struggles to adapt Susan Orlean non-fiction bestseller The Orchid Thief. Thankfully, there was no need, because Cage inhabits both Charlie (the self-loathing worrywart) and Donald (the party-hearty doofus) so vividly you can instinctively tell them apart by body language alone. Lindsay Lohan: The Parent Trap In the original version of The Parent Trap, Hayley Mills was convincingly replicated into twins by advanced visual effects overseen by Walt Disney himself. In the remake, the plot remains the same – two long-lost sisters meet unexpectedly, then conspire to reunite their estranged parents by pulling the classic switcheroo – but there is an increased emphasis on Atlantic-crossing accent work. Making an impressively assured movie debut , Lohan ably delivers both Hallie US teen-speak and Annie cut-glass English as the sparky sisters bond over fencing duels and ad-hoc ear-piercing. Tom Hardy: Legend In the spirit of Armie Hammer seamlessly playing the Winklevoss brothers in The Social Network , Hardy offered up a CG-assisted, Bane-inflected BOGOF for Legend , writer-director Brian Helgeland star-struck retelling of the Kray twins’ rise to gangland dominance in London. Even with his facial expressions mostly restricted to scowls and glares, Hardy is mesmeric as both Reggie, the fiercely loyal legbreaker, and Ronnie, whose comfy cardies and Two Ronnies eyewear disguise a terrifying unpredictability. Adding another brace of evocative brogues to Hardy ever-expanding collection of gnarly accents was just a bonus. Cate Blanchett: Coffee and Cigarettes Bill Murray, Iggy Pop and Steve Coogan were just some of Jim Jarmusch boho friends tapped to star as heightened versions of themselves in his anthology of shaggy-dog vignettes. Cate Blanchett went the extra mile, playing both highly strung actress Cate and her leery rock-chick cousin Shelly. Attempting to reconnect in the lobby of a hotel where “Cate” is enduring a press junket, it is a deft two-hander, so convincing in its portrayal of family prickliness that the dual-role gimmick melts away. Inhabiting multiple roles is becoming a Blanchett trademark: she plays different characters in Julian Rosefeldt ambitious art installation-turned-upcoming movie Manifesto . Ewan McGregor: The Island In Michael Bay sledgehammer sci-fi blockbuster , Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor play two sheltered clones who break out of a blandly sinister future-prison to seek out their original “sponsors”. Due to some tragic circumstances, Johansson never gets to meet her real-world equivalent face-to-face. But McGregor naive but noble replicant has multiple scenes opposite his brash Scottish sire, a moneybags speedboat designer with a love of flash cars and an eye for the ladies, cloned or otherwise. While the film is a deafening disaster, it was at least a good trial run for McGregor, currently playing two bickering brothers in season three of Fargo .

82,"News reaches us this week, from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them director David Yates, that the next film in the Harry Potter spin-off will not “explicitly” mention the gayness of Hogwarts honcho Albus Dumbledore. This is an exciting development for keen followers of the wizard constantly evolving sexuality. The first step in the fictional magician journey came in when, after writing a series of seven books that never mentioned Dumbledore fancying anyone at all, JK Rowling delighted an audience of Potterheads by “revealing” that he was gay. Quite how somebody is supposed to be gay without it ever being said, written or observed is for greater minds than mine to fathom, but this apparently throwaway comment duly entered Potter lore. Time-travel ahead years, and David Yates finds himself making Fantastic Beasts the entire point of which is that it about Gellert Grindelwald, whom Rowling had said (but not written) that Dumbledore was in love with. So the film-makers of this Potter-adjacent franchise that nobody had foreseen are in a spot of bother, since for obvious reasons it would be politically and financially savvy if the new films could also somehow get away with him being gay while never stating it, like the seven books and eight films we’ve already had. That the thing with coming out, or being an ally: you might actually have to run the risk of taking some sort of personal hit, or having to stand up for yourself. This refrain isn’t new, and JK Rowling is not the sole proprietor of a series that wants to be seen to be doing the right thing while saving its own hide. In October of last year, Tessa Thompson tweeted that the bisexuality of Valkyrie would not be “explicitly addressed” in Thor: Ragnarok , but that she had tried to “stay faithful to that in [her] depiction”. The consensus is that it makes no difference whatsoever in the way Valkyrie kicks ass or utters dialogue. But, once again: if a character is not described as black, or gay, or deaf, or very old, the reader or viewer cannot be asked to accept that they are such. The whole point of being in a minority is that your characteristics describe you; your whole identity is marked out by difference, or opposition. Why Dumbledore must not be the token gay person in Fantastic Beasts It easy to be flip about this trend if you aren’t invested in the films concerned. The mooted but never beheld sexuality of Dumbledore, like the Loch Ness monster, is personally hilarious to me – but I don’t belong to a generation that grew up on Potter books. For many young people, the subject of seeing themselves represented in some manner in the universe they love is of deeply felt importance, as can be seen in the many replies to JK Rowling responsibility-shirking tweets on the matter. Studios are beginning to cotton on, albeit with painful slowness, to the idea that alternative sexualities and genders are here to stay, and that their young audiences now have evolved views on representation in movies. The new Star Wars films are doing well with racial representation, fielding increasingly diverse casts, but the one romantic pairing absolutely everybody wants to see from the movies – namely, a hot interstellar make-out sesh between Finn and Poe – has still not materialised. Still, the Star Trek films have got in on the act – however tentatively – and Beauty and the Beast, which made at the box office last year, featured a homosexual moment that the Guardian Peter Bradshaw described as “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it”. Meanwhile, Deadpool is purportedly pansexual and Ezra Miller is the first openly queer lead actor in a superhero franchise (although he revealed last year that studio execs told him he had made a mistake in coming out). Perhaps future Potter-related films will course-correct, and Dumbledore will finally be allowed to blossom into the homosexual man he has apparently been all along. Perhaps these early skirmishes about sexuality and representation will come to seem berserk to future generations, who will be baffled that Rowling characters, being magical creations in an alternative universe, needed to be gendered at all or have a circumscribed sexual bent in the first place. For now, we anxiously await a new development in Dumbledore storied sexuality saga.",721,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/01/fantastic-beasts-2-why-cant-they-just-let-dumbledore-be-gay
83,"Female characters are outnumbered two to one by their male counterparts in the most successful Hollywood films, a new report shows. According to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Sex Roles, authored by US academics Conor Neville and Phyllis Anastasio of Saint Joseph University, just over of characters in of the US top-grossing films of were women. When the analysis was narrowed down to lead characters, the proportion dipped even more, to just over The figures represent an improvement on a similar study from which analysed the box office hits of Then, women comprised of all characters and of lead roles. The census recorded the total female population of the US at million, or Neville said: “Progress has been made, but men still outnumber women two to one in film, which means that the more powerful representations of women seen in our sample are not getting the screen exposure comparable to their proportion in the real world.” Female characters also suffered when it came to on-screen portrayals of leadership: of female characters were portrayed in leadership roles, as opposed to of male. Anastasio said: “Although on the surface, not being portrayed as equal to men in film and television may seem rather inconsequential, inequality is the first step towards violence against any person or groups of people. As subtle as gender inequality is in film, it is just that – inequality – and, as such, it contributes to the overall dehumanisation and victimisation of women.”",246,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/14/female-characters-outnumbered-by-male-hollywood-films
84,"he vengeance-seeking vigilante is one of Hollywood more iconic creations, even if he never been given an easy ride. When Dirty Harry was taking audiences by storm in Pauline Kael dismissed it as “fascist medievalism”, and the morality of such films remains a well-contested topic. Today equivalents, though, inspire no such discussion. The antihero has been allowed to grow a heart, meaning Hollywood is no longer doing its vigilantes justice. The genre latest offering is The Equalizer , in which Denzel Washington plays a softly spoken bookworm with an extracurricular predilection for, in Travis Bickle parlance, washing scum off the streets. By day, he staffs a hardware store and is soon putting its inventory to good use on some Russian mobsters who rough up a young prostitute he become chummy with at the local all-night diner. The film, you may be surprised to hear, is no masterpiece, though there no shortage of good, clean fun to be had as one tattooed goon after another is terminated with extreme prejudice. And yet that exactly the problem: vigilante films were never supposed to be this fun. Eschewing the state-run justice system and siding with a bloodthirsty sociopath isn’t meant to be a wholly pleasant movie-going experience. The genre standard-bearers – Dirty Harry, Taxi Driver , even Death Wish – succeeded by presenting their main men as proper antiheroes, guys who roused and repelled in equal measure, not just badasses with a grievance. Harry Callahan initial takedown scene has become hall-of-fame stuff, but it the sheer terror of the punk staring down Clint Eastwood magnum that makes for such startling viewing. That film also goes to pains to draw parallels between our supposed hero and his child-killing nemesis, while Death Wish made a point of explicitly placing its protagonist at odds with civilised society. Three decades on, as Washington dispenses paternal wisdom to the sweet young lady soon to be beaten to a bloody pulp by vodka-swilling hoodlums, there little question as to which direction our sympathies are being funnelled. The violence in The Equalizer , it has to be said, is pleasingly unflinching (and innovative, too – corkscrews, mallets and even shot glasses are variously deployed to mutilate), but it there to be relished, not ruminated on. If the presence of a teenage hooker is a reminder of our genre territory, then any parallels with Taxi Driver remain superficial. Where De Niro unsettled, Denzel merely soothes. The Equalizer is far from the only recent film guilty of granting its central scumbag too much sympathy. Liam Neeson ever-expanding portfolio of earnest triggermen never have us thinking twice about our principles, and the same applies to the law-shunning protagonists of Man on Fire , Law Abiding Citizen , Outlaw and The Brave One , to name but four from recent years. Each film is happy to follow the narrative template of their forerunners, but will accept none of the thematic weight. The trailer for Keanu Reeves’ absurd-looking new film John Wick promises more of the same: swaths of suited-up thugs gunned down in sexy slo-mo. All well and good, but today vigilantes are superheroes, not antiheroes. There are honourable exceptions. Eastwood himself might have bottled it by revealing Gran Torino racist ’Nam vet to be nothing more than a lovable rogue in the end, but Michael Caine resisted doing the same with his deliciously nasty Harry Brown, with Hugh Jackman ferocious survivalist in last year Prisoners a similarly unnerving presence. But these are few and far between. The fact remains that Hollywood vigilantes have gone soft. Oddly, today justice-seekers provoke none of the controversy of their predecessors despite being infinitely more worthy of Kael reproach. Harry Callahan may have drawn us to the dark side, but at least he made us check ourselves first and when we did side with the killer, we did so against our better instincts. Now, when Liam Neeson unloads his pistol into the face of another Balkan sex trafficker, we watch on with glee rather than guilt. If anything, the genre politics are becoming even more medieval. Today vigilantes could do with reading up on their history – and learning how to do their jobs properly.

85,"Halle Berry won an Oscar once. That worth bearing in mind when you watch the trailer for her new, twice-delayed movie Kidnap. This is an Oscar-winner you’re watching. Just look at the prestige dripping from this thing. Here is Halle Berry, playing a game of brum-brum in her car with her son, whom she loves. I mean, she evidently doesn’t love him enough to keep her eyes on the road, but that beside the point. The film called Kidnap, after all, not Vehicular Homicide Due to Parental Negligence. Berry has taken her son to the world least realistic park. If it were realistic, then all the parents would be exhaustedly slumped in a corner, looking at their phones, while their kids smack each other with discarded condoms and get attacked by wasps. After momentarily turning her back, Halle Berry realises that her son is missing. This is just a wild hunch here, and forgive me if I’m wrong, but I think he might have been kidnapped. Yep, there he is, being kidnapped. Fortunately, this is the year and Halle Berry has a clear view of the kidnapper, so all she needs to do is call the police with the licence-plate number and model of his car and they’ll be able to track it with helicopters. She can’t do that, though, because her phone fell out of her handbag during all the panic. Still, at least she looks like a sensible woman. I see no real reason why she can’t just methodically utilise the services of the local law-enforcement agency to find her son in a manner that doesn’t exploit the very real horror of child abduction for cheap kicks. Oh right. That why she can’t do any of that. So, now that she knows who producing this film, Halle Berry reacts accordingly by chasing the car, pulling this face a lot and screaming like she the last one standing in a slasher movie. Now for the trailer most overtly terrible scene. Finally seeing sense, Halle Berry goes to the police station to report her missing child. An officer tells her to wait and file a report, and that when Berry sees all the posters for missing children. She has an epiphany. “That what all these people did,” she whispers in a piece of real dialogue that someone actually wrote. “They waited.” Yeah, that right, all you idiots with abducted kids. That why you never got your child back. It because you took the time to file a police report instead of haphazardly driving around town crashing into things and screaming. If only you were as much of a badass as Halle Berry, perhaps you’d have found your kid by now. So Berry leaps into her car and attempts to hunt down the kidnapper. She also causes a number of spectacular car crashes along the way. Probably fatal ones, too. It safe to assume that Halle Berry is now responsible for the deaths of dozens of innocent people, but that probably doesn’t matter. After all, what are the police going to do? Their jobs? The trailer ends with Berry staring down her son kidnapper and growling: “You took the wrong kid.” Not “abducting children is wrong, so please stop doing it”. Not “the police will be here in a minute”. “You took the wrong kid.” This is basically a film about a terrifying vigilante who kills innocent people and then chides her son abductor for not performing due diligence during the research phase of his kidnapping. Let that be a lesson to any aspiring child abductors out there: you should only kidnap the children of anyone who looks like they don’t love their kid as much as Halle Berry. Not that it matters, of course, because as soon as she reunited with her son, she getting sent to prison for murder. I hope this film makes no money and ends someone career.",651,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/aug/24/kidnap-trailer-halle-berry-oscar-winner
86,"Every morning, for the three minutes it takes to traverse Victoria station concourse, I am Robert De Niro. Specifically, I'm Robert De Niro as existential anti-hero Neil McCauley in Michael Mann Heat. Devilishly handsome in his razor-sharp goatee, he strides through the film full of intense purpose, his dark, slitted eyes continuously flitting from left to right, clocking everything as he negotiates the crowds. As anyone who has tried to get from one side of Victoria to the other at rush hour knows, you need that kind of acute concentration of focus not to trip over the wheelie briefcases, slip on the discarded Metros, or walk slap-bang into a businessman chattering obliviously into his phone. To make it through this chaos, I draw on the memory of repeated viewings of Heat, pigeon my toes, narrow my eyes, summon McCauley steely determination and hyper alertness, and bowl like Bobby. OK, so his mission was to rob millions of dollars, lose an FBI tail and execute a snitch, while mine only involves reaching the entrance to the tube without incident, but we're talking peak hours on London Transport, capiche? What the difference? I'd bet my share of the loot that, for many of us, De Niro represents something of an ideal of masculinity. From Vito Corleone in The Godfather through Michael in The Deer Hunter to McCauley in Heat, and his similar leads in lesser films like Ronin and The Score, his persona has been built on quiet strength, absolute decisiveness, fierce loyalty, and an unshakeable code of honour. For me it all began with Taxi Driver . Scorsese masterpiece is one of those films that, if seen at just the right time in adolescence, has the power to obsess. Travis Bickle social ineptitude and inarticulacy, his ""morbid self-attention"" and retreat into fantasy, are characteristics that many young men grapple with, and De Niro portrays them painfully well. With maturity the film lessens its hold (getting a girlfriend helps immeasurably, if the unwashed plaid shirt, inability to make eye contact, and inaudible mumbling aren't causing dates to prove too elusive) and can be replaced by other, more positive De Niro roles. His Rodrigo Mendoza in The Mission, for instance, while far from Hanksian in disposition, has a healthy character arc, from violent, mercenary slaver through self-imposed redemption to (not so) humble man of faith. Incidentally, for those of a psychologically malleable bent, I would recommend avoiding King of Comedy Rupert Pupkin entirely until imperviously well-adjusted. My movie-related flights of fantasy don't stop with De Niro. When encountering rudeness or a lack of manners, I often think fondly of Tim Roth in Pulp Fiction , and imagine grabbing the offender, holding a big gun to their head and threatening to ""unload right in [their] fuckin' face"". When out walking on the South Downs, the wind in my hair, nothing but rolling hills for miles, I become Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings, scanning the terrain during those Monty Python-esque scenes of the fellowship running across the mountaintops of Middle Earth. But it Bobby I rely on to get me to work every day.",524,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/25/role-model-robert-de-niro

88,"It is a tragic irony that, in his life and death, Christopher Reeve, who has died of heart failure aged has been renowned for two roles: Superman , the supreme physical specimen, and a man paralysed from the neck down. Unfortunately, the second role was all too real. In Reeve, a keen rider, broke his neck when he was thrown from his horse during an equestrian competition in Virginia. But, after some years of therapy, despite pessimistic prognoses, he was determined to walk again, and became a symbol of hope for quadriplegics. ""I refuse to allow a disability to determine how I live my life. I don't mean to be reckless, but setting a goal that seems a bit daunting actually is very helpful toward recovery,"" Reeve said. In Reeve was able to move his index finger and breathe for longer and longer periods without a respirator. He also regained sensation in other parts of his body. Reeve dedicated much of his time and almost all of his energy lobbying US Congress for better insurance protection against catastrophic injury and giving support to stem cell research. Coincidentally, Senator John Kerry, in Friday debate with George Bush, said that he believed embryonic stem cell research should be expanded, saying it would be the best way to give Reeve (an active Democrat) and others like him the chance to walk again. However, it would be a pity if this heroic and heartrending situation should obscure some of his many achievements in his acting career, cut short in such a cruel manner. After all, Reeve appeared in a total of feature films, a dozen TV movies, and about plays. Christopher Reeve was born in New York into an intellectual family; his father FD Reeve is a noted novelist, poet, and scholar of Russian literature; his mother, the journalist Barbara Johnson. During his childhood, Christopher was exposed to a stimulating intellectual environment that included Sunday dinners with the poets Robert Frost and Robert Penn Warren, and politician and academic Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The atmosphere was such that his father was disappointed to learn that the role of Superman that his son had been offered was not one in George Bernard Shaw Man and Superman as he had thought. Christopher attended the exclusive Princeton Day School, where he started acting in plays. ""While I was growing up,"" Reeve recalled, ""I never once asked myself: 'Who am I?' or 'What am I doing?' Right from the beginning, the theatre was like home to me. It seemed to be what I did best. I never doubted that I belonged in it."" After graduating from high school, Reeve toured the country as Celeste Holm leading man in The Irregular Verb To Love. While at Cornell University, he majored in music theory and English, and spent time studying theatre in Britain and France. In London, he worked at the Old Vic. ""I was a glorified errand boy, but it was a very exciting time there. I helped by teaching the British actors to speak with an American accent. Then I went to Paris to work with the Comedie Francaise."" In lieu of his final year at Cornell, Reeve was one of two students (Robin Williams was the other) who were accepted at New York Juilliard School of Performing Arts. There he studied under the celebrated John Houseman. At the same time, he supported himself with a role in the long-running television soap, Love Of Life. Reeve almost unreal handsome looks and athletic, six-foot-four frame made him perfect material for a soap-opera hero, as later for a comic-book one. In the meantime, he won a coveted role of Katharine Hepburn grandson in Enid Bagnold A Matter Of Gravity on Broadway in of which Reeve commented: ""I had the privilege of spending nine months working with one of the masters of the craft."" In the same year, Reeve got a small part in Gray Lady Down, a submarine adventure film. While appearing in an off-Broadway production, Reeve successfully screen-tested for the movie Superman. It was the most inspired casting of an unknown in a series since Sean Connery James Bond. Reeve portrayed Superman as ""somebody that, you know, you can invite home for dinner ... What makes Superman a hero is not that he has power, but that he has the wisdom and the maturity to use the power wisely. From an acting point of view, that how I approached the part."" Of playing Clark Kent, Reeve reckoned that ""there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character."" Reeve, though he played the two roles straight without any sign of camp, revealed a deft Cary Grant-inspired comic timing. Unfortunately, the three sequels were a matter of diminishing returns and, after Superman IV: The Quest For Peace Reeve, determined to 'escape the cape', explained: ""Look, I've flown, I've become evil, loved, stopped and turned the world backward, I've faced my peers, I've befriended children and small animals and I've rescued cats from trees. What else is there left for Superman to do that hasn't been done?"" Away from the man of steel, Reeve portrayed a wide range of roles. His films included the love fantasy, Somewhere In Time the thriller Deathtrap Monsignor in which he again wore a cape in the title role; and two archetypal Merchant-Ivory period pieces, The Bostonians and The Remains Of The Day He also showed his ability at farce in Switching Channels and Noises Off Further proof of his versatility came on stage in The Aspern Papers in London with Vanessa Redgrave and Dame Wendy Hiller; Beaumarchais' The Marriage Of Figaro in New York, and Tennessee Williams Summer And Smoke in Los Angeles, as well as touring in Love Letters. Before the near-fatal accident, Reeve seemed to have everything. He was an accomplished pianist and a superb athlete. He earned his pilot licence in his early and twice flew solo across the Atlantic in a small plane. He also flew gliders and was an expert sailor, scuba diver and skier. But horses were his great passion. In Reeve returned to acting in a remarkable TV movie update of the Hitchcock thriller Rear Window, in which a man confined to a wheelchair spies on people in a neighbouring apartment. Reeve is survived by three children, a son and daughter from his long relationship with modelling executive Gae Exton, and a son with Dana Morosini, whom he married in Reeve parents are still alive.

89,"Peter Jackson has revealed he began filming his blockbuster Hobbit trilogy without proper preparation, in many cases shooting scenes without storyboards and completed scripts in a process he described as “making it up as I went along”. In the remarkably candid behind-the-scenes featurette from the Battle of Five Armies DVD, the Oscar-winning New Zealander details the radical shift in preparation time between previous JRR Tolkien trilogy The Lord of the Rings, which he had three and a half years to prepare, and its sequel saga. Jackson took over directing duties in following the departure of Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro, and according to his comments in the new video had almost no time at all to prepare his vision before shooting began and he found himself plunged into days. Peter Jackson Hobbit trilogy becomes most expensive film production ever “Because Guillermo Del Toro had to leave and I jumped in and took over, we didn’t wind the clock back a year and a half and give me a year and a half prep to design the movie, which was different to what he was doing,” reveals Jackson. “It was impossible, and as a result of it being impossible I just started shooting the movie with most of it not prepped at all. “You’re going on to a set and you’re winging it, you’ve got these massively complicated scenes, no storyboards and you’re making it up there and then on the spot […] I spent most of The Hobbit feeling like I was not on top of it […] even from a script point of view Fran [Walsh], Philippa [Boyens] and I hadn’t got the entire scripts written to our satisfaction so that was a very high pressure situation.” The chaotic state of affairs on set in New Zealand helps explain why The Battle of Five Armies was pushed back by five months in from a July release date to its final December slot. Jackson explains he “winged it” right up until the film climactic battle but was eventually forced to concede that production would have to be called to a halt while he worked out how to shoot it. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies review “We had allowed two months of shooting for that in and at some point when we were approaching that I went to our producers and the studio and said: ‘Because I don’t know what the hell I’m doing now, because I haven’t got storyboards and prep, why don’t we just finish earlier?’ “And so what that delay gives you is time for the director to clear his head and have some quiet time for inspiration to come about the battle, and start to really put something together.” While Jackson Hobbit trilogy scored close to worldwide, it was not a critical hit on the scale of its predecessor. Some fans complained over the decision to split Tolkien breezy fantasy fable into three epic movies with a total running time of almost eight hours, and The Battle of the Five Armies was the saga worst-reviewed film with a barely-fresh rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.",522,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/19/peter-jackson-battle-of-the-five-armies-i-didnt-know-what-the-hell-i-was-doing-when-i-made-the-hobbit
90,"here a jaunty rap at the door, and in bounds Michelle Yeoh. She on springs, despite just having arrived in London after stops in Paris, Taiwan and Hong Kong. But perhaps that not surprising: from her earliest action films, energy has always characterised her work. We meet in an apartment where glossy copies of Variety magazine are strewn around us, their covers trumpeting potential Oscar contenders such as Frost/Nixon and The Reader. Yeoh, is no stranger to that world. After impressing as the Bond girl Wai Lin in Tomorrow Never Dies in she went on to star in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee Oscar-winning martial-arts love story of It was one of the biggest non-English language hits of all time. But the film she has come to discuss is more mesmerising than most of the titles likely to be vying for Hollywood doorstops next February, the mesmerising Far North, directed by the British filmmaker Asif Kapadia and shot on Svalbard, in the Arctic Ocean above Norway, the most northern settlement in the world. Yeoh plays Saiva, who passes her days in the icy wasteland hunting animals with her companion, Anja (Michelle Krusiec), and reflecting on a life that has been cursed ever since a shaman declared she was bad juju. Wandering the plains one day, who should she find curled up on the ice but Sean Bean? Many women would consider this a boon. But once Bean has thawed out, his presence jeopardises the women relationship, with unsettling consequences. ""When I got the script,"" Yeoh says, ""I thought: either my agent wants to kill me or he telling me I need a challenge."" She gives an emphatic laugh. Like all her films, Far North was hugely physically demanding. Yeoh, who made her name as an action star in Hong Kong in the early to mid is probably the actor of her age most likely to be found begging a director to stuff the insurers and let her perform her own stunts. While Far North might seem worlds away from movies such as Police Story Supercop (memorable for one particularly awesome motorcycle leap on to a moving train), what they have in common is the sheer stamina each has required of her. Indeed it was the harsh conditions and natural hazards that attracted her to Far North, she says. But then it probably a breeze to work under constant threat of polar bear attack when you've acted alongside Vin Diesel, as Yeoh did in Babylon AD. ""On Far North, we were always aware of being at the whim of mother nature,"" she says. ""She the biggest star in the film. But I had always longed to go to the North Pole, and the best time to go somewhere is when you're working on a film. You can roll up your sleeves, get to know the people. That what I did - I spent time with the locals, I hung out with them, soaked them up, watched how they move and sit, with their legs slightly spread, their shoulders hunched. They don't have big gestures but their movements are basic, refined, pure."" She says that the role itself took her ""to dark places most of us can't get our heads around. We were all living together on a boat, an ice breaker, with all this jaw-dropping scenery around us - all those miles and miles of nothing."" You sense that Far North, like her role last year in Danny Boyle science-fiction thriller Sunshine, came as something of a tonic after the big-budget productions she done - from Tomorrow Never Dies to Memoirs of a Geisha (""Two-and-a-half hours in makeup - every day!"") to the recent Mummy threequel, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. ""It so important for me to do my own stunts,"" Yeoh says. ""The sense of achievement is so immense. But the studios don't want to take the risk. 'You're an actor, actors don't do stunts!' And if they do let you do anything, they wrap you in so much cotton wool it takes away the fun anyway."" Yeoh, who was born Yeoh Chu-Kheng to an affluent Chinese-Malay family in Ipoh, Malaysia, has always been interested in using her body to express herself. ""Body language is more fascinating to me than actual language,"" she says. ""Before you get into the mind, you have to inhabit the physicality. Body language is a great way of speaking."" She says she has to use her body ""to help the audience overcome the fact that they are watching Michelle Yeoh - I have to rid myself of my usual mannerisms, my usual way of moving and behaving, so that they see only the role, and don't think of, say, Crouching Tiger."" Given that she sees her body as her prime mode of self-expression, it not hard to imagine the trauma she suffered at the age of when her hopes of becoming a ballet dancer were dashed by a back injury. At the time she was studying at London Royal Academy of Dance, hoping to become a prima ballerina. ""People talk about seeing their dreams shattered, but that really happened to me,"" she says. ""The doctor asked me, 'Have you ever thought of doing something other than dance?' Suddenly it hit me: he wasn't joking."" The principal pointed out to Yeoh that ballet was only a small part of dance, and that there were other ways for her to express physicality. Although she couldn't carry on with her dance degree, Yeoh stayed on at the Royal Academy, studying choreography instead, and graduated in with a BA in creative arts with a minor in drama. It is to be hoped that the kindly principal who advised her back then has since got around to renting out The Story of Stuntwoman Ah Kam, released in in which Yeoh falls on to her head, or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where her limbs, muscular and graceful, move at such speed they are a constant blur. After leaving the Academy, Yeoh returned briefly to Malaysia - just long enough for her mother to enter her into a beauty pageant. She picked up the Miss Malaysia title, seemingly the way other people pick up colds, and went on to take part in Miss World (which she did not win). This particular career trajectory was interrupted when, in Hong Kong, she caught the eye of the billionaire studio head Dickson Poon. He persuaded her to make commercials (she starred opposite Jackie Chan in her first one) and then convinced her to sign a movie contract with his company, D&amp;B Films. Poon then completed a hat-trick by asking Yeoh to marry him. She still expresses surprise that their wedding, in was a cover story in Hong Kong. But here the strange part: having launched Yeoh career, after they married in Poon asked her to quit acting. Why did she agree? Yeoh explains, patiently, that she was entirely in accord with her then-husband wishes. ""It wasn't a hard decision because I saw marriage as a full existence. I see someone now like Emma Thompson or Kate Winslet, who can juggle their careers and their family life, but that felt beyond me then. Maybe it comes from the Asian culture, but my thinking was that I couldn't be running around all over the world, jumping off buildings, if I was going to give my marriage When I choose to do something, I always give it my complete commitment. If I feel I've done my best, and it not going the way it should, then I'll leave. That what I did with my marriage."" When Yeoh and Boon divorced after just over three years of marriage, she was surprised to find her stock was still high in the film industry . ""No one thought I'd left for good - they were keeping my seat warm for me. So I jumped back in."" Earlier this year Yeoh announced her engagement to Jean Todt, the French executive director of Ferrari formula one team. What if he were to suggest she give up acting? ""He would never do that,"" she says. ""He would never ask that of me. He very sensible and supportive. He even came out to see me during Far North. And when he wasn't there, he sent me food packages."" This is good news indeed. It would be a shame if Yeoh were to call time on a career in which she has punched and kicked in the face of so many industry prejudices. As an Asian woman in her mid forties, her every appearance on screen defies mainstream cinema bias towards the youthful, and the Caucasian. ""I appreciate I am very blessed, so I do work my hardest when I get the opportunity,"" she says. ""Asian performers have always had to fight cliched roles - the Suzie Wong type, the Chinatown waitress, the Chinatown-whatever. Even years ago, they were the only roles available. You would think I would've been working non-stop after Tomorrow Never Dies, but my next western film wasn't until Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon three years later. Why? Because no one was offering me the roles I wanted. It was still the same old stereotypes. If you look at my CV, there not a big repertoire. Things are getting better now, but the same problem still arises sometimes. When I told my agent I wanted to work with Danny Boyle on Sunshine, he said, 'There not really a role there for an Asian face.' But that the thing: I'm not an Asian face. I'm an actress. That what we need to overcome."" Take that! Five key Yeoh films Police Story Supercop Yeoh triumphant return to acting after a three-year hiatus was one of her most demanding roles. As a mainland Chinese police officer assisting Hong Kong cop Jackie Chan on an undercover assignment in China, she more than held her own alongside her more famous sidekick, matching him stunt for daredevil stunt. Tomorrow Never Dies Yeoh was an unknown quantity to Western audiences when she appeared opposite Pierce Brosnan in his second Bond movie. Her quick-witted, no-nonsense performance refused to adhere to the Bond girl stereotype of subservient eye-candy: Brosnan himself was so impressed by her stylishness, daring and aplomb, he called her ""the female James Bond"". Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon This was the one for Yeoh - in Ang Lee peculiarly tender martial arts adventure, she found a role that married her physical prowess to her subtle acting skills. Whether yearning gently for Chow Yun-Fat or trading blows in the air with young pretender Zhang Ziyi, Yeoh took your breath away. Memoirs of a Geisha There was controversy over the casting of Chinese actors in Japanese parts, but Yeoh performance as the graceful mentor to the film heroine again gave her another valuable opportunity, after Crouching Tiger,to express her physical dexterity and dance background in a substantial acting role. Sunshine It a testament to Yeoh flexibility that she fitted in seamlessly as an environmentally concerned astronaut in Danny Boyle science-fiction thriller, filmed at Mills Studios in east London. As an admirer of Boyle work, she lobbied hard for the part, which was written for a younger, non-Asian actor.

91,"If you didn’t know the backstory of forthcoming film Crazy Rich Asians, you would think it was fiction. Based on Kevin Kwan best-selling novel , the movie takes its inspiration from the writer elite upbringing in Singapore: his grandfather helped invent Chinese cure-all Tiger Balm ; his cousin is Nancy Kwan, one of Hollywood first Asian stars; and as a kid he bred arowanas – exotic fish that now sell for up to each. The “crazy” wealth is on an extreme scale: cruise ships with multiple pools, climate-controlled closets, and more private planes than cars. It also raises the stakes in Kwan story about a romantic relationship between two New York University professors. After dating for two years, Nick Young (Henry Golding) flies Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) to his native Singapore to meet his family. Once there, Rachel learns that Nick is the highly sought-after heir to an enormous fortune, and any prospect of a future with Rachel in it sparks jealousy, sabotage and bullying that involves a bloody gutted fish. But the film exotic flowers and million-dollar gems have been eclipsed by a far weightier conversation. There is a dearth of major Hollywood roles available to Asian-American actors – they are given less than of speaking parts, according to a University of Southern California study – meaning director Jon M Chu film has already become a beacon for representation. For the film adaptation, he called for aspiring actors to submit audition tapes to get a chance to play a part. “We just really wanted to open up the process, because we know how hard it is to get in the door,” Chu said in his announcement, “especially for Asian characters of different shapes, sizes and talents.” Asian actors have struggled to gain visibility in the United States, an issue cemented in when Hollywood enforced the Hays Code , a list of several dozen restrictions to keep films “wholesome” and “moral”. Interracial marriage was still banned in states, and the Hays Code forbade depictions of relationships between “the white and black races”. As a result, MGM adaptation of The Good Earth, Pearl S Buck Pulitzer-winning novel set in Imperial China, starred a white couple. Anna May Wong, the first Chinese-American star in Hollywood cinema, auditioned for female lead O-Lan, but because Jewish-American actor Paul Muni had already committed to play the male lead, MGM instead chose German actress Luise Rainer. Hollywood may have stopped enforcing the Hays Code years ago, but its repercussions are still felt. We have only very recently seen Asian-Americans reinterpret the romantic comedy, with Selfie, The Mindy Project , Master of None and The Big Sick, plus the forthcoming To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, and Always Be My Maybe. Meanwhile, the whitewashing of Hollywood cinema is a tradition that refuses to die: the many recent high-profile cases of Asian whitewashing include Cameron Crowe Aloha which cast Emma Stone as the quarter-Chinese, quarter-native Hawaiian Allison Ng; Doctor Strange, where Tilda Swinton played a character who hails from the fictional Himalayan kingdom of Kamar-Taj; and Ghost in the Shell, with Scarlett Johansson as Major Mira Killian. After it was announced that two Hollywood films would be made about the rescue of the Thai boys from the Tham Luang cave, tweets joked that all the parts would be played by Johansson. Indeed, Kwan told the Hollywood Reporter that one of the first producers interested in Crazy Rich Asians asked whether some roles, including Constance Wu Rachel Chu, could be rewritten as Caucasian. It is significant, then, that Crazy Rich Asians has been cited as the first major Hollywood picture with an all-Asian principal cast since The Joy Luck Club in Because of this, its scenes feel like firsts: you get to see how a character like Wu, the Chinese-American Rachel Chu, feels when she meets her boyfriend family in Singapore for the first time. The dynamic that Asian-Americans never feel wholly Asian or American, or like they belong with either group, is explored. “Either because the roles haven’t been written, or the roles are marginal, Asian-American actors never get the chance to become A-list actors,” says Nancy Wang Yuen, Biola University professor and sociology chair. “They never get to flex their acting muscle because there is nothing there for them.” No wonder prospective viewers have pinned their hopes on diversity in Hollywood on a single film. There is a moral imperative among Asian-Americans to see Crazy Rich Asians. “It not a movie, it a movement,” director Chu said at an advance screening. It feels as if viewers must demonstrate the demand for their stories on screen – otherwise, another movie boasting an all-Asian cast might not happen in Hollywood for yet another years. But because the conversation around diversity and representation has become so charged, does it mean that standards are impossibly high for what is essentially a romantic comedy that indulges in our fascination with extreme wealth? People even critiqued the trailer lack of browner faces, which could possibly signify Singapore Malay and Indian populations. On Twitter, they nicknamed the film #CrazyRichEastAsians, #CrazyRichMongoloids and #CrazyRichEastLight-SkinnedAsians. They protested the trailer absence of Singlish, the patois prominently featured in the book. As Nick, British-Malaysian travel host and first-time actor Golding strolls in complete with a British accent (a detail also in the book), and when audiences saw him, they zeroed in on his Eurasian background. The debate is reminiscent of one that occurred during the release of award-winning Memoirs of a Geisha – the film was criticised for casting Chinese rather than Japanese actors as leads (one of them being Michelle Yeoh, who plays Nick mother Eleanor in Crazy Rich Asians). As well as seeing a non-white cast in full regalia for once – Crazy Rich Asians centres on what is essentially a royal wedding – it could also mean further definitive proof of minorities’ oft-ignored but growing digital influence and purchasing power. Because of this pressure, Crazy Rich Asians has inevitably been compared to another recent diverse blockbuster. “Crazy Rich Asians could continue the movement of diverse hit movies like February Black Panther ,” said Business Insider recently. However, comparing Crazy Rich Asians to Black Panther does not account for how complex and deeply personal representation can be. Black Panther was cathartic because of how it violently confronted America political history, when enslaved Africans were commodified as free labour. Crazy Rich Asians, however, does not wage war; instead it feels revolutionary in the way in which Chu folds a culture clash into a date-night movie that actually features an Asian couple. “Looking at grass-roots movements and business models we can do as a community is great,” Yuen says. “But to say: ‘We need our own Black Panther,’ attaching it to someone else success, takes away from what Black Panther means to that community.” Crazy Rich Asians is on track for a US opening, according to projections by its distributor Warner Bros, (the film creators rejected what Kwan called a “gigantic payday” from Netflix to ensure it would be seen in cinemas). And hopefully its stars will continue to land big roles – Golding will next star in Hong Khaou Monsoon, playing a man who returns to Saigon after fleeing during the Vietnam war. It important, too, says Yuen, that in the future, representation “doesn’t have to be this phenomenon that we have to wait for”. “I know [Crazy Rich Asians] won’t represent every Asian American,” Constance Wu tweeted on July. “So for those who don’t feel seen, I hope there is a story you find soon that does represent you. I am rooting for you. We’re not all the same, but we all have a story.” Crazy Rich Asians is out in the UK on November The headline of this article was amended on September It misquoted director Jon Chu as saying “moment” instead of “movement”.",1309,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/11/crazy-rich-asians-movie-kevin-kwan-jon-m-chu-constance-wu
92,"It has been heralded as a milestone for representation of Asian people on screen, the first Hollywood blockbuster to feature an all-Asian cast in years. But Crazy Rich Asians , which raked in at the US box office over the weekend, has proved polarising among the community it is supposed to represent, many of whom have said it perpetuates racist stereotypes and presents a single version of Asia that is “palatable” for Hollywood audiences. 'We're part of a greater movement': Hollywood finally gives Asian stories a spotlight The film, set in the opulent world of Asia hyper-wealthy in Singapore, is an adaptation of a popular book by Kevin Kwan. The story follows a New York University professor who flies to Singapore to meet her boyfriend family, only to discover they own one of Asia largest fortunes. A whirlwind of wealth, champagne, extravagant parties and designer handbags follows. The film has been praised by critics, both for challenging the norms of Hollywood, where Asian characters are few and far between, and often played by a non-Asian actor, but also for being a highly enjoyable “glimpse through the curtains at an intensely insular world, the of the But some viewers in Singapore and across Asia disagree. In a two-part takedown of the film, Sangeetha Thanapal, an activist and writer of Singapore-Indian origin whose work explores Chinese privilege, said the film “simply is not the ‘Great Asian Hope’ that it is being portrayed as”. “While it is being billed as an Asian movie, it is made up almost entirely of east Asians,” said Thanapal. “The few brown people featured in it are seen in service positions to the glamorous and wealthy Chinese characters. The dominance of east Asia in the worldwide imagination of who constitutes the idea of Asia is troubling, especially since brown Asians make up a sizable portion of the continent.” Crazy Rich Asians review – glossy romcom is a vital crowd-pleaser A key criticism of the film is that it entirely erases the of those in Singapore who are Malay and the who are Indian. “ Brown Asians have been overlooked from the American definition of Asian for generations,” Thanapal said. The journalist Cat Wang pointed out that in the context of Singapore, the film “renders minorities invisible”. “The movie perpetuates the misguided view that to be Asian means to be Chinese,” she wrote. “So while critics and starstruck fans have hailed Crazy Rich Asians as a decisive victory for Asians everywhere, in reality, such an assessment is simplistic at its very best and destructive at its very worst.” Another journalist, Kirsten Han , said it was significant that the story was based around a specific type of Asian community – super-rich, ultra-glamorous, and extremely westernised. “Would the white Hollywood executives who backed the film have done so if it hadn’t been about over-the-top Asian wealth?” questioned Han. A review of the film by a Singaporean film critic was equally scathing. “The main cast also comprises non-Singaporean actors who mostly speak in western accents,” he said, alluding to vetoed attempts by local members of the cast to include more “Singlish”, a form of local patois. The film still does not have a release date in China , but international Chinese audiences have not all warmed to it either. Writing on the popular Chinese review site Douban, one reviewer said: “My [American-born Chinese] friends loved the film, but my Chinese friends really hated it.” Another wrote: “Starring all Asian faces is really not easy in Hollywood. Still, I felt uncomfortable. The revival of Chinese culture doesn’t mean telling a Chinese story in a western way.” But the film director, John M Chu, said the film would never be able to live up to all the expectations placed on it. “We decided very early on that this is not the movie to solve all representation issues,” he said in a press conference. “This is a very specific movie, we have a very specific world, very specific characters. This is not going to solve everything.”",672,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/21/where-are-the-brown-people-crazy-rich-asians-draws-tepid-response-in-singapore
93,"onstance Wu is all alone. It two weeks before Crazy Rich Asians will premiere in the US and become an instant hit and the most talked-about film of the summer (a sequel has already been announced). The halls of the Beverly Wilshire are abuzz with studio staffers. But here in this suite, it is just Wu and the weight of expectations from an entire generation of Asian Americans yearning to be seen. “It really lonely,” says Wu as she perches cross-legged on a sofa in white and red Oscar de la Renta, her stiletto heels abandoned on the floor. “In terms of a blueprint, a model, of doing what I’m trying to do … I don’t have that. I get really scared.” It is a startling admission, because it is almost impossible to imagine Wu succumbing to that fear. Even before Crazy Rich Asians, the actor had already served as the linchpin for a make-it-or-break-it project for Asian American representation in Hollywood in Fresh Off the Boat , in which she turned a “Tiger Mom”-style role into a surprisingly tender portrayal of an immigrant striver. The show, now filming its fifth season, is only the second Asian American family sitcom ever produced, and it came more than years after the first, Margaret Cho All-American Girl, was cancelled after one season. With Crazy Rich Asians , Wu is breaking an even longer dry spell. The film is the first to tell a contemporary Asian story with Asian American lead actors since The Joy Luck Club in Wu serves the crucial dual role of romantic lead and audience surrogate, a relatable American leading us on a journey into the heart of opulence, as academic Rachel Chu, who goes to meet her boyfriend parents, only to discover that they are the biggest property developers in Singapore – and have very specific ideas about the kind of woman he should marry. Despite her precarious position in a very white entertainment industry, Wu has never given in to the pressure to remain apolitical. (“The ones who do that, I don’t let them represent me any more,” she says of agents and managers who want her to pipe down.) So when Paramount reportedly used CGI to make Ghost in the Shell star Scarlett Johansson “look more Asian”, Wu compared it to “the practice of blackface”. When Matt Damon was cast in the starring role in the Chinese mega-film The Great Wall, she lambasted the industry for “perpetuating the racist myth that … only a white man can save the world”. And when Casey Affleck was nominated for an Oscar in after allegations of sexual misconduct on the set of I’m Still Here, she unleashed a string of angrily sarcastic tweets about “the industry gross and often hidden mistreatment of women”. Wu never planned to become a spokeswoman for Asian American frustration. “I don’t think anything through,” she admits. “I am very impulsive and reactive. I have always been a person who is kind of outspoken, but nobody knew who I was before. Now I have this weird thing called fame, and I wasn’t looking for it, I didn’t ask for it, but if you have it, you might as well use it for something good. And the best thing I think I can do is help amplify the voices of people who don’t feel heard.” In other interviews, Wu has cited Pulitzer prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen theory of “ narrative plenitude ” to explain the importance of diverse of representation in culture, but with me, she invokes a less lofty source – a famously benevolent American children TV star. “I think half or almost all of the pain in the world is people not feeling heard, people not feeling seen,” she says. “It like Mr Rogers , my hero, says: everything in the world revolves around love or the lack of it.” In fighting for Asian Americans to be seen, Wu doesn’t shy away from calling out injustice. She speaks with excitement of Sandra Oh recent Emmy nomination for Killing Eve , but also anger that Oh is the first woman of Asian descent to be nominated for a leading role. “I think that says something about who the culture thinks has a story that worth telling,” she says. Her outspokenness has come at a&nbsp;cost. After calling out Affleck, “People got mad at me. I have lost a lot of parts because of that and I probably will never be a member of the Academy … But that OK.” When I ask what it like to bump into the very stars that she has criticised, she laughs. “I love Scarlett Johansson,” she says. “I’m not blaming Scarlett. She isn’t out there like, ‘Let me go choose the part that going to make people mad the most.’ But the only way she’ll know that she doing that is if we begin a conversation and say, ‘It not your fault, but this is something that important to a population.’” The benefits of talking about it are&nbsp;clearly on display in Crazy Rich Asians, a fun romantic comedy that nevertheless had me welling up within the first minutes. A scene showing thirtysomethings drinking beer and eating street food wasn’t particularly heartstring-tugging in itself – though the pangs inspired by the director Jon M Chu gratuitous food-porn shots were real. It was just that I had never before sat in a crowded cinema watching Asian people perform something other than martial arts, surgery, tech support or massage therapy. The movie tells a story that is not just Asian, but Asian American. Chu immediately seems foreign to her boyfriend Chinese-Singaporean family when she offers that most American of greetings – an over-enthusiastic hug. Later, concerns of Asian authenticity play out in tense scenes such as the one in which four generations of a family sit around a table making dumplings. The cast includes actors of Asian descent from all around the world. “We’re not a monolith,” Wu says. “I think the one thing that we all share is not being the dominant culture of the country that we grew up in, and that environmental factor affects identity and character.” Her voice rises. “And the fact that people don’t realise that is kind of ridiculous to me. It like, ‘Oh, you think I relate to the beautiful films that China makes simply because we have the same face? You think my culture is just how I look?’ There are so many things that go into identity.” As for her feelings of authenticity, despite having struggled with the same accusations of being an “unrefined banana” (yellow on the outside, white on the inside) that her character faces, Wu seems confident in asserting both her Asianness and her Americanness. “I grew up in a predominantly white community, so there was no question I was Asian there, you know what I mean?” she laughs. “I’ve struggled with it more since being in the public eye. There are a lot of Americanised things that I do, you know, because I am American born and raised.” Such as? “Like, I wear my shoes in&nbsp;my house,” she confesses. “People are like, ‘What!? You are such a bad Asian!’ And I’m like, ‘Guys, it part of the outfit.’” Crazy Rich Asians is released in the UK on September",1219,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/27/constance-wu-interview-crazy-rich-asians-ive-lost-parts-for-being-outspoken
94,"or a film with such limited circulation, the cast on the screen is mightily impressive. Grinning, slightly unsure of himself, on assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, there Truman Capote. Accompanying him, brandishing the cassette recorder that is now his constant companion, Andy Warhol. And, of course, there the star of the show. Just in case you couldn't guess this was him, he wearing a sequinned body suit. This, of course, is Mick Jagger. The cast list - essentially comprising the great and the good of early American celebrity - doesn't diminish in its capacity to impress. Noticeably dishevelled, there Terry Southern, noted screenwriter of Dr Strangelove. There Jackie Kennedy sister, Princess Lee Radziwill, another member of the Capote party. But even in this esteemed company, it perhaps the film itself that has a more notorious name than anyone present in its backstage scenes. Shot by the American photographer Robert Frank and his young colleague Danny Seymour, this - in shaky black and white - is a film called Cocksucker Blues. In the years since it was made, Cocksucker Blues has come to occupy a unique cultural place. In Don DeLillo Underworld, a character speaks of loving ""the washed blue light of the film ... corruptive and ruinous, a beautiful tunnel blue"". In rock legend, it occupies a place as a record of the kind of bacchanalian excess - nodding out backstage, oral sex on private jets - that one has come to imagine the rock star demands as his right. In troublesome fact, it has continued to be an object of contention between Robert Frank and its subjects, the Rolling Stones. Even today, with a huge show of Frank photography and a programme of his film work about to open at Tate Modern, the film is subject to stringent (and private) exhibition restrictions. It was, of course, not meant to be this way. Having used one of his photographs for the cover of their Exile On Main Street album, and been impressed by his landmark monograph The Americans, in the Stones commissioned the photographer to make a film of their triumphant return to concert performance in the United States. Three years previously, the Maysles brothers documentary team had witnessed the tragic denouement at Altamont Speedway of their concert ambitions for This time, things were going to be different: new record label (their own Rolling Stones records), new attitude (concerts running like clockwork, not turning into bloodbaths), new Rolling Stones. Celebrity journalists would record the band progress. Meanwhile, a film of proceedings would satisfy both the desire for a record of the concerts, and Mick Jagger film-making pretensions. ""One of the rules when making the movie was that none of the people in the Rolling Stones could say no,"" explains documentary director Paul Justman, then an editor on the film. ""If they said no, then Robert put the camera down and he left. There wouldn't be any anger or anything. It would be like, 'OK, you guys have given up and said no to me. Get someone else'."" It was this policy, above all, which led to the unique quality and content of Cocksucker Blues. Certainly, the film did contain footage of the Rolling Stones playing some of their finest rock'n'roll, but this was shot by another crew. What Frank concentrated on was the periods of time between these shows: periods of time-killing, crotch-scratching and, frankly, boredom that can evidently also accompany the rock'n'roll life. There are notorious scenes - Keith Richards dumping a TV out of a window; a choreographed sexual encounter on board the Stones' jet, the so-called ""lapping tongue"" - but perhaps more representative of the content are two others. One where Keith attempts to order some fruit from room service. And another, where Mick Jagger films himself preparing, not to put too fine a point on it, to masturbate. ""Technically,"" says Susan Steinberg, who edited the film, ""it was a complete mess. There was a light leak in the [camera] magazine. Most people who saw this happening would have got the light leak fixed or got a new magazine, but Robert didn't. He didn't believe in that, and it that attitude that very prevalent in the film. It down and dirty."" An anecdote recorded by Terry Southern, meanwhile, recounts Frank attempt to explain to Keith Richards exactly what it was he was after in the film. ""It vérité,"" he said. ""Never mind vérité,"" the guitarist reportedly replied, ""I want poetry."" This, after a fashion, is what he got. Assembled over the course of the next two years in Frank loft on the Bowery, Cocksucker Blues slowly began to take shape. Bob Dylan would pop in to look at what they'd done. The team screened their material for interested celebrity parties at John Lennon editing suite. Meanwhile, every two weeks, Mick Jagger would drop by to relish the relative anonymity afforded by the Lower East Side locale, eat Chinese food, and check on the progress of what was becoming a film with its own impressively perverse logic. Not everyone was so impressed with Frank freewheeling pursuit of vérité. George Griffin, an animator roped in to provide the film graffiti-style titles, remembers the time with a certain frustration. ""After having sprayed numerous titles, each increasingly more rough, spontaneous and 'authentic',"" he explains, ""Robert shot them while walking around, swooping, and sort of discovering them within the rubble of the roof. Only to discover, at dusk, that he had forgotten to load film into the camera."" ""It wasn't commercial,"" concludes Paul Justman. ""It wasn't product. Robert doesn't make product. Whether it was good art or bad art - that what he meant."" Though supportive of the project as individuals, as an organisation the Rolling Stones were perhaps always going to have problems with Cocksucker Blues. Containing scenes where the band are surrounded by heavy drug use (in the credits, Danny Seymour is billed as ""Junkie Soundman""), as well as heavily implying their own drug use, whatever the film was - staged documentary? Fiction, as a disclaimer in the titles implied? - it didn't fulfil a helpful function for a rock'n'roll band aiming to cross international borders as part of their day-to-day working life. Finishing the film completely being an expensive process, the Stones instead paid for a rough mix and a print, and then the cutting room was shut down. In the place of Cocksucker Blues, to little fanfare, they released the anodyne concert film Ladies And Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones. The trail of the movie went cold until several years later, when Susan Steinberg got a call from Mick Jagger. With Frank permission, the pair were to clean up parts of the movie, with a view to a release. Keith Richards was then busted for drug possession in Toronto. The plan was shelved. Since then, the film has been left to work its way into the culture as a contraband artefact. Available to view only at restricted screenings - one of the provisos being that Frank must be present; the film must be viewed in the context of his, and not the Stones', oeuvre - it otherwise a famous rock bootleg item, though one with a weighty pathos attached. While the film was being completed both Frank daughter Andrea and his colleague Danny Seymour died, events the photographer would work through in subsequent films. Filled with moments of beauty and insight, meanwhile, Cocksucker Blues is left to add new depth to what would otherwise simply be a film about an excessive rock'n'roll junket.

95,"efore we get into this, I should say that my other favourite film is Casablanca . Romance, sacrifice, heroism, war; Casablanca has it all. But does it have the Dude engaging in a plan to confront an adolescent car thief while watching his landlord perform an interpretative dance while dressed as a tree? No, it does not. Like a teenager who discovers Che Guevara T-shirts, there is nothing original or particularly inspired about liking The Big Lebowski . So predictable, you'll say. Dear God, it not even the best film by the Coen brothers, have you not seen Barton Fink ? Year after year, I watch films that make me cry, films that make me laugh, and films that keep reappearing in my head for days, weeks after, because they're so good – but I've never watched anything that I love as much as The Big Lebowski. So what it actually about? The plot seems to be based on Raymond Chandler The Big Sleep . Jeff Bridges is The Dude, although his real name is Lebowski, which also happens to be the name of a local millionaire, whose wife gets kidnapped, which results in the Dude being indicted into a bluff which may or may not involve German nihilists. The surrounding cast put in fantastic performances, such is the Coen brothers' ability to condense the essence of an actor unique qualities into a role they were seemingly born to play. Maude Lebowski is a glacial, maniacal artist superbly played by Julianne Moore . Of all the Coen brothers performances John Goodman has given us, his turn as the frustrated and frustrating Walter Sobchak, a Vietnam veteran who carries his ex-wife Pomeranian around while telling Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi) to shut it, is arguably his best. The backdrop to this is a tense local bowling championship in which The Dude is being threatened by a paedophile called Jesus (John Turturro). The Big Lebowski could so easily have descended into a checklist of absurdities for the sake of wackiness. But whimsical dialogue and surreal moments are only half of what makes the Coen brothers so remarkable as film-makers. Someone once said: ""In order to be funny you have to be sad first."" The Big Lebowski , like almost everything in the Coens' repertoire, is deadpan hilarity tinged with the morose. There is a sense, though it plays out very quietly, that The Dude is a man whose time has passed. The real Lebwoski calls him a bum, the police throw cups at his head because he is an old hippy who contributes nothing, a local pornographer drugs him because he a minor irritant. The film hints, but only as an aside, that money corrupts; leaving The Dude to fight a lone battle against men who ""treat objects like women"". It never quite clear whether it bothers The Dude, co-author of The Port Huron Statement and former member of the Seattle Seven , that the world continues at a pace out of step with his own – mostly because he is constantly stoned. This film is one of the few times a director has truly captured the glass-eyed effects of weed without resorting to cliche. Is The Dude a self-contained stoner or delusional loner? It hard to tell because his exclusive concern revolves around locating a missing rug. Still, the Dude is clearly our flawed hero. The Coen brothers never forget the redeeming power of love, and in The Big Lebowski it is the force behind perhaps one of the most brilliant dream sequences ever to appear in a film. Amid the farcical events of the film, the Dude is finding himself again; after an encounter with Maude – ""Jeffrey, love me"" – he will have a very real reason to grow up. But obviously none of this is what people love about the film. The Big Lebowski is stone cold hilarious. The aggressive taxi driver who loves the Eagles. Tuturro as Jesus, all in purple and promising to ""pull the fucking trigger until it goes click "". ""Well, that just like, your opinion"", The Dude abides. ""Did I urinate on your rug?"" The Big Lebowski joins This Is Spinal Tap, Life of Brian and many more as a film which can be referenced in a seemingly endless rotation of one liners. Finally, it worth mentioning that the entire film is narrated by a deep voiced stranger who introduces The Dude and follows his ventures with fraternal affection. Sure, it a device. But it really holds the film together.",756,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/02/favourite-film-the-big-lebowski
96,"aturday morning, Shoreditch House. Desiree Akhavan sits in a comfy corner of east London media darling hangout, and does not seem out of place. Her hair is shaggy and rockstar-esque, her red lipstick sharp. Slim gold chains dangle from her neck. She looks like she belongs. This might seem trivial, but it not. What writer/actor/director Akhavan is interested in – what she examines, unpicks, takes seriously and takes the mickey out of – is fitting in. “A lot of life is about identity, and comfort within that,” she says. She admits to feeling odd if she in the wrong clothes. “Even something as stupid as that – what I’m wearing – needs to feel like it represents me. If doesn’t, I feel… off.” Identity can seem a daft thing to worry about, until you consider how much trouble it can cause. (Do you identify as British? Or European? We’ll stop there.) And everyone sends out signals about who they are; Akhavan is brilliant on how those signals affect how you’re treated by others, particularly if you’re a young gay woman. Plus, she makes you laugh. “I see where the funny lies and where the story is, and I chase the story wherever it leads me,” she told the New York Times recently. If you haven’t yet seen her work, she has two new pieces landing in August and September: her second feature film, The Miseducation of Cameron Post , which won the grand jury prize at Sundance film festival in January; and a Channel series, The Bisexual . Cameron Post is a moving chronicle of a teenage lesbian sent to gay conversion camp in the The Bisexual is a comedy about a contemporary gay woman who decides to date men. They’re very different, but both, at their heart, reveal how life can be when you’re young and don’t have an easy path within straight culture. Akhavan made a splash in with her first feature, Appropriate Behaviour , which saw her playing Shirin, a raw, self-obsessed, coulda-shoulda gay woman emerging from a live-in relationship. We followed Shirin around Brooklyn, New York, as she experimented with hookups (an excruciating threesome was a dubious highlight) and worried about hiding her sexuality from her Iranian family, and learned the story of her just-finished love affair. Appropriate Behaviour was explicit, hilarious and bang-up-to-the-minute. Comparisons were drawn with Lena Dunham (who cast Akhavan in Girls after seeing Appropriate Behaviour ), and also with Akhavan own life. Born to parents who moved to New York following the Iranian revolution in she, too, is bisexual and found it hard to come out to her family. Still, it wouldn’t be right to view her work as documentary. “It my world,” she says, “but it not me.” There something toxic in the industry, a place where women are paid a quarter of what men are paid for the same job Desire Akhavan Let begin with The Bisexual . Set in east London, where Akhavan now lives (“I felt my humour had a home in London. Also, I don’t know the hierarchies here. I’m sure they exist, but I don’t know them like I do in New York”), the cast includes Maxine Peake and Brendon Gleeson , and explores some of the same themes as Appropriate Behaviour . Akhavan plays Leila, who splits up with her girlfriend of years (Peake) and starts dating men as well as women. “The elevator pitch was always: ‘What if a lesbian did the worst thing in the world a lesbian could do, and became interested in men?’” she says. “I wanted to write the show because I hated coming out as bisexual. I came out as that from the get-go, but that word always felt uncomfortable. Bisexual sounds gauche and tacky… Disingenuous. Whereas there only pride when I say lesbian, there only coolness to say queer. Bisexual didn’t feel like it represented me and I wanted to know why, when technically it very much represents who I am.” It not just about the label. Akhavan knows first-hand how the world changes when your partner does. “If I’m walking down the street with a woman, I’m a lesbian; if I’m holding hands with a man, I’m straight,” she says. “And you see the world through that lens, and everyone treats you accordingly. Your lifestyle is completely different, the people you hang around with are different, and when you fight so hard to be openly gay, and claim that space – then having to reverse engineer it, and notice the world change around you, and the perspective change around you, that is a real head-fuck.” Akhavan describes a couple of scenes to me; The Bisexual sounds funny. I can’t be sure, though, as the series isn’t finished when we meet; so before we do, I email Maxine Peake. Peake, who seems to have had a great time on set, admires the way Akhavan made her co-writer/director/lead actor multi-tasking seem “effortless”. “She always felt like a team member,” writes Peake. Akhavan is embarrassed when I read this out to her, even more so when I read Peake payoff line: “I appoint Desiree the new ambassador of cool.” Akhavan squirms because she not always been cool, by any means. Actually, she spent much of her younger life as a very uncool person. “Not even uncool. Just invisible,” she says. But before we get to that, we should consider The Miseducation of Cameron Post . Adapted from Emily M Danforth book , the film tells the tale of Cameron Post, played by Chlöe Grace Moretz , who outed as a lesbian when she caught by her male prom date making out with a girl. She immediately packed off to God Promise, a Christian teen camp, in order to be “cured” of her sexuality. The cure consists of living among other teens who feel SSA – same sex attraction – and who are, mostly, working hard to overcome this through talking therapy, physical exercise (“blessercise” workout videos), loving Gahd and having no contact with the outside world (Post has her Breeders cassette confiscated). It a funny and gut-wrenching film, with moments of poignancy and some excellent performances. Interestingly, for such an emotive subject, none of the characters are portrayed as completely evil. “I didn’t want it to be propaganda,” says Akhavan. “Though I think that would be a more commercially successful film. I wanted the tone to be right… Every film about teens is really about the moment they realise that none of the adults know what they’re doing.” On the surface, Cameron Post is a move away from Akhavan other work, less obviously tied to her own life experience. But when we talk about her background, it becomes clear that this film, too, is a way of her exploring her own past. Born in (she has one brother, who a paediatric urologist), Akhavan grew up in New York State, some distance from the upmarket Manhattan high school that she attended. Like many girls, she covered the wall of her room in magazine cutouts: “Pretty girls in pretty dresses, like a how-to guide on how to be a normal teenager.” But she wasn’t deemed normal – she was tall and overweight, with big feet – and school was tough. “I was the girl who made birthday cakes on your birthday,” she says, “that had tissues if you needed them. You know? The one that tried to kill people with niceness. Because niceness was all I had.” When she was Akhavan received an anonymous email, with a website link. “There was a website for the hottest person at school,” she says, “and it was very popular, and the link was to the opposite, the ugliest person at school. I had votes, and everyone else had two or three.” She pauses. “That’ll shape you.” Her nickname at school was the Beast. She understands why she didn’t fit in – “there was one aesthetic, and it was: very thin, very petite, straight hair, straight nose, Petit Bateau T-shirt, For All Mankind jeans, North Face fleece” – but these things take their toll. Still, she now thinks she was lucky: “I know those girls who fit in at that age, and it was through a sexual power that they couldn’t handle. Power is a really tricky thing, it overwhelming. If men had paid attention to me at that age, I would have gotten in trouble.” Back then, however, she had no self-comforting theories. She was unhappy. She made it through school, and then went to film school, where she spent most of her time being lonely, eating a lot and smoking weed. She sank all her energies into her graduation work, a short movie she shot in very expensive Super film, then sent to film festivals. It was rejected by all of them. By this time, she had full-on bulimia. “I was trying so hard and failing so miserably,” she says. “I’d got to the point where I had no idea if my graduation film was any good or not. I had no idea what my taste was… the same way I didn’t know if I was hungry or full, because I was making myself sick all the time.” So, aged she went into rehab, at a place called the Renfrew Center in New York, where she was given a programme for eating (“diet, nutritionist, meal plan”), plus various forms of intense therapy. It was this time that she drew on for Cameron Post . “Really, it my film about rehab,” she says. “In rehab, there was always this question of: ‘OK, what if overeating is actually my personality? What if it part of me, the way my sexuality is?’ That became the question that I wanted to explore. We all wanted to be better, but what if we wanted to be better from something we could never get better from?” In the film, Akhavan identifies most with Cameron room-mate Erin (Emily Skeggs), a relentlessly upbeat girl who never stops trying to not be gay. “She really wants it to work,” she says. “That like me. I remember my first few weeks in rehab, and I was like: ‘What am I doing here, I hate every single person here, and I don’t want to listen to their problems.’ And then, as you stay a little longer, you realise that you’re staring at different versions of yourself, and what you hate in them is everything you hate in yourself. That was something I wanted to make a film about, and I wasn’t ready to make a film about eating disorders.” When I wonder if there are any films about eating disorders, Akhavan points to Mike Leigh Life Is Sweet . “I love that film. That sequence where she binges and purges, it terrifying, and it exactly how it felt! No other film deals with it quite as horrifyingly.” In addition to going into rehab, Akhavan fell in love with a woman and came out to her parents. This was not easy. “No,” she says. “It just a really, really horrifying, shameful, awful thing to say. It took all the guts in the world to say it. And also, coming out as bisexual. I mean, everyone was heartbroken, and really worried. My family was like: ‘Well, if you could choose, why would you choose something that makes everyone so unhappy and that makes your life worse?’ And I understood their point.” Now, her family is completely supportive; so much so that Akhavan dad worried that if she started dating men again, she might alienate her audience. Akhavan laughs about this. It almost impossible, when confronted with the confident, clever woman that she is today, to imagine that she blossomed from such a dark time. But she did, and, even as a success, she still needs to draw on that confidence. Cameron Post , despite winning Sundance, struggled to find a distributor. “Very few women have won the Sundance award, and it not escaping me that the one film that about female sexuality, directed by a woman, is having a harder time getting out there,” she says. “I mean, other than our film, I can’t think of a [Sundance grand jury-winning] film of the recent past that hasn’t been a major player and been nominated for an Oscar… Things are changing in the industry, but female-driven stories, specifically sexually driven female stories, are very difficult. If there is sex in the film, it has to be a man pleasure.” (Chlöe Grace Moretz has recently pointed out that another forthcoming film about gay conversion therapy, Boy Erased corr , made by Joel Edgerton, has had no such distribution problems.) Which brings us to the inevitable Harvey Weinstein question. “I think it can only be good, what happening,” says Akhavan of the #MeToo movement. “I want people to be afraid and I want people to check their behaviour. I’ve had to. Not in a Weinstein way, but because I’m so direct on a shoot, I got feedback that how I talk could be seen as insulting. And I learned from that. I think you should learn, as an adult, how to be yourself, and not be aggressive to other people. It is totally good to have a healthy sense of awareness. There clearly something toxic in this industry, a place where women are paid a quarter of what the men are paid for the exact same job. Clearly there something diseased here. And now maybe we’ll see that the work won’t suffer because of this, that it will become exciting and diverse and tell stories we haven’t heard before. The fact that the only mainstream queer female stories we’ve heard have been directed by men – that disgusts me.” She goes back to her rehab time, the six months that totally changed her. It is not as though she doesn’t still have problems, she says – “at all times in life, even when you reach success, the dust settles and there are new sets of problems, new identity crises” – but after that, “I was fearless. It wasn’t rebellion, it was just: ‘I want to make the calls. I want to do things on my terms, and I don’t want fear to drive anything I do.’ I truly became fearless. And that what the change was.” Not fitting in can feel terrible, but outsiders make the best art, I say. Akhavan thinks it more than that. “Before rehab, I had the feeling that I’d rather be dead than fat,” she says. “But then I started thinking: ‘What kind of power could I have as a woman who wasn’t beautiful?’ This is the superpower of the late bloomer. Time proves you wrong, and something that you think will handicap your life ends up becoming your superpower. All my handicaps became my superpowers.” The Miseducation of Cameron Post is in cinemas September",2480,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/12/desiree-akhavan-miseducation-of-cameron-post-mainstream-queer-female-stories
97,"Name: Agnès Varda. Age: Appearance: Somewhat two-dimensional. Is that just your opinion? No, absolutely everyone was saying it. And who is absolutely everyone? Everyone who met her at the annual Oscar nominees lunch . I would have thought the guest list at the annual Oscar nominees lunch was traditionally restricted to that year Oscar nominees. Agnès Varda was among them: the French film-maker received her first nomination, in the best documentary feature category, for her short film Faces Places (Visages Villages) , chronicling a road trip she made round France with street artist and co-director JR . Huh. She doesn’t sound that two-dimensional. Forgive me. By “two-dimensional” I did not mean shallow or lacking the depth born of considered thought and long experience. What did you mean? I meant no more than a few millimetres thick when viewed side-on. So she dangerously thin? To be clear: Varda was unable to attend the Oscar lunch, and sent along several life-size cardboard cutouts of herself instead. Why several? To include a range of varied, photo-friendly poses. Created by her collaborator JR, the cutouts included one with her holding a cat, and one where she appeared to adjust JR hat as they stood together. You know what? I like the sound of Agnès Varda. Indeed, she was arguably the most popular person at the event, hanging out with Meryl Streep and Greta Gerwig . But is a bit old for your first nomination, isn’t it? Did she come to film-making late? If she wins, Varda will be the oldest Oscar-holder ever (James Ivory, also nominated this year for writing Call Me By Your Name , is eight days younger), but she no newcomer. She was a central figure in the French New Wave , alongside Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, and made her first feature-length film, La Pointe Courte, in Perversely, the actual, Agnès Varda sounds like the most interesting lunch companion ever. Indeed, among other things, she is said to be one of only six people to attend Jim Morrison burial. Do say: “It was really great to meet you, Agnes! You’re such an amazing listener!” Don’t say: “That lovely, Ms Varda. Now let try one in profile.”",366,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/feb/06/agnes-varda-cut-out-oscars-french-film-maker
98,"he Cannes equivalent of a Sunday service is the screening of Gaspar Noé Climax, in a basement cinema beside the casino. Once inside, the congregation (all sleep-deprived, many hungover) are treated to the complete matins, a kind of prolonged grand-mal seizure set to music. There sex and there violence. There coke-snorting and mouth-frothing. A corridor is patrolled by a lumbering giant wearing a fright wig and a kilt. A utility closet contains a hysterical child screaming about cockroaches. And then, near the end, we get a sermon printed on the screen in letters tall. “Death is an extraordinary experience,” it says. The Franco-Argentine director has grown used to outraging audiences, driving punters from the theatre like a shepherd chasing his flock. But here the thing: Climax is promptly greeted by almost uniformly glowing reviews. Critics are claiming it his most fully realised, purely exciting film to date. And now, for perhaps the first time in his life, it Noé turn to be outraged. He says: “I must be doing something wrong. I have to take a long holiday and rethink my career.” We meet in a big marquee on the beach, open at the far end to let the sea air blow in. At the age of Noé still has the self-conscious air of a disreputable young thug. With his shaven head, beetle brows and cigarette permanently on the go, he like a villain from a Tintin book. But he insists he pleased to be in Cannes and delighted to be screened in the more rambunctious surrounds of the Directors’ Fortnight sideshoot, away from the glare of the main competition. “I wouldn’t have won anything anyway,” he shrugs. “This year jury is so moralistic and consensual.” Climax review – Gaspar Noé satanic dance-troupe freak-out of sex and despair Variety magazine calls Noé “an artist of scandal”, which sounds about right. His brutish debut I Stand Alone, about a murderous butcher, notoriously threw in a countdown before the carnage began, as if the film itself were a rollercoaster climbing to the top of a loop. It essentially been downhill at great speed ever since, hurtling through the harrowing rape-revenge drama Irreversible (which critics duly renamed Unwatchable), swooping between the floors of a Tokyo love hotel in the fabulous Enter the Void, and plunging towards flesh in his sex film Love. He never thinks of an audience when making a film, he says. The focus is always on his own enjoyment. When the approach works, it infectious. When it doesn’t, we recoil. Purportedly based on a news story, Climax opens like Step Up and then goes full Cabin Fever . It about a band of limber street-dancers, rehearsing in an abandoned boarding school, who make the mistake of drinking from a punch-bowl of sangria that been dosed with LSD – meaning the film second half plays like an extended nightmarish freak-out (or perhaps an artistic extrapolation of the first half dance routines). The director points out that, back when he was a kid, it was always sangria he would use to get his fellow classmates drunk. “It was my first shamanistic act,” he says. “And I was the shaman.” Noé previous few features have been lush, long and noodling, like prog-rock albums with lavish gatefold sleeves. But Climax was written as a one-page outline and shot in two weeks, with its cast of non-professional actors plucked from Parisian voguing balls and YouTube dance videos. Clutching the hand-held camera, Noé enjoyed losing himself among them, like a drunk uncle at a teenage party, aping their movements to the point where the film frame spins in circles and turns upside-down like Diana Ross. “I’m not interested in constraining human beings like rats in a laboratory,” he says. “Here, you’re a rat among the rats.” Does he like dancing himself? “Love dancing. Love the physical sensation of dancing. If you were to ask people their three favourite activities, they’ll normally say talking, eating …” He gropes for the third. “Smoking. But in my case, it making love, swimming and dancing. But the climactic moments of my life have really always involved dancing. Back in Paris, I go to clubs all the time. I forget myself when I dance.” The director was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Luis Felipe Noé , an artist and intellectual. He spent his childhood bouncing between continents, first to New York and then later – fleeing Argentina coup – to Paris. “Yeah, I was only in New York from the age of six months until five years old,” he says. “But my very first memories are all of New York. I remember my first rainbow on a beach in New York. I remember jumping on a bed in New York. We used to live in an apartment on Bleecker Street and I remember peeing on the people walking below the balcony and being told off by my parents. ‘Don’t pee on the people!’” Some critics would argue he been doing this ever since. Noé talks at length about his father, who now lives back in Buenos Aires. He and he still cranking out paintings, working every day. Noé says there was recently a retrospective of his father work at the city Museum of Modern Art and people queued to get in on the opening day. “He crazy creative, he like David Bowie. And my father always says that the only thing that makes an artist good is working. Whenever I’m in trouble – and I get in trouble a lot – he tells me, ‘Hey, just concentrate on the work. It the only thing that matters.’” I’d read that one day he’d like to make a kids’ film and he admits that this is actually a promise he made to his dad, who wants him to shoot a movie that can be enjoyed by the widest possible audience. “My own love for cinema began at the age of seven,” says Noé, “when I saw A Space Odyssey. It blew my mind. I was obsessed with it. So I wish I could make a movie that speaks to kids the way that one spoke to me.” Does he have children of his own? “No kids,” he says. “No kids, no abortions. I’m not pro-life but I’m not pro-death.” He laughs embarrassedly and reaches for his cigarette. His mother, it transpires, died a few years ago. Noé sat at the bedside and held her when she went and the experience left its mark. He’d spent his whole life in a hedonistic, self-absorbed funk. Now all at once, he found himself brought up short. “I’m more melancholic than I was before. When your mother dies in your arms, your perception of life changes. I think the whole thing is just a fleeting illusion. It doesn’t last – and if there is any paradise or hell, it right here, right now. Also, I used to have this mental disease called collectionism.” Called what? “Collectionism. I used to collect everything. Comic books, posters, records, whatever. But the moment my mother died, I stopped being possessive because you never own anything anyway. Even her books and her dresses – they had no more meaning, because they were nothing to do with her any more. I didn’t want any of it.” Noé frowns, shrugs and briefly stares at the canvas. He wants to know how many people walked out of Climax. I tell him I spotted maybe six or seven. “Aw man, no, no, no!” he groans, as if this is the worst news in the world. “I usually have of the audience walking out.” It sounds to me as if he mellowing but he insists it the opposite. He enjoying the present, living in the moment, at least as far as his body allows. Obviously, he can’t party at quite the same pace he maintained in the past, when he’d down a bottle of vodka before heading out on the tiles. If he does that now, he suffers blackouts. He can’t remember the night, can’t recall how he got home. Aside from that, he says, he fine. He lives much the same as he ever did, swaggering ever onward through a perpetual adolescence. He says: “You know what the difference is between and Ask me the difference.” Go on then, what the difference? “Twenty kilos,” he says, and laughs.",1394,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/22/gaspar-noe-six-people-walked-out-of-climax-no-i-usually-have-25
99,"nnemarie Jacir recently developed a crush on Hugh Grant. The reason? His tweet about her new movie , When I&nbsp;Saw You. ""Astonishing Palestinian film,"" he wrote. ""Have discovered Arab cinema."" Jacir laughs. ""He is now very popular in some Palestinian circles,"" she says, her low, serious voice broken by a bright-toothed smile. When I Saw You is the tale of boy and his mother – though comparisons to About a Boy stop there. Set in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of the West Bank, the film follows Tarek, a refugee living in a UN camp within sight of the land he and his mother have lost. The boy is shocked to learn that many of his fellow refugees have been homeless since He tails these men on a&nbsp;long trek into Jordan hills and is soon adopted by the fighters and their laconic, chain-smoking commander. ""On the surface, the film could be read as a&nbsp;homage to that generation,"" says Jacir. ""They chose to stop sitting round in a refugee camp, waiting for food donations from international organisations, and to instead rise up and take their lives into their own hands."" There a deeper agenda, too. ""Tarek witnesses hints of inner fighting, of rising egos. Finally, there the fact that he is still waiting to get back to Palestine, just as he was in the refugee camp. The last word in the film is 'wait' – a word Tarek rejects. He is the only person who remains on track with what he wants. It my question to my leadership: why didn't you stay focused like Tarek?"" For Jacir, theirs was a generation characterised by splits and rhetoric, who lost sight of the need to return home. When I Saw You is Jacir second feature. Like Salt of this Sea – the first feature directed by a Palestinian woman – it was her country official entry at the Oscars. She in the pioneering habit: at she became the first Arab to have a short at Cannes. Her work bears comparison to that of her contemporaries in Iran – deceptively casual, studied cinematography, realistic performances and an eagerness to push the dramatic envelope. ""I like to be rooted in real people and real situations,"" she says. ""Yet at the same time indulge in the freedom of what cinema is about: our dreams, our ability to change or escape. I always say Salt of this Sea is about dreaming. What if a Palestinian refugee could go to the bank that froze her family account [in and reclaim what was stolen?"" In that earlier film, the main character, Soraya, reclaims her money at gunpoint, robbing the bank, taking only the exact amount she is owed. Soraya is from Brooklyn and scraped together the air fare to visit Palestine after her father death. Like Tarek, she is an outsider – someone empowered by a different perspective, and a clear vision of freedom. It a very romantic view of the outsider, I&nbsp;suggest. She ponders, then nods. ""They decide not to live by this bullshit any more."" Of her two protagonists, Jacir would superficially seem to have more in common with Soraya. She, too, has ""lived in many places – always moving, like many Palestinians"". She was born into one of the oldest Christian families in Bethlehem; the Jacir Palace is the grandest of the city mansions. The Jacirs lost their fortune in the crash of the and the home was sold; it has been a prison and a school and now forms part of the Intercontinental Hotel . Her father grew up modestly, worked for UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for the refugee camps, then moved to Saudi Arabia. The family lived&nbsp;as alien outsiders in Riyadh closed society; their mother rebelled by decorating her hijab with appliqué flowers. At Annemarie was sent to a private girls' school in Dallas that George W Bush later chose for his twin daughters. She went to college in California, then applied to Columbia film school in New York. ""When that acceptance letter came, I&nbsp;packed all my things up into a&nbsp;car and drove across the country. I've never been back."" After New York, she returned to Palestine and met her husband on the set of Salt of this Sea. They now live in Jordan, following a period in when the Israeli authorities denied her re-entry to the West Bank. Her first apartment was close to Amman fashionable Rainbow Street, the equivalent of London Hoxton. ""Then one day my landlord turned up and said he was tripling my rent. He said: 'I've already found someone who will pay that.' So I had to move out."" If Jacir began as Soraya, the immigrant in America who returns east, she perhaps now feels more kinship with her second protagonist – the boy in the camp, close yet&nbsp;exiled. She can see her homeland from her&nbsp;flat. ""I always had the privilege to go back&nbsp;and forth before,"" she says, ""and suddenly I couldn't. I was standing there, like&nbsp;Tarek, looking at&nbsp;Palestine.""",832,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/annemarie-jacir-auteur-in-exile-palestinian-director-when-i-saw-you
0,"Commercial fishing will be banned across much of the Arctic under a new agreement signed on Wednesday in Greenland, closing down access to a vast area of sea that is newly opening up under climate change. The moratorium on Arctic fishing will safeguard an area about the size of the Mediterranean for at least the next years, as warming temperatures allow summer navigation across what was previously ice. Sea ice in the Arctic reached its annual minimum last week , with what polar scientists confirmed was the joint sixth-lowest extent of ice on record. This year sits with and in the rankings of ice minimums, showing a clear trend of diminishing summer ice cover and thickness, with record lows in the last decade and reports of thick multi-year ice showing new vulnerability to break-up . No fishing takes place there currently, but large ships are starting to explore the area. Maersk, the Danish shipping company, in August sent the first container vessel through the previously frozen route , starting from the Russian city of Vladivostok and arriving safely with its cargo of frozen fish in St Petersburg after a voyage. The Arctic is likely to become more attractive to commercial fishing fleets in future years, as climate change is causing major fish stocks including cod and halibut to move further north as lower latitudes warm, and overfishing in traditional grounds makes potential new areas appealing. Nine nations – the US, Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, South Korea and China – plus the EU signed the Central Arctic Ocean agreement at a ceremony in Greenland, following several years of talks . The countries will also begin a joint programme for scientific monitoring of the sq km, and the moratorium can be extended in five-year increments dependent on the results. David Balton, former US ambassador for oceans and fisheries, who helped negotiate the pact, said the agreement would change international oversight of the Arctic and help people living there. “There has been a lot of work in the last decade to try to strengthen various regimes of governance and to improve international cooperation about the Arctic,” he told the Pew Charitable Trusts NGO. “Is there more that we need to do to improve Arctic governance? That will be a key question.” Steve Ganey, senior director for land and oceans programmes at Pew, said: “As new open waters emerge at the top of the world, international leaders have agreed that it would be risky and unwise to allow commercial fisheries to operate in the Arctic before scientists have established a baseline for monitoring the health of the region marine ecosystem. By using science-based measures to guide decision-making, the agreement will go a long way toward conserving this unique environment.” The prospect of oil drilling in the Arctic has alarmed campaigners in recent years. Current governance of the Arctic is not well set out in international law, since until recently it was largely academic. The new moratorium is one of the first steps to bring legal protection to the area fragile environment. For those countries with land borders in the Arctic circle, and therefore stakes in its undersea resources, one hope behind the agreement will be to cement their claim to any natural resources that one day open up. However, the effect of the ban is likely to be, not only preventing the exploitation of fish stocks, but also the pollution and damage that would accompany vessels.",574,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/03/commercial-fishing-banned-across-much-of-the-arctic

Germany has strongly opposed any increase to the cut in output proposed by the European commission, although countries such as France have yet to reveal their position. While the MEPs’ target – along with a milestone agreed for – would still overshoot the Paris agreement objective of holding global warming to it was welcomed by the Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout. “We cannot compromise our climate ambition because certain governments and the commission act as lobbyists for the car industry,” he said. “In upcoming negotiations, the parliament must stand firmly by its newly agreed targets.” British Conservative MEPs voted against the goal despite a government instruction, seen by the Guardian, that welcomed the proposal as being in line with UK policy. The Conservative MEP John Procter said:&nbsp;“We are concerned a target, tied to punitive penalties, may be a step too far at this stage and further threaten jobs.” Officials suggested the ECR positioning could strengthen the UK hand in negotiations.

2,"Donald Trump administration is racing against the clock to rescind or rewrite every major pro-environment policy enduring from Barack Obama presidency –&nbsp;but the government will probably not be able to usher those changes through the courts before the next presidential election. Green-minded states and advocates cannot sue until regulations are final, and it could take years for the courts to rule. In the interim, the lengthy slate of rollbacks will slow progress on reducing air pollution and greenhouse gases that warm the planet, health experts say. Bruce Buckheit, who worked in the Environmental Protection Agency enforcement division under both Democratic and Republican presidents, said the first year of the Trump presidency was “a bunch of press releases”, but “now we’re getting to the point where they’re actually doing things”. “The timetable that they’re rushing toward is to try to get these things done in time so that the judicial review process is done before the end of the Trump term,” Buckheit said. Trump alarming environmental rollback: what been scrapped so far Sheila Olmstead, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and an adviser to Obama, said the White House plowed on with executive orders and regulations to ease protections for the environment in a reversal from the Obama years, even as it saw early setbacks on healthcare and immigration campaign promises. Trump officials are weakening a rule that would speed a shift away from electricity made from burning coal – which causes early deaths and spews heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They are also loosening standards for how companies discard coal ash, despite the fact that it is spilling into waterways in North Carolina following Hurricane Florence. Trump agencies are freezing mandates that new cars use less gasoline and pollute less, and they are cutting limits on potent methane gas released by the oil industry. They are rescinding an effort to give the federal government jurisdiction over more waterways. The EPA is also rejecting science that shows some pesticides make people sick. “They’re moving forward on many fronts,” said Alan Krupnick of the environmental group Resources for the Future. “I think they could well be saying we want to just throw as much stuff out there so if a Democrat wins in or we lose in the interim, it’ll take a longer time to undo things.” Jeff Holmstead, a partner at the law firm Bracewell, who was in charge of the air office in George W Bush EPA, agreed Trump rules might be left in legal limbo, but said the administration is trying to make changes stick. “If Trump is a one-term president, you may very well end up in the same situation the Obama folks did in the administration where a number of things they promulgated were still pending in the courts and the Trump administration chose not to defend them,” Holmstead said. At the heart of the Trump administration rollbacks is a fundamental disagreement about how to count the costs and health benefits of regulation. Critics of the administration also charge that the government is doing the bidding of fossil fuel corporations. Most Trump officials don’t acknowledge man-made climate change, although agency analysis has recognized temperatures could rise (about by In most of its reversals, the Trump administration argues the costs of rules were higher and the benefits lower than Obama officials predicted. Trump officials want to ignore many pollution reductions that exceed a rule specific goal. For example, Obama-era rules would have shut down coal plants earlier than expected. That would lead to fewer greenhouse gas emissions and cleaner air. But Trump EPA would count only the small impact the single rule would have on slowing climate change, without considering wider benefits. The US government also wants to consider only the benefits to the US of curbing climate change, ignoring the benefits elsewhere that are far more vulnerable , such as island nations facing rapidly rising seas. Holmstead, who represents power companies, argued that government agencies under Trump are being “much more honest and transparent”, with their accounting by giving a range of estimates to emphasize uncertainty. He said cost-benefit studies are “not an exact science”. But many air experts say that kind of thinking ignores how much air pollution shortens lives. “Costs are very well understood and they’re very well documented,” said Miles Keogh, executive director of a group that represents state and local air regulators, the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. “What we don’t do very well is the benefit of protection. The impacts are extremely distributed both in terms of who impacted and when they’re impacted, whereas the costs are very concentrated, and they’re very easy to document and measure.” David Doniger, climate director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Trump administration is rolling back the rules as a delay tactic. He said: “In some ways they are a retreating army, trying to destroy the railroad tracks as they retreat,. They can’t think they can win this, in the sense of a permanent hold off of the need to address climate change.”",844,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/03/trump-administration-roll-back-major-obama-era-environment-policies
3,"A British wildlife charity has warned that a spate of bad news stories about the invasive Asian hornet is leading to the persecution of its home-grown equivalent. Devon Wildlife Trust said it has across cases of people exterminating the European hornet ( Vespa crabro ) thinking it was the troublesome Asian hornet (V espa velutina). Asian hornets are devastating to honeybees, with the insects raiding and destroying colonies. There is growing fear among British beekeepers that the presence of Asian hornets threatens the future of the honeybee. Let tackle Britain invasive species – just leave the daffodils alone | Patrick Barkham Confirmed reports of Asian hornet nests in Devon and Cornwall have fuelled concerns. But the trust believes that fears over the arrival of the Asian hornet are leading to the misguided persecution of the native European hornet. Its spokesman, Steve Hussey, said: “We’ve had several people telling us that they think they have an Asian hornet nest on their property and asking can they destroy it? Other people have told us that they have already gone ahead and destroyed nests, suspecting them of belonging to Asian hornets, but where we’ve been able to do further investigation all the cases have proved to be European hornets and not the invasive species. “This is really unfortunate. European hornets are a beautiful and vital part of our environment. They also help us by helping to keep in check many insect species that gardeners consider to be pests.” “European hornets are also struggling and their persecution is one of the factors behind this recent decline. Other countries are now urgently acting to conserve their remaining hornets; in Germany, for example, since it has been illegal to destroy a hornet nest. We need to look after our native population too.” New global registry of invasive species is 'milestone' in protecting biodiversity Devon Wildlife Trust recommends that people be aware of the threat of Asian hornets and they should immediately follow official guidelines on suspected cases. This means not destroying the nest and instead carefully photographing the insect without disturbing the nest and submitting an online sighting report to the GB Non-native Species Secretariat (NNSS). Hussey said: “Telling a native European hornet from an Asian hornet isn’t always easy. Our native hornets are slightly bigger, while Asian hornets tend to be smaller and of a darker colour, not yellow, especially on their thorax (middle section) and abdomens (tail section).” “However, it is easy to be confused, so our advice is always not to destroy a nest, but instead to report suspected sightings of Asian hornets to the NNSS.”",433,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/03/asian-hornet-sightings-spark-persecution-of-european-species-in-uk
4,"New energy efficient eco-designs for products including fridges, TVs and dishwashers have been delayed, EU diplomats say, even though experts consider them “ crucial ” to meeting Europe Paris climate pledge. The delays are also expected to mean consumers will miss out on lower energy bills. The design revamps would have saved tonnes of emissions – as much as Sweden annual primary energy consumption – but now look set to be dealt with by the next commission, in which far right parties may be more influential . Only five energy labelling measures are on track to be approved by a November deadline and at least half of the design overhauls are unlikely to be approved before the European parliament goes into recess in March. “The measures are delayed and we are worried,” one EU diplomat told the Guardian, “We know that some of the products won’t make it but we really hope that we will have nine or of them.” Any hold-ups would impact on EU climate pledges, the official said, adding that a worst case scenario in which all eco-designs were sent back to the drawing board “would not be acceptable” to his government. This would involve a costly bureaucratic double take, with recalculations and technical specifications needed from EU officials, consultants and research centres after Chloé Fayole, a senior programme manager at the European Environmental Citizens Organisation for Standards (Ecos) said a two-year postponement in adopting the latest package would cost consumers and business in increased energy bills. Eco-design and energy labelling improvements made up a quarter of the EU carbon dioxide emissions cuts in the years to – and one half of its energy savings. The new measures were expected to save about of Europe annual electricity consumption by and introduce innovative requirements for recycling and repairability. But the EU has been spooked by the past success of UK tabloid campaigns against eco-design proposals , burying planned revamps of hairdryers and hot drinks vending machines in Officials declined to be quoted on the latest delay, citing a clampdown on whistleblowers under the Juncker commission, but EU sources told the Guardian that the office of Martin Selmayr, the commission secretary general, was responsible for it. Selmayr denied responsibility in comments emailed to the Guardian. He said: “All decisions are on the way, as scheduled by the responsible commission services in the commission Decide system and as validated by the first vice-president and the president cabinet.” Selmayr boss, Jean-Claude Juncker, promised to be “big on the big things and small on the small things” when he was appointed in Proposals to scrap or review eco-design and energy labelling laws followed soon after, and a bid to improve energy-guzzling toasters went up in flames during the Brexit referendum. Fayole said: “It extremely disappointing to see high-level EU officials sabotage Europe plans for climate action and waste reduction. Taken behind closed doors, this decision will result in huge losses for consumers and the environment. This is surely not the right strategy ahead of the European elections.” Other products at risk from the delay include washing machines, industrial fans, electric motors, power transformers and welding equipment.",524,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/02/delays-to-energy-efficient-goods-will-cost-eu-consumers-billions-in-lost-savings
5,"hortly after sunset, along an isolated stretch of highway leading out of a dusty hamlet in northern Peru , a band of five weary farmers clad in reflective neon vests and armed with traditional whips made of bull penises set out on a solemn march. The Ronderos – self-governing peasant patrols – are resuming their nightly rounds five months after the brutal killing of their lieutenant governor , Napoléon Tarrillo Astonitas. “During all the years I’ve lived here, the situation has never been this threatening. The murder of the lieutenant governor in this hamlet made us organise in order to protect ourselves,” says Humberto Gonzales Núñez, head of Rondas Campesinas of El Mirador. El Mirador and the surrounding hamlets remain deeply shaken by the murder last December, living in terror as invaders continue to seize their land within the Chaparrí ecological reserve, one of Peru most biodiverse forests. “This hurts so much –my husband was my only family,” Flor Vallejos, Tarrillo widow, says. “He was a lovely person. He liked to defend our environment, our lands, and our dry forest. The animals, he loved them.’’ Land invaders turned their attention to Chaparrí six years ago when plans to build La Montería reservoir dangled the promise of water resources in a desert-like environment – raising the possibility of agricultural expansion in the protected area. To date, individuals opposing the plans have been threatened, and last year cases of suspicious forest fires were reported in Chaparrí. According to the head of Peru supreme court, Duberlí Rodríguez, more than hectares of the area have been affected by land grabbers – deforested, burned and illegally cultivated. The location of La Montería reservoir has been a controversial matter, since it is within the borders of the protected area, going against a resolution made by the environment ministry in . The head of Peru congressional environmental commission, María Elena Foronda, says the reservoir project has not been approved by the authorities governing protected areas, forests and wildlife, nor the environment ministry. “There have simply been acts of corruption,” she adds. An organised criminal network has its hold on the area, says Mar Pérez Aguilera, coordinator for the activist group National Coordinator for Human Rights, which is currently helping to keep Vallejos in hiding. She recounts four cases of murder tied to land grabbing in the area so far: that of Tarrillo, and those of three police officers in Salas two years ago . But the crimes are rarely prosecuted, and the perpetrators seldom face legal consequences. “Impunity is a message of support,” says Pérez. “We know that very powerful people are involved in this case, and that is making everything more difficult.” The case of Chaparrí is legally complex. According to Rodríguez, invaders have also infiltrated the community group of legal representatives known as the Administrative Directive, enabling an influx of nearly new members during the past six years. Many of them do not meet the normal criteria to join the group, he says. “It is the Administrative Directive itself that is promoting the disappearance of Chaparrí; they are enemies of the reserve,’’ Rodríguez says. Etlevina López Vásquez has been a community member for the majority of her life, and was also one of the founders of Chaparrí, but says she has found herself a target under the new authorities. She says she has been insulted, that her animals have been killed, and that the new members have tried to expel her from the community. “We have been very dedicated community members, but since the new directive came to power, the expulsions began, conflicts began, our voices were silenced – as if we did not exist,” she says. Tonight, López hears familiar voices among the barks of dogs while the Ronderos pass her hut. Halfway up the road the men all stiffen and throw each other anxious looks as headlights of an approaching car are spotted. Blowing on plastic whistles, they flank the vehicle as it slows to pull over. There is a sudden, collective sigh of relief – this time they know the driver, and wave him on.",683,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/03/peruvian-villagers-face-and-intimidation-from-land-traffickers
6,"Individually, they are stories of courage and tragedy. Together, they tell a tale of a natural world under ever more violent assault. The portraits in this series are of nine people who are risking their lives to defend the land and environment in some of the planet most remote or conflict-riven regions. 'God wants you to act on what in front of you': enforcing conservation law in the Coral Triangle From the Coral Triangle and the Sierra Madre to the Amazon and the Western African Savannah, they are caught up in struggles against illegal fishing, industrial farming, poachers, polluters and miners. The majority have seen colleagues, family or friends murdered or arrested. Two have bodyguards. Several say they wake up each day thankful to be alive. They are often criminalised, labelled terrorists or portrayed by their enemies as anti-development. All are determined to carry on their struggles despite almost ever-present and growing risks. 'You will never run from death': shot by poachers in Uganda Last year, a record defenders were murdered, according to a revised tally by Global Witness . Over the past months, the Guardian has published the names and, where possible, the faces and stories of the victims in this list. To mark a year of this unique collaboration, Cape Town-based photographer Thom Pierce has been commissioned to take portraits of defenders in some of the world worst affected regions. Although the campaigns often start locally and accidentally, several defenders saw themselves caught up in a bigger fight for the natural world. 'We have become guardians': Turkey accidental forest protectors “We didn’t realise this at first, but its global,” says Turkish forest defender Tuğba Günal. “If you want to protect the environment, you are treated as a terrorist. It everywhere now.” They are in the frontline of a battle between those who promote conservation and those who promote consumption. This conflict has become more violent as resources become scarcer. Extractive industries are financing the campaigns of a new generation of political strongmen: Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, Donald Trump in the United States and Jair Bolsonaro in BrazilAll are committed to eroding the few legal protections that environmental campaigners and indigenous groups are able to use to hold back mines, farms and factories. ​'A hitman could come and kill me': the fight for indigenous land rights in Mexico A large proportion of killings are linked to government security forces, particularly in the Philippines, which is the most dangerous country in Asia for activists. Many others are carried out by gangs, particularly in Latin America, which accounts for more than half of all deaths. “All these activists did was to question the way that business is done. They had the audacity to defend their rights and protect the environment. That they were murdered for that is a damning indictment of the way the goods we buy are produced,” said Ben Leather, a campaigner at Global Witness. “Governments and businesses are putting profits ahead of people and we, the consumers, should not just be outraged but push them to take responsibility.” 'I tended to the bodies': attacked by the Philippine army The regions with the greatest natural and ethnic diversity, have the worst records. Brazil, the biggest Amazon forest nation, has the most deaths followed by the Philippines, which is at the centre of the Coral Triangle. Next comes Colombia, another Amazon nation, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has Africa biggest forest, where almost all the victims were forest rangers. The greatest deterioration was in Mexico, where the government approval for mining and farming concessions in indigenous territory has contributed to a five-fold increase in deaths over the previous year. 'They should be put in prison': battling Brazil huge alumina plant Impunity is a major problem. Defenders are often cheated of land rights by corrupt lawmakers and local politicians. When they resist, they are criminalised. When they are killed, nobody gets punished. The majority of the defenders here – and in the global tallies – are from indigenous groups and poor black communities, who have been pushed over decades or centuries to the fringes of society. Not coincidentally, that is where nature is most abundant, where resources remain untapped, where the law – if it is applied at all – tends to serve as a tool for exploitation rather than justice. 'This is a last hold-out': Son of a murdered farmer in Colombia “It almost apartheid. Indigenous people are treated as nobodies,” said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur on indigenous rights, who was labelled a terrorist in her own country, the Philippines. “We can’t allow this to continue or the people who are working to protect the environment will disappear and those who extract will rule the world. We don’t want that.” These low-intensity conflicts rarely make headlines because they are rarely black-and-white, they do not threaten the status quo and because local authorities and the companies that supply us are implicated, albeit often indirectly. 'I thank god I am alive': standing firm against mineral extraction in South Africa Most of these activists are fighting against our short-term interests and for our long-term well-being. On one hand, they are resisting the extractive businesses that provide consumers with coffee, palm oil, fish and the titanium, aluminium and copper in our laptops, mobile phones and cars. On the other, they are the most effective guardians of global biodiversity and climate stability. Asked what message they have for readers, some urged consumers to shop carefully , to consider supply chains and boycott firms and products linked with violence. Most, though, said they needed broader political change – a greater global push for land rights, accountability, transparency, tighter regulations on companies and more efforts to punish the corrupt officials and gang bosses who are often behind the killings. They also seek more international exposure and solidarity in what is increasingly resembling a series of last stands for nature. 'We had no plans for violence': Indian campaign against toxic smelter turned deadly “Something in happening in the world. Activists are being branded as terrorists,” says Fatima Babu in India, who recently saw her campaign against a copper smelter explode into violence with the police killing of protesters. “This phenomenon of destroying people and the planet for profit is not just happening in India.

7,"Death rates for female pigs in the US are rising fast, sending alarm bells ringing throughout the farming industry. The mortality rate rose from to on farms owning more than sows between according to one organisation that collects data across companies. The numbers have been linked to a troubling rise in prolapse – the collapse of the animal rectum, vagina, or uterus. In some cases the prolapse itself is fatal. In others the pig is euthanised as a result. Some farms have seen no rise, or much smaller rises, but a separate report last year found that some farms were seeing prolapse causing as many as of sow deaths. The American Association of Swine Veterinarians has created a sow prolapse working group, but their findings so far have been inconclusive. In April, the National Pork Board announced a multi-year research collaboration with Iowa State University Iowa Pork Industry Center designed to get a broad overview of the problem. Iowa is the nation top pork producer. The study, which is still under way, aims to collect detailed data from sows – or about of the nation million working sows – on more than farms across states. A brutal business: alleged beatings and abuse on UK pig farms | Harriet Grant A number of possible causes have been suggested, including vitamin deficiency, mycotoxins in the feed, high density diets or abdominal issues. Some experts blame confinement systems in intensive farming – sows will spend a large percentage of their lives in gestation and farrowing crates that don’t allow them to move around. Modern breeding practices have also been suggested as a causal factor. Industry figures largely declined to comment but some acknowledged that they are grappling with the issue. “It a topic in our meetings, both in the hallways and the meeting spaces,” said Dr Tom Burkgren, executive director of American Association of Swine Veterinarians, a group that educates vets around the country. An estimated of the US million hogs are raised in closed barns or confined feeding operations. In these systems sows often live the majority of their lives in gestation or farrowing crates that don’t allow them to get up or turn around. In this system the average sow produces piglets per year – or ten per litter at a rate of litters annually. After two to four litters, most sows tend to be replaced by younger gilts who can produce piglets at a higher rate. Mary Temple Grandin – professor of animal science at Colorado State University and consultant on the design of livestock-handling facilities – told the Guardian that highly focused breeding across the industry has led to unintended consequences. She said that one side effect of selecting for animals that are more fecund is an increased tendency toward lameness. In the late Grandin added, pigs were bred with three traits in mind: rapid weight gain, thin back fat, and a big loin. Now, she added, “They’re breeding the sows to produce a lot of babies. Well, there a point where you’ve gone too far.” “We’ve bred a contradiction into these animals,” says Leah Garces, outgoing executive director of the US branch of Compassion in World Farming . “Over the last few decades, sows to have been bred to have less back-fat – because people don’t want to eat as much fat – but we also want them to produce more and more babies. And that not biologically possible; their bones are weak and they don’t have enough fat to support the reproductive process. We’ve bred them to their limit and the animals are telling us that.” Alternatives The high incidence of animal loss in confinement systems is one of the main reasons that Paul Willis, co-founder of Niman Ranch (now a subsidiary of Perdue Farms) spent years building an alternative to modern hog farming. “I have a neighbour that has been raising pigs [in a confinement system] … and they have a dumpster, and I can go by there almost any time of the day or week and it full of dead hogs,” said Willis. When he was raising hogs at a smaller scale, perhaps to at a time, and allowing them to spend time outside, engaging in behaviours that are typical for hogs, such as wallowing and building nests out of straw, Willis said he’d lose just “a few animals a year”. Under this system, pigs only produce about half as many offspring a year as they do in industrial systems. The key in most livestock production is finding a balance between productivity and the health of the animals, said Grandin. “You have to figure out the optimal number of piglets these sows should have. One thing people have trouble with is asking what is optimal – not maximal, but optimal – when it comes to breeding.” For those pursuing a maximal approach, there are new products like the Hercules Arm, a piece of machinery that went on the market in It is marketed as “a unique and revolutionary way to effortlessly remove … heavy dead pigs from stalls”.

8,"ne morning in May, Matthew phone beeped. “Watch Sky News now. Pigs!” The footage was brutal; farm-workers kicking pigs in the face and head, jabbing them with pitchforks and laughing as they slammed a gate on to an animal head. The owners of the farm – the Godfrey family – immediately launched a full RSPCA-backed investigation. Four people at Fir Tree farm lost their jobs. The Godfreys said: “We are shocked by the actions of those involved as their abhorrent behaviour does not represent our business. We are a family-run farm where the care and welfare of our pigs is paramount.” A few weeks earlier Matthew had been working at Grange de Lings, one of the other farms belonging to the Godfreys’ company (Elsham Linc, one of the UK biggest pig producers with an annual turnover of While working there he’d seen treatment of the pigs that amounted, he believed, to serious neglect and abuse. He had some pictures he thought showed overcrowding on his phone: after watching the Fir Tree film he sent the photographs to his former manager, with a letter about his worries. Share your stories from inside the farming industry “I got a letter from the Godfrey family saying that they had shown my pictures to the RSPCA and they didn’t believe it was neglect,” he says. “They said to call them with any further concerns. I called several times and they never got back to me.” Speaking to the Guardian over a number of conversations and meetings, Matthew alleges he saw frequent rough treatment of pigs, sometimes verging on violence. One example was how pigs were moved around. “The contract says [to] move pigs at their own pace, quietly, but everybody walks around clapping and shouting. “One day [a colleague] had to move a pig into a horrible, rat-infested barn. The pig had backed itself into a corner and he stood over the pig, beating it over and over again in the ribs and on the snout with a board.” RSPCA to investigate Lincolnshire farm after 'workers filmed kicking pigs' He also claims he saw animals dying in pain because workers were not trained properly in humane killing. Matthew says he saw one pig being shot a number of times without being successfully killed: “It was on the floor … it was horrible to see.” The Godfrey family strongly deny his allegations. They declined to speak directly to the Guardian, communicating through Liam Herbert, their PR manager, and Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association. Both said full investigations, including interviewing staff at Grange de Lings, showed none of the allegations were true. They insisted that Matthew is an unreliable source. Matthew does not believe the Godfreys knew what was going on. And neither does Ash, another source with professional links to farming who has also spoken to the Guardian. This individual believes that the footage of Fir Tree farm didn’t tell the full story of how widespread poor attitudes were. Ash saw examples of violence, such as pigs being hit over the head with wooden boards. “I saw workers put their fingers in pigs’ eyes while moving them … it was just to make them move.” *** Matthew had lost his stockman job after falling out with management, partly over an injury he says he received while using the wrong equipment to detag a pig. He has opened a legal case against the farm. Both sides have their own version of events. But after the Guardian spoke to the Godfrey family about the allegations, Matthew did get a phone call from Alex Godfrey asking what had happened on the farm. He listed what he claims were the issues on the farm. “He listened to everything and wanted to hear what I had to say.” Speaking on the family behalf, Davies is passionate in their defence: “I know the family – these are good people, the impact on them has been immense. As soon as [allegations] came to light they acted very swiftly to identify and deal with shortcomings. They were absolutely horrified to find out things at Fir Tree hadn’t been the way they expected. All the farms were checked, all the staff individually interviewed.” Responding to specific allegations of mishandling, she said checking the way pigs are physically moved around is difficult. “There are very strict guidelines on how you should behave with animals but when actions go outside that, it difficult. An audit wouldn’t pick that up, people won’t behave like that when you do an inspection.” Video monitoring is being considered. But she dismissed the idea that untrained staff would euthanise animals. “That is a total breach of Red Tractor [quality assurance] standards. You have to have documented evidence that there are people on that farm trained to euthanise pigs. You would never have a farm situation where nobody was trained to euthanise an animal that was in pain.” ‘Stockmen are working … in shitty conditions’ Since the Fir Tree footage, a number of stories about alleged animal mistreatment on UK farms have emerged. In July, the Times ran “Farm animals tortured under Red Tractor label”, pointing to poor welfare conditions at seven different pig farms operating under the Red Tractor quality assurance mark . In August footage came to light from an organic dairy farm in Somerset that appeared to show calves being force-fed and hit. There is no openly available information on similar incidents. Red Tractor keeps data on farm performance but doesn’t publish it. But a contributory factor to abusive behaviour towards animals could be the impact of the conditions in intensive farms on the mental health of their workers. Farm workers nationally struggle with mental health. According to the Office for National Statistics , rates of farmers taking their own lives are among the highest for any occupational group. The risk was almost twice the national average among those working in specific agricultural roles such as rearing animals. Ash says: “Pig farmers, stockmen … are working in shitty conditions on a shitty wage. [It is the] perceived lowest of the low in farming. And I think they blame the pigs for their situation … that how I can put it.” Some believe that large-scale farming will always bring with it the risk of poor conditions. One organic farmer in Lincolnshire told the Guardian that this, rather than cruelty, was to blame. “You can’t blame owners … It a knock-on effect of being that big, of having that scale of farm. I look out the window now and our pigs’ tails are wagging in the sunshine. But it very difficult to make a living farming as we do.” Critics say standards regime is failing The revelations of the past few months raise serious questions around the current inspection system for farm welfare standards. Davies says owners want to know what is going on at their farm and says that the Godfrey family were pleased the original Fir Tree whistleblower came forward. “The family believe that the whistleblower did the right thing. They don’t want to know who it is. They don’t want [a] culture where staff don’t feel they can come forward.” She argues that workers such as Matthew who want to report their employers have options open to them. “[The industry has] a confidential reporting service, and there are posters up. If you are unhappy with anything in terms of welfare or someone you are working with you can call and report. We have had no calls to that number so I am disappointed an adult would choose to go to the media.” Matthew says he had no idea a reporting system existed and, as a new recruit in a small team, he didn’t feel there was anyone he could speak to. The industry also has food labels and logos to inform consumers about what they are buying. But these stories bring the effectiveness of such measures into question. Red Tractor is run and paid for by food producers and promises consumers “peace of mind” and a “cast iron guarantee” of high-welfare meat. But as the Times revealed, only one in Red Tractor visits are currently unannounced. Red Tractor has now said that it will bring in unannounced visits, although only after concerns are flagged up to its inspectors on pre-arranged inspections. Critics of the current standards regime say this is not good enough. Toni Shephard, head of Animal Equality, the organisation that filmed the footage on Fir Tree, told the Guardian that the public are often unaware of the realities of large-scale farming. She believes that much of what Matthew found distressing is – sadly, in her eyes – normal practice on British farms. “We are told we have the highest welfare standards in the world. But we get fairly regular calls from concerned individuals who have had professional contact with a farm and were shocked by what they saw. Workmen, electricians, all sorts of people get in touch and are shocked at the reality of factory farming. We have to tell them it completely legal.” Matthew admits that his expectations of working with farm animals didn’t match the reality. “I did my college training on a farm where the public could come and meet the pigs. They treated the pigs nicely, didn’t clip their teeth, didn’t keep them in crates.” Shephard laughs at the idea that pigs would be treated like that in high-intensity farming. “We kill million pigs a year in Britain – my garden would be full of pigs, there would be pigs everywhere if we wanted to give them that sort of space.” Names and identities have been changed",1609,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/alleged-beatings-abuse-uk-pig-farms
9,"ric Phelps steered a small, battery-powered pontoon boat over the tops of cornstalks and into the eastern North Carolina town of Wallace on Thursday afternoon. The smell of floodwater under a hot sun – a mix of oil, manure and mold – was overwhelming. Gliding across the surface, Phelps saw something even more unsettling: dead chickens, hundreds of them, lodged against people fences, stuck in the tops of bushes, lapping up against front porch steps. They are among the million chickens confirmed killed in the floods that followed Hurricane Florence . In addition, about hogs died, according to the Department of Agriculture, and some of the massive lagoons that hold their excrement are damaged and discharging a fecal soup. “Heartbreaking,” said Phelps, a manager for Brother Wolf Animal Rescue in western North Carolina, who had been hoping to rescue cats and dogs left behind before the storm. “You drive along the interstate and you don’t see any water and you think, “Oh, it fine.” But you turn off and you drive two miles close to the Cape Fear river and everything on the riverbank for miles around is covered by water. Houses, hog farms, fire stations, whatever.” Top: A flooded farm in North Carolina. Below left: There are million chickens confirmed killed in the state. Below right: Hurricane Florence dropped trillion gallons of water. Duplin county is part of a region that anchors America industrial farming industry. Here, livestock are considered inventory, raised for a nation that has tripled its poultry consumption over the past two generations and boosted pork consumption to its highest level since the North Carolina has million hogs and million chickens. It ranks second among US states in pounds of meat chicken produced each year, and second in number of hogs. Most of the farms contract with massive agribusinesses, such as Smithfield Foods and Sanderson Farms. The extent of the damage from Florence, which dropped trillion gallons of water on the state, is unknown. The state department of environmental quality reported Thursday that at least six swine lagoons have suffered structural damage, and have reported discharges. At least three of those with structural damage have been breached – the worst-case scenario, in which walls collapse. One released million gallons in Duplin county, a department spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal. Duke Energy confirmed Friday that a dam breached at one of its plants, alerting residents that coal ash may be flowing into the Cape Fear river. Yet the North Carolina Pork Council argues that activists overstate damage in order to cause alarm. “While we are dismayed by the release of some liquids from some lagoons, we also understand that what has been released from the farms is the result of a once-in-a-lifetime storm and that the contents are highly diluted with rainwater,” the council stated on its website. Cows take refuge from floodwaters on a porch in Wallace, North Carolina. The hog industry has been on the defensive in recent years, facing multiple lawsuits from residents in nearby towns who’ve found feces on their property and the smell on their clothes. Neighbors of farms owned by Murphy-Brown LLC, the largest hog producer in the world and a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, have brought nuisance lawsuits. Juries reached guilty verdicts in three of those cases so far, awarding in damages to plaintiffs. Because of the state cap on punitive damages, the awards have been reduced to about total. Following a hurricane that dropped inches of rain, investigations into the factory farm industry found lagoons located in flood-prone areas, poor working conditions, and waste-removal practices that hadn’t been updated in decades. The state responded by starting a program to buy hog farms in flood zones and relocate them. It is practically the only course of action that the government, activists, and the pork council all agree on, and it appears to have worked. Floyd dropped far less rain than Florence, but it killed four times the number of hogs: Most news reports during the storm focused on the devastation in the coastal towns of Wilmington and New Bern, but the flat area inland has remained largely unreachable by car. Experts remain deeply concerned because of rivers that are higher than ever this week. The Cape Fear, for instance, crested at a record feet near the inland city of Fayetteville on Wednesday. That water still had or so miles to travel before reaching the Atlantic and residents were ordered to evacuate Thursday night,eight days after Florence tropical force winds came ashore. Top: A flooded farm in Wallace, North Carolina. Below: North Carolina ranks second among US states in pounds of meat chicken produced each year and is home to million hogs.

10,"Antibiotics crucial to human medicine are still being used in “unacceptable” quantities on US livestock farms, despite rules brought in last year to curb their use and combat the spread of deadly superbugs. Tests on thousands of meat samples by the US Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) show that powerful antibiotics classified as “critically important” to human health are still being used. The widespread use of such drugs on livestock is one of the key drivers of antibiotic resistance, a growing public health crisis. Regulations brought in by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January banned the use of antibiotics on livestock without a prescription from a vet and made it illegal to use the drugs solely to make animals fatter, which for years had been common practice on industrial farms. The new rules aimed to ensure antibiotics were only used when medically necessary. But tests on livestock slaughtered at dozens of US meat packing plants – including some operated by major processors such as Tyson, Cargill and JBS – found “critical” antibiotics were still in use in many meat supply chains. There had been no reduction in the number of antibiotics found in samples from the year before the regulations came into effect. Analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism also shows how a loophole allows US farmers to continue to use many antibiotics targeted by the ban in much the same way as they could before the ban, including drugs previously used for growth promotion. The findings indicate that more needs to be done to combat overuse of antibiotics on farms, critics say. But meat industry representatives said it was impossible to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. The samples only indicated the presence of antibiotics, they pointed out, with no information about what diseases were involved or how the drugs were administered. All the drugs in question were approved for use on animals by the FDA. ‘Last defence’ against deadly infections Unpublished FSIS records spanning a four-year period between and detail the results of the official chemical residue testing programme at US meat plants, in which samples per year were analysed for substances that could potentially have an impact on human health. The data, obtained by the Bureau and the Guardian, showed that separate antibiotics classed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “critically important” to human medicine were still being used in meat supply chains. Rise in antibiotic resistance must be tackled, says top medic Of these, nine are classified as being “highest priority critically important”. The WHO recently warned that this class of antibiotics is so essential to human medicine that they should no longer be used in livestock farming. The antibiotics involved are often “the last line, or one of limited treatments, available to treat serious bacterial infections in humans”, it said. Overuse of antibiotics enables bacteria to develop resistance, meaning drugs will no longer work. Antibiotic resistance is one of the gravest public health threats facing the world, and is said to be responsible for the deaths of Americans each year , and a further people around the world . (For comparison, about people were killed in car accidents in the US in The FSIS data also showed that there had been no reduction in the number of antibiotics that turned up during testing. In the year before the restrictions came into force, the number of residues of “highest priority critically important” antibiotics was The number actually increased after the new restrictions came into force, to in More than meat plants were found to have at least one “critically important” antibiotic in use within their supply chains. A total of plants had five or more, and had nine or more. Some of the plants at which samples were tested are operated by major US processors. Medical experts and pressure groups said the findings showed much more needed to be done, and that meat companies should pressure farms to reduce antibiotic use. “It is absolutely crucial that these practices end,” said Dr Thomas Van Boeckel, a scientist from the Swiss university ETH Zurich, who has mapped the use of antibiotics in animals globally. Livestock treatment may offer solution to antibiotics crisis, say scientists It was “not acceptable” that some supply chains involved the use of critically important antibiotics. “When meat producers misuse antibiotics important to human medicine, especially those that are considered critically important, resistant bacteria can rapidly multiply, spread off the farm, and potentially infect people with dangerous illness,” said Matt Wellington, antibiotics campaign director of the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). “If we lose these life-saving antibiotics, we lose the foundations of our modern medical system.” ‘Vets know when these drugs should be used’ Critics say there is a serious loophole in FDA regulations to curb the overuse of antibiotics in US agriculture. The Guardian looked at all antibiotics available today that were previously used to make livestock fatter. We found most of these antibiotics can still be fed to animals for an unlimited period, despite the new FDA rules. Meat producers warn that restrictions could endanger animal welfare. “The antibiotics in question are approved by the FDA for use in animals with oversight from a veterinarian,” said a spokesperson from the North American Meat Institute (Nami). “We believe judicious use of approved antibiotics in this manner with expert guidance from veterinarians to maintain animal health and welfare is appropriate.” Tiffany Lee, a Nami vet, said vets would not prescribe drugs without good cause. “Veterinarians know the difference between growth promotion and antibiotics for disease prevention, and they understand that they are prescribing these antibiotics for disease prevention,” she said. FDA figures due in December The US meat industry points out that all drugs are FDA-approved and insists they are being used appropriately. “Antibiotic residues are extremely rare and meat is safe. To make any other sweeping public health conclusions from the residue testing data is inappropriate and irresponsible,” said a Nami spokesperson. The FDA is planning to release data on pharmaceutical sales for animal antibiotics for this December, which will give more indication of the effectiveness of the new regulations. Tyson told the Bureau: “We’ve held meetings with livestock farmers and ranchers on antibiotic stewardship and funded research on removing antibiotics important to humans from cattle production. We also continue to explore new ways to engage farmers, ranchers and others in the discussion about alternatives to antibiotics that are also important to humans.” The other companies did not respond.",1080,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/19/crucial-antibiotics-still-used-on-us-farms-despite-public-health-fears
11,"here was a barely stifled schadenfreudian glee echoing across the liberal press through this burning hot summer. Environmentalists could scarcely disguise their we-told-you-so smirks as one suffocating heatwave after another rolled over the globe, wildfires savaged landscapes from Siberia to California and broken temperature records kept piling up. But yearning for catastrophe is an ugly desire, and it is exactly the wrong way to think about global warming. Disasters always hit marginalised people first and worst, and as tempting as it might be to hope the calamities of bring new kinds of change, that desire only betrays how badly environmentalism needs to be overhauled. It is a historically precarious moment for the environment. We constantly hear dire warnings from some UN body or scientific panel that we have this many years left and these thresholds before we hit the tipping points and the whole world unravels. Despite this piercing urgency, the languages at hand are so consistently inept that it often feels impossible to know what real change might be or how to talk about it. The reflexive condescension of environmentalism that looks down on those working in industry is precisely what we do not need. Working people whose livelihoods and families depend on resource extraction have no time for catastrophism, and defaulting to that desire sets back climate justice movements immeasurably. Ecology has to speak to class directly and confront inequality with believable claims that a different world is possible. Individualising responsibility is one of capitalism prime defensive strategies: reducing ecology to just another consumer decision and isolating governments from culpability. Blaming the choices individual people make in the context of limited options and grinding employment pressures is a fool errand. We are all implicated in these extractivist ideologies: we’re all burning almost everything we can get our hands on, and we are as bound up with the contradictions as anyone. We do not need another set of climate strategies built on shame and castigation. We need something more fundamental – something beyond exhortations to recycle more – that can open viable routes to real action. We need an approach that matches the scale of the problem. There are better ways to think about ecology all around us. Indigenous communities, who are disproportionately affected by extractive industries, have the most pragmatic and compelling perspectives. We have to understand that ecological destruction is entangled with land thefts and colonisation. Last month the Trans Mountain pipeline was rejected by Canada federal court of appeal due to a failure to meaningfully consult with indigenous people. This was a shockingly positive development, but was matched the same day when Kinder Morgan approved the sale of the entire pipeline extension to the Canadian government. Extreme temperatures 'especially likely for next four years' Justin Trudeau baffling eagerness to double down on pipeline expansion underlines the poverty of contemporary ecological imagination. Those two decisions reinforce how essential it is to look to indigenous resistances to define our ecological future. A critique of capitalism and consumption is necessary but insufficient when examining the state of the environment. Capitalism has proven spectacularly malleable and agile, and it will exist long after any climate crisis is averted, if the crisis is framed only as one of climate. We must destroy the colonial assumptions that dominate our relationships with land and the natural world. More than ever, we need creative resistance and radically affirmative social visions of the future if we are to take the calamity of global warming seriously. The burning catastrophes of can and should open up new lines of urgency. But we have to resist the urge to smirk about suffering and refute the smug catastrophism of environmentalists.

12,"The social cost of carbon is a measure of the economic damages caused (via climate change) by each ton of carbon pollution that we produce today.&nbsp; It difficult to estimate because of physical, economic, and ethical uncertainties.&nbsp; For example, it difficult to predict exactly when various climate tipping points will be triggered, how much their damages will cost, and there also a question about how much we value the welfare of future generations (which is incorporated in the choice of ‘ discount rate ’). In the Obama administration set the federal social cost of carbon estimate at per ton of carbon dioxide (up from the previous estimate of That was a conservative estimate – in recent years, research has pegged the value closer to because recent research has shown that global warming slows economic growth, which makes it quite expensive. &nbsp;A majority of economists in a survey believed the federal estimate was too low , but Republicans have recently been trying to dramatically lower it anyway. The Republican argument is twofold.&nbsp; First, that we should only consider domestic climate costs (the federal estimate is of global costs, because our carbon pollution doesn’t just hover in the air above America).&nbsp; Second, that instead of trying to stop climate change now, we should just save our money and let future generations pay for its costs (by using a high discount rate). The social cost of carbon is much higher yet A new study led by UC San Diego Katharine Ricke published in Nature Climate Change found that not only is the global social cost of carbon dramatically higher than the federal estimate – probably between and per ton, most likely – but that the cost to America is around per ton.&nbsp; That the second-highest in the world behind India and is also higher than the current federal estimate for the global social cost of carbon. That a remarkable conclusion worth repeating.&nbsp; Ricke team found that the cost of carbon pollution to just the United States is probably higher than its government current estimate of costs to the entire world.&nbsp; And the actual global cost is more than times higher than the federal estimate.&nbsp; And yet Republican politicians think that estimate should be much lower . The study I asked Ricke to describe her team approach in this study: To calculate social cost of carbon, you need to answer four questions in sequence: would the economy change with no climate change (including GHG emissions)? How does the Earth system respond to emissions of carbon dioxide? How does the economy respond to changes in the&nbsp;Earth system? should we value losses today vs. in (for example) years? The team answered these questions using four ‘modules’: a socio-economic module to answer the first question,&nbsp; a climate module to address the second, a damages module to investigate the third, and a discounting module to tackle the fourth. Ricke further described the team approach in a ‘behind the paper’ article for Nature : The idea was to combine an approach to analyzing the climate effect of a marginal emission of carbon dioxide that Ken Caldeira and I had recently developed, with a climate damages model described in what was then a working paper by Marshall Burke and collaborators. My co-author Massimo Tavoni pointed out that by combining these two tools, we could produce the first comprehensive, country-level estimates of the social cost of carbon. The US is at the ideal economic temperature I wrote about the referenced Burke paper in .&nbsp; That study detailed the relationship between a country average temperature and its per capita GDP, finding a sweet spot around That the optimal temperature for human economic productivity.&nbsp; Economies in countries with lower average temperatures like Canada and Russia would benefit from additional warming, but it would slow economic growth for nations closer to the equator with hotter temperatures. The United States is currently right near the peak temperature, whereas many European countries like Germany, the UK, and France are cooler, and a bit below the ideal economic temperature.&nbsp; So, continued global warming is worse for the US economy than Europe.&nbsp; China social cost of carbon is lower despite a similar temperature and GDP to America because its economy is growing fast, meaning that it would benefit from investing its money now rather than spending it on cutting carbon pollution, at least relative to a more developed country like the US.&nbsp; But China social cost of carbon is still about per ton.&nbsp; India is the highest because of its combination of a hot climate, high GDP in the world), and anticipated continued growth leading to large future damages. The high US carbon cost is also a surprising result because research has shown that poorer countries are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts .&nbsp; But the US has the highest GDP of any country, so it has the most to lose.&nbsp; This conclusion is also consistent with the recent Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond&nbsp;paper finding that global warming will significantly slow American economic growth.&nbsp; As Ricke explained, the US would therefore benefit from a carbon tax: In the United States, there sometimes seems to be a misconception that investments in climate change mitigation are charitable acts. Because climate change presents a more existential threat to developing countries, the argument is that having historically contributed the most CO to the atmosphere, the US should reduce its emissions in order to reduce the impacts of these past actions on others. On the other hand, our analysis demonstrates that the idea that the biggest beneficiaries of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by the US would be other countries is a myth.&nbsp; Our results suggest that based on pure self-interest, the US should be willing to pay around to avoid an emission of What more, the US is very consistently in the top of country-level social costs of carbon – by this metric one of the biggest losers from climate change. So, America is the country with the largest historical carbon emissions (and thus the most culpability for climate change), is among the countries that would benefit most from slowing global warming, and yet is the only country whose government rejects the Paris climate agreement .",1035,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/oct/01/new-study-finds-incredibly-high-carbon-pollution-costs-especially-for-the-us-and-india
13,"In this warming world, some parts of the planet are warming much faster than others.&nbsp; The warming is causing large ice bodies to start to melt and move rapidly, in some cases sliding into the ocean.&nbsp; This movement is the topic of a very new scientific study that was just published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters . &nbsp;The Arctic is warming much faster than other parts of the planet and the ice there is showing the signs of rapid warming.&nbsp; This fact has serious consequences. First, melting ice can cause sea levels to rise and inundate coastal areas – it also makes storms like hurricanes and typhoons more destructive.&nbsp; Melting ice also causes a feedback loop, which can cause more future warming and then more ice loss. It should be noted that there are different types of ice.&nbsp; Some ice floats on water and is called sea ice .&nbsp; When it melts, the ocean water level hardly budges because the ice is already in the sea displacing liquid water.&nbsp; But, sea ice is really important for this feedback loop I mentioned above. Other ice is on land and may be a large ice sheet or a smaller glacier.&nbsp; These ice bodies sit atop the land and “rest” there.&nbsp; In some cases, they extend out off the land and into the ocean where they partly float on liquid water.&nbsp; When this land ice melts, the liquid flows into the oceans and can cause significant ocean level rising. So, the importance of ice depends on what type it is, where it is located, and how fast it is melting. And this brings us to the new paper . The researchers looked at a type of high latitude glacier in their study.&nbsp; These glaciers hold enough water to cause about foot (about a third of a meter) in sea level rise. Typically, they exist in cold and dry areas, where snowfall is limited.&nbsp; How do glaciers move?&nbsp; Well really by either sliding over the underlying bedrock or surface that they sit on, or by deforming and stretching under their weight. The colder glaciers tend to move by the deforming and stretching process.&nbsp; Glaciers that have wetter and more temperate regions involve more sliding.&nbsp; But regardless of how they move, these glaciers, particularly the glaciers that have both cold and temperate parts, experience surges in their motion.&nbsp; These surges are short duration times where the glacier moves a lot.&nbsp; During a surge, ice is redistributed from one part of the glacier to another region. The authors in this study observed such a glacier surge.&nbsp; It happened at an outlet glacier that is mainly of the “cold” type in Russia.&nbsp; At the Vavilov Ice Cap on October Revolution Island, the authors find it “is undergoing extraordinary acceleration and thinning but displays no previous evidence of surging.”&nbsp; The authors write, the meter thick square kilometer Vavilov Ice Cap is frozen to its bed over the majority of its area, apart from a region along its western margin where basal sliding is potentially important for faster flow . In the ice in the region began to accelerate and the next year, crevasses were observed that matched the patterns of ice acceleration. The researchers were able to watch this surge in ice motion in real-time using satellite images. They could track the motion and show the incredible speed of flow.&nbsp; What caused the rapid motion? This is an important question because if the motion is caused by human warming, we can expect the behavior to be repeated elsewhere as temperatures rise.&nbsp; Importantly both air and ocean-water temperatures could be a factor.&nbsp; One potential cause is surface meltwater.&nbsp; The top of the ice can melt, and liquid water then can flow downwards, into the ice through cracks and holes.&nbsp; This flowing water can precondition the ice for rapid motion. This fact may be a contributing cause to the motion.&nbsp; Basically, the melted water lubricated the ice/ground interface causing more sliding and more friction.&nbsp; The friction caused some of the bottom ice to melt and released more liquid water, and a cycle had begun. The researchers also took measurements of elevation to better understand areas where ice was becoming thicker or thinner.&nbsp; In addition, they studied the forces that exist within the ice itself to help elucidate the cause of the increased speed. Obviously, this is an evolving area of study and all of the questions have not yet been answered.&nbsp; However, I was impressed when I read that even though these types of surges are becoming more common, what the researchers observed in Russia was still unique.&nbsp; They describe the rate of ice loss at Vavilov as “extreme.” The authors also point out, It is startling that the Vavilov Ice Cap, until recently, an apparently stable ice cap with an almost entirely frozen bed that is almost entirely above sea level, is able to rapidly discharge such a large proportion of its ice in the ocean over such a short period . So, to answer the question, how fast is it moving?&nbsp; In it reached speeds of up to feet in a single day. It currently is sliding feet a day. For comparison, that is much faster than the average inches per day we would see with no surge events. The takeaway message is that once we thought these large bodies of ice responded slowly to changing conditions.&nbsp; But this research shows us differently.&nbsp; It shows that ice sheet can move quickly and once we pass a threshold, they may be hard to stop.&nbsp; This finding makes it more crucial for us to slow down global warming before it too late.",945,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/26/new-research-shows-the-worlds-ice-is-doing-something-not-seen-before
14,"We’re currently on pace to double the carbon dioxide-equivalent (including other greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere by around mid-century.&nbsp; Since the late scientists have been trying to answer the question, how much global warming will that cause? In top climate scientists led by Jule Charney published a report estimating that if we double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from pre-industrial levels of ppm to ppm, temperatures will warm by ± Four decades later, ‘ climate sensitivity ’ estimates remain virtually unchanged, but some climate contrarians have argued that the number is at the low end of that range, around or less. It an important question because if the contrarians are right, the resulting global warming would represent significantly less severe climate change consequences than if mainstream climate scientists are right and temperatures rise by It would also mean our remaining carbon budget for meeting the Paris target is about twice as large than if the mainstream consensus is right.&nbsp; If the consensus is correct, we’re on pace to blow through the remaining Paris carbon budget by around Another nail in the contrarian ‘low sensitivity’ coffin Studies published in March , May , and December identified two critical flaws in the contrarians’ preferred so-called ‘energy balance model’ approach: it doesn’t account for the fact that Earth sensitivity can change over time, for example as large ice sheets continue to melt, or that the planet responds differently to different climate ‘forcings’ . Last week, the journal Earth Future published a study by the University of Southampton Philip Goodwin that took both of these factors into account.&nbsp; Goodwin ran climate model simulations treating every forcing separately, including changes in greenhouse gases, solar activity, particulates from volcanic eruptions, and from human fossil fuel combustion.&nbsp; For each, he included feedbacks from changes in factors like atmospheric water vapor, clouds, snow, and sea ice, including how these factors change over different timescales, as Goodwin explained: I ran million simulations with a&nbsp;relatively simple climate model. These million simulations each used different climate feedback strengths, and so the way that climate sensitivity responded over time was different in each simulation.&nbsp; To check which of the million simulations were most realistic, I checked each simulation against observations of warming in the atmosphere and ocean up to the present day. I kept only the simulations that agreed with the observations for the real world. This left simulations, where the values of the climate sensitivity (and changes in climate sensitivity over different timescales) agree with the atmosphere and ocean warming observed so far. It is from these final simulations that evaluate how the climate sensitivity evolves over time. Essentially, adding up all of the warming contributions from all of these factors at any given time tells us how sensitive the climate is on that timescale, whether it be a month, a year, a decade, or a century after atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have doubled.&nbsp; Over the shortest timeframes of a year or less, Goodwin found that temperatures will rise by about once carbon dioxide levels have doubled, consistent with the conclusions of the contrarian studies.&nbsp; That makes sense because those studies applied current climate measurements into energy balance models, but since carbon pollution is still rising, the climate still has a large energy imbalance.&nbsp; Climate sensitivity, on the other hand, is usually evaluated at the point when the Earth reaches a new energy equilibrium, long after carbon dioxide levels have stopped rising. Once our carbon pollution levels decline close to zero ( hopefully by mid-to-late century ), the planet will start to reach that new equilibrium.&nbsp; The slower feedbacks like melting ice will continue to kick in, and Goodwin found that on timescales close to a century thereafter, temperatures will rise by most likely consistent with mainstream climate science estimates since the Charney report. We need to hit the brakes or blow past Paris In other words, we are indeed on track to burn through the remaining Paris carbon budget by and under current international climate policies, we’re most likely headed for about warming by .&nbsp; Climate contrarians want to gamble on the long shot that the climate sensitivity is on the low end of the possible range, which would give us a few extra decades before we burn past the Paris target.&nbsp; But even that relatively rosy scenario would require more aggressive international climate policies than are in place today.&nbsp; We still have to change course even to limit ourselves to a doubling of carbon dioxide-equivalent in the atmosphere. And the body of scientific research keeps refuting the contrarian case.&nbsp; If anything, recent research suggests the climate sensitivity is toward the high end of the possible range , but Goodwin study finds that it most likely right where climate scientists have expected for decades. As Goodwin concluded, some of the lowest estimates of climate sensitivity from before do not appear to hold on the long timescales",819,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/24/new-study-reconciles-a-dispute-about-how-fast-global-warming-will-happen
15,"n a blustery September day two years into his mayoralty of London, Sadiq Khan appears atop a Santander cycle to open a stretch of kerb-protected bike lane – the extension of cycle superhighway from Farringdon to Kings Cross. It may be the first time he appeared officially on a bike since his election campaign but he seems genuinely passionate about cycling and walking, and has clearly done his homework – even if some of his stats don’t tell the whole story. Flanked by his deputy mayor for transport, Heidi Alexander, and his walking and cycling commissioner, Will Norman, Khan is bullish about his cycling record. This despite ongoing criticism over delays, and a bruising exchange with Westminster city council this summer – the council he brands “anti-walking, anti-cycling” after it blocked cycle superhighway and Oxford Street pedestrianisation in quick succession. Given the time it taken to get this far, many Londoners wonder how he will meet his pre-election pledge to triple to miles the length of protected cycle routes built by his predecessor, Boris Johnson. With commuters on bikes streaming past on the new cycle tracks and pedestrians using the improved crossings, Khan talks quickly, sweeping away criticism of slow progress. “In the first two years – you mention the previous guy – we have built of new cycle infrastructure,” says Khan. “This is of a cycle superhighway. It took the previous guy six years to do one mile, so I’m happy to compare myself to Boris all day long.” Although Khan is correct (he counting cycle tracks in both directions), the London Cycling Campaign (LCC) argues he should be averaging out mileage completed in Johnson last two years of mayoralty– not least given that most, if not all, of the schemes Khan is counting for himself were started by the previous administration. Then there the fact that about of the routes Khan is claiming, are cycle quietways, some of which are problematic to the point that Johnson cycling commissioner, who started them off, has branded the scheme a failure . Although some sections of routes are good, the LCC says “just about every single quietway we have seen has major issues”, from dangerous junctions to high traffic volumes and speeds, because boroughs are unwilling to restrict motor traffic. is popular, though, even if imperfect – leaving the main road a couple of times to zig-zag on back streets – and huge numbers of people on bikes accumulate at each phase of the traffic lights. Khan seems to “get” cycling as a viable method of mass transport, and recognises that things need to get moving. “Look at the evidence”, he says. “The fastest form of transport in London is cycling. In central London there are more than half a million kilometres cycled each day. “We need to accelerate that progress. We need more people walking and cycling. Why? Our city is growing. It not possible in the future for million Londoners to drive across our city – but also the air quality in London is a killer.” He cites evidence that shows bike lanes are good for local businesses too: “The businesses that thrive and flourish are [those which see] more people walking and cycling, stopping by, having a coffee, stopping to buy something from the shop. “There a health case, there a business case, but also, you know what? It enjoyable too.” Behind the scenes, Khan team have delivered the mayor transport strategy, and a massive restructuring of TfL; they have a new and passionate deputy mayor for transport in Heidi Alexander. Khan has doubled cycling funds compared with the previous mayor, he introduced a T-charge , plans to introduce an ultra low emissions zone and next year there will be a permit scheme to start phasing the most dangerous lorries off London roads. Khan knows that boroughs, who control of London roads, are crucial in the success or failure of schemes – they have the power to veto schemes they don’t want, even if they have benefits for London as a whole. He talks of working with a “coalition of the willing” – boroughs such as Camden and Islington who helped deliver Then there are those who aren’t willing. “We’ve got to work with those who want to work with us, but it is frustrating some councils seem to be anti-walking and cycling,” he says. “What I’ve said to Westminster is, we’ve spent the last two years working with you, been to many, many meetings, spent millions of pounds working with you, on a scheme you approved. At the hour you did a U-turn; it now up to you to come to me with a scheme.” Khan wouldn’t be drawn on the use of GLA Act powers, that reportedly permit a mayor to seize control of a borough roads for strategic schemes , but called on Londoners to put pressure on councils “to do right by our city”. If they won’t listen to the mayor, perhaps they’ll listen to their voters – or risk voters electing someone who will listen. In the meantime there plenty for his team to get on with. got support in consultation almost a year ago. Around the same time had support in consultation. Khan says they’re working on cycling corridors , and in January City Hall announced six were entering the design stage, although consultations have not yet started. The LCC, among others, has expressed frustration at the long delays between each stage of development. It great to see completion of and it encouraging to see Khan enthused and informed on cycling. But if he wants to succeed, he’ll have to walk the walk – which means stepping up the pace.",948,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/sep/21/sadiq-khan-says-hes-better-than-boris-on-cycling-but-do-his-claims-add-up
16,"One day in an American economist named Daniel Ellsberg stumbled across a piece of paper with apocalyptic implications. Ellsberg, who was advising the US government on its secret nuclear war plans, had discovered a document that contained an official estimate of the death toll in a preemptive “first strike” on China and the Soviet Union: million in those countries, and double that globally. Ellsberg was troubled that such a plan existed; years later, he tried to leak the details of nuclear annihilation to the public. Although his attempt failed, Ellsberg would become famous instead for leaking what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers – the US government secret history of its military intervention in Vietnam. America amoral military planning during the Cold War echoes the hubris exhibited by another cast of characters gambling with the fate of humanity. Recently, secret documents have been unearthed detailing what the energy industry knew about the links between their products and global warming. But, unlike the government nuclear plans, what the industry detailed was put into action. In the oil companies like Exxon and Shell carried out internal assessments of the carbon dioxide released by fossil fuels, and forecast the planetary consequences of these emissions. In for example, Exxon predicted that by about CO levels would reach around parts per million – double the preindustrial level – and that this would push the planet average temperatures up by about over then-current levels (and even more compared to pre-industrial levels). Later that decade, in an internal report by Shell projected similar effects but also found that CO could double even earlier, by Privately, these companies did not dispute the links between their products, global warming, and ecological calamity. On the contrary, their research confirmed the connections. Shell assessment foresaw a one-meter sea-level rise, and noted that warming could also fuel disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, resulting in a worldwide rise in sea level of “five to six meters.” That would be enough to inundate entire low-lying countries. Shell analysts also warned of the “disappearance of specific ecosystems or habitat destruction,” predicted an increase in “runoff, destructive floods, and inundation of low-lying farmland,” and said that “new sources of freshwater would be required” to compensate for changes in precipitation. Global changes in air temperature would also “drastically change the way people live and work.” All told, Shell concluded, “the changes may be the greatest in recorded history.” For its part, Exxon warned of “potentially catastrophic events that must be considered.” Like Shell experts, Exxon scientists predicted devastating sea-level rise, and warned that the American Midwest and other parts of the world could become desert-like. Looking on the bright side, the company expressed its confidence that “this problem is not as significant to mankind as a nuclear holocaust or world famine.” The documents make for frightening reading. And the effect is all the more chilling in view of the oil giants’ refusal to warn the public about the damage that their own researchers predicted. Shell report, marked “confidential,” was first disclosed by a Dutch news organization earlier this year. Exxon study was not intended for external distribution, either; it was leaked in . Nor did the companies ever take responsibility for their products. In Shell study, the firm argued that the “main burden” of addressing climate change rests not with the energy industry, but with governments and consumers. That argument might have made sense if oil executives, including those from Exxon and Shell, had not later lied about climate change and actively prevented governments from enacting clean-energy policies. Although the details of global warming were foreign to most people in the among the few who had a better idea than most were the companies contributing the most to it. Despite scientific uncertainties, the bottom line was this: oil firms recognized that their products added CO to the atmosphere, understood that this would lead to warming, and calculated the likely consequences. And then they chose to accept those risks on our behalf, at our expense, and without our knowledge. The catastrophic nuclear war plans that Ellsberg saw in the were a Sword of Damocles that fortunately never fell. But the oil industry secret climate change predictions are becoming reality, and not by accident. Fossil-fuel producers willfully drove us toward the grim future they feared by promoting their products, lying about the effects, and aggressively defending their share of the energy market. As the world warms, the building blocks of our planet – its ice sheets, forests, and atmospheric and ocean currents – are being altered beyond repair. Who has the right to foresee such damage and then choose to fulfill the prophecy? Although war planners and fossil-fuel companies had the arrogance to decide what level of devastation was appropriate for humanity, only Big Oil had the temerity to follow through. That, of course, is one time too many. Benjamin Franta, a former research fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, is a doctoral candidate at Stanford University, where his research focuses on the history of climate science and politics.

17,"Autumn colour is perhaps the most striking of nature seasonal displays, but the vividness of the annual spectacle is largely dependent on good environmental conditions. This year, following a fine summer and with an Indian summer predicted, we look to be on course for a dazzling display that could trump recent years and extend well into November. Shorter daylight hours and colder nights are what trigger leaf drop – or senescence – but frost, like rain, can damage leaves and cause early leaf fall. Plenty of sunshine is needed to encourage concentrations of colour pigments which help to intensify leaf colour. cold spring and hot summer will have helped ready the leaves for a beautiful autumn display, but it also hinges on what the weather does now. If it cools and we get cold nights, that will contribute to good leaf colour. Autumn bulbs have also had a good baking in the sun and are giving a fine display this year. The cold spring also held back flowering which means fruit has set, so many hedges are looking colourful with berries. The long hot summer has also resulted in a “fake fall”, where plants such as elderberries yellow and drop because of extreme summer stress. But we’re unlikely to see a real flurry of colour before mid to late October, although the impact of climate change means it has happened later in recent years. The process of plants transitioning into shades of reds, yellows and oranges is hotly anticipated by gardeners and dedicated “leaf peepers” around the world. It said to be worth a staggering to the US state of Wisconsin alone. It might seem counterintuitive that while we prepare to reacquaint with jumpers, gloves and woolly hats, trees are preparing to shed this year leaves, something known as leaf senescence. Here why. Leaf senescence is an “altruistic death” allowing the degradation and redistribution of nutrients produced during growth back to other parts of the plant. This strategy evolved to maximise the fitness and survival of the plant. Leaf senescence is highly complex, involving multiple genes and numerous biological, chemical and physical processes. And at the heart of it all is a pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is what gives leaves their green colour, absorbing and reflecting different hues from the colour light spectrum, as seen in a rainbow. In leaves it absorbs mainly red and blue light, reflecting green, and it is this reflection that makes leaves appear green to the human eye. But as well as providing a lustrous green sheen, chlorophyll is also an essential component of photosynthesis, which is arguably the single most important chemical process on our planet. Using energy from sunlight, chlorophyll strips electrons from water molecules, which then convert carbon dioxide into carbon compounds and produce oxygen, which is essential for life on earth. In autumn, chlorophyll, mainly in deciduous plants, is slowly broken down and reabsorbed by the plant, diminishing the green colour of the leaves. It is this reabsorption that ensures they spring back to life the following year. As chlorophyll is broken down, pigments called carotenoids and flavonoids are revealed and it is these, again, through the absorption and reflection of different colours from the light spectrum, that are responsible for the yellow and orange hues of leaves. Sugar concentration in the leaves also increases anthocyanin production, which causes some leaves to turn a shade of red. Sweet gum and acers can almost always be relied upon for good colour but some trees, including alders, show little change. What tends to make the difference in gardens is the reaction of our more proliferate native trees, such as oak, and whether they take on stronger yellows or more placid browns. Back on ground level, late flowering bulbs like nerines and crocus are also giving a bold display having benefitted from a good baking this summer. Although autumn colour is largely beyond the control of gardeners, you can increase the probability of good results by maintaining healthy plants and buying cultivars well known for their hues and all-important pigments.

18,"he familiar phrase “the wrong kind of snow” was originally used as an excuse for severe disruption on British Rail in the winter. A very small amount of unusually soft and powdery snow had found its way into the electrical systems of locomotives, causing short circuits and engine failure. It now seems that with climate change we are getting the wrong kind of rain – the sort that causes flooding. Europe has been suffering an increasing number of floods, and predicting where and when they will occur is important in reducing the damage they inflict on people and property. There are apparently three kinds: flash floods caused by sudden downpours; floods brought on by days of steady rain causing rivers to burst their banks; and floods following snow melt. The good news is that difficulties caused by a sudden thaw, which brought such devastation to Britain after the great freeze of , is less of a threat now because heavy snow is such a rarity. However, instead of the steady drizzle that the UK once experienced at any season, the country now has a seasonal mixture of cloudbursts and spells of heavy rain. This, plus the extra hard surfaces being constantly added to ever-larger urban areas, makes other flooding much more likely.",212,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/03/weatherwatch-climate-change-will-bring-more-floods-can-we-predict-them
19,"any people say that ants can forecast rain, building their nests higher or using different nest materials, even though there is not a shred of evidence that they can actually predict any rain. What is certain is that many ants in flood-prone areas use ingenious ways of coping with far too much water. Some build walls of earth and twigs around their nests to prevent flooding, and other species block the entrance to their nests using stones, dirt or twigs, some even pressing their heads together to block up entrance holes. Australian mangrove ants ( Polyrhachis sokolova ) live in dense mangroves that flood regularly, and they build nests of mud with sealed pockets of air to prevent water invading the nests. Fire ants ( Solenopsis invicta ) escape floods altogether by going rafting – they pack thousands of their tiny bodies tight together by grasping each other legs, forming a living raft that can float away on water for weeks in the hope of finding somewhere dry. Perhaps most enterprising of all, bamboo ants ( Cataulacus muticus ) keep dry by drinking any rainwater seeping inside their bamboo nests. Crowds of ants then go outside and jettison the water by urinating en masse – what is called “communal peeing”.",210,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/01/weatherwatch-ants-use-ingenious-ways-to-escape-flooding
20,"Trapped in a cage and shot at close range, the badger takes almost a minute to die. Covert footage published online by the Observer , the first to be shared publicly, shows the main method of dispatching Britain largest indigenous carnivore as part of a controversial cull now being expanded by the environment secretary, Michael Gove , which farmers insist is vital to curb the spread of TB in cattle. Taken in Cumbria by the Hunt Investigation Team, it has been released by animal rights groups for maximum political effect ahead of the Conservative party conference, as Gove considers a key report on the government TB eradication strategy. Animal rights activists said the footage raised questions about how the cull works. “The brutal slaughter of tens of thousands of badgers in the biggest destruction of a protected species in living memory is a national disgrace,” said Dominic Dyer, CEO of the Badger Trust. “This war on wildlife has been carried out in secrecy by poorly paid contractors with no independent monitoring or concern for animal welfare or public safety. The film footage that has emerged from Cumbria is the first time we have seen evidence of cull contractors at work. It clearly shows a badger taking over seconds to die after being shot in a cage, and contractors removing it from the site without bagging and sealing the carcass in line with government TB biosecurity guidelines.” The trust estimates that the government may have licensed the killing of more than badgers by the end of the year, at a cost of tens of millions of pounds. It claims that once all the Whitehall administration, equipment, storage, training, monitoring, policing and legal costs are taken into account, the cost of cage trapping and shooting a badger is more than per animal. In comparison, the cost of cage trapping, vaccinating and releasing a badger is less than per animal, the trust says. The Zoological Society of London has also come out against the cull . It says that while badgers can and do transmit TB to cattle, most herds acquire the disease from other cattle. It also argues that culling increases TB transmission within badger populations and spreads the disease to new areas, and backs the trust argument that badger vaccination is a much more promising tool for TB eradication. But the government claims reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB have been recorded in Gloucestershire and Somerset following the completion of licensed four-year badger culls. It published data earlier this month – disputed by some animal rights groups – which it says shows that in the Gloucestershire cull area, TB incidence has fallen from before culling started to in year four of the cull, while in Somerset it has reduced from to A spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union said a cull was crucial: “More than cattle were slaughtered last year in England because of this devastating disease and more than farms that had previously been clear of the disease were affected by it. The NFU has always supported a comprehensive and proportionate eradication strategy, which balances disease-control measures with business sustainability. “We must have every option available to us to tackle TB – including cattle testing, cattle movement restrictions, biosecurity advice, vaccination and control of the disease in wildlife.” The government chief vet has said that taking action to prevent TB infection of cattle by badger populations is an essential part of the government strategy to eradicate the disease in England, and that badger control is currently the best option available. Of the badgers killed to date, about have been tested for TB and less than have been found to have the disease. Gove recently approved new badger cull licences in England in bringing the total in operation to A review of the government bovine TB strategy carried out by Sir Charles Godfray, a population biologist and fellow of the Royal Society, was delivered to Gove last week and will be published shortly. A spokesman for the Hunt Investigation Team defended its decision to use covert video surveillance. “Our team have been active protecting badgers in multiple cull zones. In areas we could not actively defend, we placed hidden cameras in order to evidence malpractice and cruelty associated with the cull. Badgers are paying the price for a disease in cattle that is caused by human mismanagement.”",727,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/30/covert-footage-reveals-cruelty-of-badger-culls

22,"f you don’t fully appreciate the complexity of rural communities, farmer Peter Schmidt is not the sort of bloke you would be expecting in the Mulga Lands. His place is hectares – acres in the old money – and his family have been there since his grandfather selected blocks in the The closest town is Wyandra, a blip on the highway on the way to Cunnamulla from Charleville – a drive that reveals the disused fences of smaller blocks long abandoned as unsustainable. Schmidt though is still at his homestead at Alawoona, its sheds and outbuildings surrounded by a metre-high levee, standing like a bad joke in their sixth year of drought. He put it in after the flood, which washed a foot of water through his house. Problem is, that flood heralded the start of the dry and it pretty much hasn’t rained since. He jokes with station hand Joe that he cursed the place and might have to break the levee to bring on the rain. But far from being a man of superstition, Schmidt is a rural scientist, with two masters degrees – one each in rural education and cattle behaviour. He has a softly spoken manner and a sense of humour born in the Mulga. “We’re mad here, we are in the most unreliable area, the most unreliable climate in the most unreliable continent,” he says. “Well, it unreliably reliable,” says his partner, Kathryn. ‘Dry eight years in a row’ Schmidt first started thinking about climate change after seeing a program on the astronaut Neil Armstrong who, before he went to space, thought the earth atmosphere was like the peel of an orange. In the pictures of space, Schmidt could see that the thickness of the atmosphere was more like an onion skin, and it stayed with him. “I kept that in the back of my mind and then you hear things like there a million new cars put on the road every year in Australia belching out exhaust fumes – and these coal-fired things – something has to happen in that very confined space of the atmosphere. I think it happening.” It is the middle of winter when we drop in, and though the fine day stretches over the place like a shroud, there is a chilly wind that blows through the mulga. Schmidt welcomes us into a small closed kitchen as he loads some old gidgee ( Acacia cambagei or stinking wattle) into the wood stove and offers us a coffee. Schmidt has lived through many droughts but it the big ones he remembers – While southern Australia suffered through the Millennium drought during the noughties, up in the Mulga Lands, Schmidt says it was “dry for eight years in a row”. Every one is different but this time Schmidt has noticed one change from previous droughts has been the higher temperature. “The essential thing was there were two or three periods there where the temperature was above for days in a row and it just sapped all the moisture out of the soil,” Schmidt says. “That the difference between this drought and the others.” He had on the backblocks of his place last November, in March and very little since then. It doesn’t stop with one rainfall Drought has long been a part of the Australian climate and features in Indigenous stories and history. Indigenous agricultural and land management practices, documented by historians such as Bruce Pascoe and Bill Gammage, consider drought as a subjective notion – that is, it a state of mind. This is replicated among today landholders, reflected back in comments like these: “the only thing we know about drought is that it will end”. That is, it is a period that needs to be managed, like any other. We will explore more of this thinking about drought in the last of this series. Then there is the scientific definition of drought. According to the Bureau of Meterology , drought is serious or severe rainfall deficiency – essentially a period of prolonged dryness. By this measure, south-west Queensland has experienced almost seven years of dry times. Yet when Guardian Australia visited the region, locals were keen to reject some commonly held assumptions. Drought is not uniform. Parts of Queensland have been in drought for seven years but it does not mean those communities have not had any rain. Drought doesn’t stop with one rainfall. Even in NSW, which is drought-declared, some areas are not strictly in drought. Each region responds differently to drought and has different assets and challenges. All of the community is affected by drought, not just farmers. Businesses, shops and social events can close down as people hunker down and stop spending. Not every farmer is male – businesses are mostly partnerships – and not every farmer is on her last legs. Many farmers have taken advantage of rain when it does come, by making hay and stockpiling other fodder. Many are careful to protect their pastures and therefore their soil by selling or locking up livestock and feeding – a practice known as drought lotting – in dry times. Others over-graze and accelerate land degradation. This explains why driving through the countryside you can see one side of a fence is as bare as a board and the other with foot-high pasture. And yet, no matter how much you prepare, it is hard to manage for seven lean years with a business, bills to pay and an average farm debt. Land management is key. “It so much easier to be a good manager in a wet year,” Augathella farmer Rachelle Cameron says. “There is grass everywhere and no stress.” Summers ‘so scorchingly hot’ Four hours north of Wyandra, Louise and Andrew (Marto) Martin are sheep growers on the Mitchell Grass plains near Tambo, north-west of Brisbane. Looking out over the high grass, it doesn’t look too bad, certainly not the desert landscape pictures that metropolitan audiences are used to in drought. Macfarlane station is on an ancient inland sea – the Martin fossil collection contains ammonites and Huon pine, spat out of the black soil plains that expand and contract depending on the water content. Both Martins work the farm, while Andrew is also mayor of the Blackall-Tambo region. This year they got a bit of autumn rain and made bales of hay. They reduced their stocking rate to match the season, as much as is possible with lambing ewes. They’re not in favour of what Marto calls “agrarian socialism”, believing that subsidies create dependency. “The best way of dealing with drought is accepting you are going to have one,” Andrew says. He takes the longer view on climate, which he describes as always changing, while Louise echoes Schmidt experience that higher temperatures have been a feature of the latest drought. “It quite unusual to get over here but this last summer and the last couple of summers have been so scorchingly hot,” she says. “You can see the water being sucked out of the dams, sucked out of the soil, sucked out of my life and you can’t plan for that. “The way to plan for drought is you just have to make a decision and if you haven’t got enough grass, you sell [stock].” ‘Policy adverse to diversification’ Karen and Bill McLennan and their son Michael are in the Mulga Lands on the highway to Roma, just outside Charleville. Their diversification plan was an olive plantation – Sommariva Olives – made into oil, soap, tapenades and other products. They are trying to stay agile, in the government words, to drought-proof. Bill and Karen also work in the panel-beating business in Charleville through the week; they spread themselves thin in an effort to survive the climate and the conditions. Karen describes the good times, when the grass is above their knees, but looking out from their back deck off the olive shed, it is all mulga and red dirt. The olives get enough water to yield a crop every second year. She describes a life that is filled with work, in the panel shop, in the olive shed, in the mulga. The olives were to be the retirement plan, but their oil won awards and it has increased the cashflow in dry times. “You do get a bit sick of it, she says. “You often say, I want to get out. I have had enough, I just want to get out. But you can’t really sell when it this dry, you have to wait for the rain, and then hopefully, if you want to get out, you get out then when it looks nice. But probably everyone else thinks the same way so the market will be flooded.” They find government policies frustrating, the rhetoric encouraging farmers to diversify while erecting hurdles, or as Michael says, “government policy is actually adverse to diversification, it crazy”. Karen applied for some assistance to restructure their finances and was knocked back on account of their income from the panel-beating shop. “Like my husband says, when we are in drought, this whole area is in drought,” she says. “Our business in town struggles as well, because people can’t spend money in town. We get hit there as well as out here.” Pressure has increased on the family after the bank revalued their properties and stock as a result of the downturn in conditions, which changes the interest payments. Like all the farmers we speak to, they appreciate the city donations, though they have not received anything. Hay is tricky, given once you start feeding cattle, you have to keep going. One or two bales will not last long. One of the big movements in farming practice over recent years is towards grazing practices that respond to climate rather than keeping a set number of stock no matter what the climate. There are a number of farmers now who sell down stock and close down for dry periods but this requires a certain equity level. For the McLennans, it is not an option. It easy to say you need to destock going into a drought – but you can’t Michael McLennan “It easy to say you need to destock going into a drought, but you can’t,” Michael says. “The cost of getting into one of these places, you have to keep producing because if you don’t, how do you meet your loans? What is your income? In drought, costs go up, but cattle prices go down because no one else can buy for the next year.” North west of the McLennans, Doug and Rachelle Cameron live on the old station of Nive Downs, originally over square miles with its own post office and general store. It was split up in the and the couple have been on acres north of Augathella since Conditions were pretty good for the first few years, then it flooded before sliding into drought. They have cut their herd down from to and are preparing for the possibility they will not get their usual summer rain. In a normal year, the Cameron family gets inches of annual rainfall on Nive Downs, yet near the end of August they have only had six. Talk turns to what normal is. “The new norm seems to be drier and hotter over the years we have been here, with our average summer temperatures,” Rachelle says. “I wouldn’t say [climate change] is not happening. It seems to be all or nothing in the country.” The Camerons are trying to increase cash flow by diversifying into production of their Nive Beef jerky. Doug hit on it after a cattle price crash due to the temporary live export ban. At a roadhouse on the way back from the saleyards, he saw a packet of beef jerky for after he just sold cattle for a head. Doug was sick of being a price taker. “It didn’t matter what I did to the cattle – we could have the best genetics, the best everything – but outside influences just crushed us. I thought maybe we can make something out of the jerky and set the price.” Around Augathella, they grow their haystack in summer and cattle eat it down in winter. By autumn, they know whether they will have enough feed to get through the winter, and for the past five years it has never been enough, so they have sold off cattle. “This year is worse than every other year. We are missing all that growth, lately it been late rain, with a [short] eight-week window to grow before it cools out. You are not getting bulk feed through and that what hurt us in the community.” Farmers are not the only ones to suffer in drought. Dave* lost his job on a big cotton farm in a small northern NSW town when the drought started to bite. There was not enough water and the farmer cut back his cropping program. Like many farm workers, a cottage was part of his package. So when he lost his job, Dave and wife Margie* also lost their house. There was no redundancy package because the employer was not large enough. Dave was reeling from the job loss but Margie got active. The couple, in their late were carrying a bit of debt from the last drought when they were left unpaid for contracting work. So while looking for a new home, Margie also contacted their bank to apply for hardship provisions which the bank duly provided. But when a good friend gave them some money to tide them over, the bank dropped the hardship provision. Margie applied to Centrelink for Newstart, but given the couple have had various micro businesses, the application process was arduous to prove they had no hidden assets. She also contacted high profile drought charities who told her because they were not farmers, they could not help. Sixteen weeks after losing their job and home, they were still waiting for Newstart. The only assistance they have received is from the Country Womens Association, which pays up to for household expenses such as fuel, power, insurance and the like. Another city based charity arrived with groceries, lining up donated goods like a supermarket at a local hall. “The government needs to look after people who become unemployed with the drought,” Margie said. “There is no focus on contractors, the small businesses, it hard to get Centrelink assistance and those people end up leaving town.” The dry weather also places pressure on regular social events such as picnic races, campdrafts and other gatherings, which are important economically and socially. At a time when people need to keep an eye on others, the usual events can disappear from a town calendar, having a material effect on the state of mind of its inhabitants. ‘Women get depressed as much as the next man’ Christine McDougall is the director for mental health, alcohol and other drugs for the South West Hospital and Health Service under the Queensland government. Based in Roma, her patch is one of the largest health services in the state, covering square kilometres, but there are only people scattered across that vast “corner country”. McDougall has been a mental health nurse since but she says it makes her cry to drive around Charleville and Cunnamulla and see the effect on the community, first of the floods of which wrecked the soil and land, and now the latest drought. There are no mental health beds in the south west, and people are transported by the Royal Flying Doctors Service if necessary. The service aims to keep people in their own community, using local hospitals and providing full support as much as possible, via telehealth consultations and regular visits by clinicians. “We try to keep as many people as we can out here because it traumatic going into hospital in an aeroplane,” says McDougall. “We can’t make it rain but we can keep them going until it rains – we hope – and if they get the money from the government and all these donations coming, we can keep the social and emotional stuff going.” A straight-talking dairy farmer daughter from Gippsland in Victoria, she presses the point that women are farmers too. “People think of farmers and they have an image of a man; you ask women what they do and they say we are farmers. They know everything that is happening on the place. They are as likely to get as depressed, miserable or suicidal as the next man.” Three years ago the state government created positions for Regional Adversity Integrated Care Clinicians (Raiccs) to cope with drought and disaster. The approach was to get to as many people as possible, no matter how remote and no matter how few people turn up. The number of suicides has dropped in the region from to over the past two years. “I have not forgotten anyone I have looked after who has taken their life by suicide, you never forget them, and you always think what if I had done this or that – you don’t know,” she says. “We have to acknowledge too we never know the ones we stop.

23,"New official data shows clearing of forests near and along the Great Barrier Reef continued despite Australian government pledges to protect the natural wonder, with at least hectares felled in alone. Forests covering – an area about three times the size of the Australian Capital Territory – in the reef catchment zone have been bulldozed over the past five years. The area cleared last year was larger in size than that covered by new re-growth. Jessica Panegyres, a nature campaigner with the Wilderness Society, said it showed Australia should be considered a global deforestation hotspot on a par with the Amazon and Indonesia. Scott Morrison says Great Barrier Reef grant 'right financial decision' “The federal government has promised the world it is doing everything it can to protect the reef,” she said. “[It] has simply refused to act on deforestation, despite the major impacts on forests, wildlife, the reef and the climate.” The figures are included in the latest national greenhouse gas emissions accounts, which the government quietly released on Friday afternoon in the shadow of the AFL and NRL grand finals. They showed Australia emissions increased in the year to March continuing a trend at odds with the government repeated claim it is on track to meet the target it set at the Paris climate conference. Deforestation increases nutrient and sediment run-off on to the reef coast, hurting water quality, stimulating algae growth and at times smothering corals. The government has spent billions addressing poor water quality, considered second only to climate change as a threat to the reef. The land-clearing data for is described as a projection and does not include part of the Fitzroy river region. It was released as the government postponed a decision on whether to allow a farmer to clear nearly of forest at Kingvale station on Cape York. The federal environment minister, Melissa Price, is considering an environment department recommendation that the clearing, approved at state level in under the former premier Campbell Newman, be allowed despite the presence of endangered species. Scientific advice to the government suggests allowing the Kingvale clearing would likely increase sediment run-off on to the reef. A decision is now due by the end of October. Land-clearing spiked in Queensland after the former Liberal National government relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation. The Palaszczuk Labor government passed new land-clearing laws to restore earlier protections in May, prompting protests from farmers who said they needed to manage vegetation to produce the food and fibre expected by consumers. Back from the brink: the global effort to save coral from climate change Legacy clearing permits remain for about Panegyres said Price could block outstanding permits using national environmental laws that empower the minister to intervene if threatened species were at risk or an activity was likely to have a significant impact on the reef. Price said state and territory governments were primarily responsible for regulating land-clearing. She said the government Reef plan, submitted to Unesco, was focused on improving the reef resilience to climate change by reducing local pressures. “We know climate change is a big issue for the reef and this is why we have invested over to help protect the reef through the Great Barrier Reef Foundation,” she said. The minister said the emissions reduction fund, the central plank of Tony Abbott Direct Action climate policy, had incentivised a reduction in land-clearing. About of the taxpayer fund has been spent or committed. No new money has been allocated since More than from the fund had been used to pay for tree-planting and habitat restoration. Analysis of government data earlier this year found those emissions savings would effectively be wiped out by little more than two years of deforestation elsewhere in the country.",622,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/04/great-barrier-reef-forest-three-times-size-of-act-cleared-in-past-five-years
24,"If George Monbiot really wants to get people talking about the connection between climate change and the economy, he’d do better to find a different question to “how do we stop growth?” ( While growth continues we’ll never kick our fossil fuel habit , September). The elephant in the room is the assumption that nature resources and capabilities are so large that they can be considered infinite and so excluded from the economic cost of production. This has the unintended consequence of rewarding destruction. Hence the German situation in Hambacher: the lignite has value because it can be sold to be burned, the forest has none unless the trees are cut down for economic use. And, in an infinite world, there are always more forests. This form of thinking might have been a useful simplification when human population and activities were at the levels of the Enlightenment, when much of the philosophy that still drives the economy was developed. Indeed, for any one individual the world is still a remarkably big place and it is difficult to imagine it running out of anything. But a resource that would have supplied an Enlightenment-sized population for years would last today just years. And that is without considering increased rates of consumption. Maybe the better question is: how do we rewrite the rules of our economy to reward activities that nourish our future rather than those that destroy it? Harold Forbes Wareham, Dorset With reference to George Monbiot article and Sébastien Thibault brilliant illustration may I make two suggestions: first, that cycling in the UK is made much more user-friendly – at present only the most intrepid would dare to cycle on our roads, whereas in Holland cycling is an option for all ages, shapes and sizes, not just Lycra-clad athletes; second, when resources are scarce, it makes sense to introduce a fair system of rationing. I remember the rationing of food, clothing and fuel in the It was tiresome but necessary and it ensured that no one in UK starved. Rather than destroy our environment, we need to introduce a system of mileage rationing for people using modes of transport which run, directly or indirectly, on fossil fuels. I don’t believe it is a basic human right to be able to jet here, there and everywhere with no restrictions. Jill Greer Chadlington, Oxfordshire George Monbiot is right. It takes a peculiar form of obstinacy for news channels such as the BBC to consistently not mention climate change. Last week, for example, Jeremy Corbyn committed the Labour party to a huge investment in green technology coupled, to zero carbon emissions by This was ignored in favour of yet more pointless debates about Brexit. Future generations will look back on the present era with a profound sense of disbelief that the Kardashians command times more airtime than climate change does; and that the media obsession with Brexit resembles a pack of vultures fighting over a dead carcass from which every item of interest has long since been stripped bare. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Chair, Help Rescue the Planet George Monbiot is right (again). But is there any chance he could get together with, say, Owen Jones, Caroline Lucas and Justin Welby, to tell us how, practically, to get from where we are to where we should be, without catastrophic unemployment, poverty and civil unrest? Philip Hall Cotford St Luke, Somerset Re climate change, “be the change you wish to see in the world”. Stop driving fossil-fuel cars. Become vegetarian. Consume less. Use less energy. Do not follow fashion. Do not upgrade phones with every new model. Buy products, including clothes, furniture and household items to last. Recycle everything: plastic, glass, metal and organic matter. Take furniture, clothes, DVDs, CDs and everything else that is still usable to charity shops. Neil Sinclair Edinburgh George Monbiot considers the mismatch, between economic growth and environmental sustainability, on a global scale. At an individual level, we all need to forget what everyone else might be doing, and tailor our activities and consumption to much reduced totals. This has to mean a much simplified lifestyle: being happy with our personal relationships, reducing most forms of competition, and devoting our time to caring for other members of society. It means a fundamental change of attitude to everyone else. At a political level, we need to replace competitive politics with cooperative politics. Left and right politics is redundant, as are most of our politicians. As Larry Elliott once said in a related context, “ best of luck with that ”. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire George Monbiot is of course quite right. But why will he not take his argument to its logical conclusion? There is one overarching problem which is behind all the others: it subsumes global warming, pollution, the ozone hole, shortages of basic ingredients. It is the population problem: quite simply, there are too many of us. Someone, I forget who, has suggested that if everyone on earth had a European standard of living we would need about three planets to sustain us (five for a North American standard). Some people get very exercised over the thought that there might be or even billion of us by That is the wrong concern: they (and we) should worry about the billion we have now. I believe that it is not enough to slow or stop population growth; we need to reverse it – drastically, and fast – but this obviously raises some unpleasant decisions.

25,"Australia greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, fuelled by the expansion in gas exports and production, according to new figures published by the Department of Environment and Energy . The government quietly published its quarterly emissions figures on Friday afternoon, a public holiday in Victoria and the day of the release of the interim royal commission report into the banking sector. The figures show that Australia policy vacuum on climate continues to drive emissions upward and further away from the country Paris targets. The data show emissions climbed in the year to March The March quarter for which the data was published recorded a increase. Emissions were up across all sectors except electricity, which fell in the year to March, and land use, which the government is continuing to record as a carbon sink. Business council faces negative ad blitz over criticism of emissions target Fugitive emissions in the energy sector rose in the year to March. The Climate Analytics director, Bill Hare, said the numbers showed Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris commitment to reduce emissions by between and by from its levels. “While emissions from the national electricity market continue to decrease due to increasing renewable electricity, Australian emissions as a whole continue to increase,” he said. “On present trends, with virtually no policies apart from the renewable energy target, which will expire in and not be replaced, emissions are set to gallop way past the Paris agreement target.” He said the figures also showed the decline in per capita emissions was beginning to flatten out “at a time when this should be accelerating”. Matt Drum, the managing director of NDEVR environmental, which tracks emissions and publishes its own quarterly reports months ahead of the government, said the absence of climate policy meant emissions were going up. “All the figures show emissions are increasing because they’ve got no policy,” he said. “What I’m really interested in is what policy is Labor going to reveal in the coming weeks? “The current government have made it very clear they’re not interested in doing anything about emissions.” The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said it was “embarrassing” that climate pollution was continuing to rise in a wealthy country like Australia. Di Natale says Greens will take hard line with a Shorten government on emissions “This latest pollution scorecard casts extreme doubt over the Morrison government claim that Australia will meet our emissions reduction targets ‘in a canter’ without strong new action. “This latest result is also flattered by falling emissions from power generation, driven by the construction of solar and wind energy under our national renewable energy target. “The Morrison government has declared it will not replace this target after meaning Australian climate pollution is at risk of growing even further.” The environment minister, Melissa Price, did not respond to questions about the increase in emissions. She said in a statement that emissions were currently below levels. The statement said the latest report on Australia national greenhouse gas inventory clearly showed the country was on track to beat its emissions target.",518,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/australias-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climb-again-amid-climate-policy-vacuum
26,"The UN environment chief, under fire over huge travel expenses and rule-breaking, has been forced leave the UN general assembly in New York early and return to his Nairobi headquarters to deal with the growing crisis. The problems for Erik Solheim, Norwegian head of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), include the Netherlands becoming the latest nation to withhold millions of dollars in funding until the issues are resolved. The Guardian can also reveal that Solheim has now recused himself from professional dealings with his wife and a Norwegian company that employed her shortly after it signed a deal with Unep in April. Pressure is growing on Solheim after he was sharply criticised by a draft internal UN audit over his globe-trotting travels that called them “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction”. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and that he claimed unjustified expenses. The UN staff union in Nairobi, where Unep is headquartered, called some of the draft audit findings “mind-blowing”. Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and that he had made changes where other rules had been broken. Solheim wrote to all national ambassadors on the committee that oversees Unep work on Tuesday to tell them he was cutting short his New York trip and putting in place measures to increase the accountability of managers and their travel. “We will address issues of trust between management, our staff, member states and/or partners,” he said in a letter seen by the Guardian. Unep is governed by the UN environment assembly , the world highest-level decision-making body on the environment. Its president, Siim Kiisler, Estonia environment minister, told the Guardian the next steps to be taken would be decided when the internal audit was completed. “I need to ensure that member states have full trust that their resources are used for the benefit of the environment,” Kiisler said. “I will read the official report carefully, talk to Mr Solheim and after that form a standpoint.” He said Solheim travels had played an important role in making Unep visible, but added: “It certainly has too look and feel right as well, and of course, follow the rules of the system.” On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Dutch government told the Guardian: “A planned payment of will be held until Unep provides more clarity, and until it is clear that Unep is taking this matter seriously.” The job taken by Solheim wife, Gry Ulverud, is with the Norwegian company X Ocean , which aims to build the world biggest research ship as well as a “World Ocean Headquarter” near Oslo. On May, the company announced a memorandum of understanding with Unep , although Unep did not issue a press release. On June, Ulverud posted on her Facebook page: “Started New Job at at X – Manager for Strategy and Partnership”. The page has now been removed . “In relation to any notion of nepotism, I wish to clarify that my spouse was recruited to REV Ocean through an open, transparent and competitive process,” said Solheim. He said her recruitment was based on years of professional experience “with the Norwegian Refugee Council, as a diplomat, as deputy representative to Unesco from and over years with the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.” Solheim said he wrote to the UN Ethics Office for advice on the matter of his wife appointment on July and again on September, when he told it REV Ocean was giving Unep funding over four years. Solheim said he received the advice on September and wrote to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to recuse himself on September, the same day the Guardian first contacted him on the matter. Solheim said he and Ulverud would have no “direct bilateral interaction” when acting in their official capacities. He said all matters relating to REV Ocean would now be dealt with by the Unep deputy executive director. Nations halt funding to UN environment programme as outcry over chief grows The Guardian has also seen emails relating to an initial refusal to allow Ulverud to attend a Unep meeting on marine plastic litter in May, just before she started at REV Ocean. One senior manager advises Ulverud to ask an official for “assistance”. That official then asks colleagues: “Can we think of a creative way to have Gry join the meeting next week?” Ulverud was subsequently invited. “The available records do not indicate that Ms Ulverud used any influence to obtain access to the meeting other than being an employee of a private sector entity in partnership with Unep,” said Solheim. Her contract started just after the meeting took place, but a Unep spokesman said: “Her employer requested her to do a number of things before assuming her new functions, including attending the meeting in Nairobi.” The Guardian can be contacted securely here or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com",822,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/under-fire-un-environment-chief-forced-back-to-hq-erik-solheim
27,"n the brightest of days, the road into autumn is a frenetic gyratory for wasps, bees and hoverflies around outcrops of ivy. The yellows and browns of their bodies are the colours of changing leaves, the blur of their wings is mist over rivers, the sound of their flight is of the last crazy dance of the year fuelled by an intoxicant that makes them invulnerable. Whether the insects sense that this is the last of the fine weather, as the forecasters predict, they are joining the dots between ivy flowers that open in the final fling of warm sunshine. Arranged in five or more umbels on each stem, there are or so flowers in each. The individual flower is a green knob enclosed by five sepals that roll back to cup an inner orb. Between the sepals, five yellow stamens spring out above the central stigma, and the orb is sticky with nectar. I put a flowering umbel in my mouth and it has a strange, sweet, musty taste. Many insects must have visited those flowers, and I can only imagine how powerful their sweetness is to insects that have high-energy, airborne lives. The wasps are big drinkers. Although their mandibles look like jaws, they are for hunting and shaving wood; their mouthparts are a tubular proboscis for sipping liquids. They and other colony-living insects have sent scouts to find and guide their community to the flowers using point-source navigation. Others have followed scent trails here to dance at the last flower festival, including the ivy bees that look like ginger-jacketed honeybees and have only been in Shropshire since English ivy: berry good for birds As I walk the ivied lanes and watch the party, I think about the passing a couple of days ago of my old friend Geoff Dean – artist, socialist and teacher – who would have loved this sunny autumn day full of life and community. Just then I feel a searing pain. Stung by a jasper (wasp), I join the festivities with my own most ridiculous dance: flinging hat, rubbing head, hopping about in case the bloody jasper down my shirt. Someone, I know, is finding this hilarious.

28,"arely had we let the sediment of evening settle before a badger entered stage right. It trundled to the light and its brindle-haired body was so dome-shaped that it gave the impression not so much of Britain largest terrestrial predator (after ourselves) as of a boulder moving. Like stone it also seemed rooted, certain of its place and of its unfolding routine – the indifference it showed to the adjacent hide, the assumption that there would be food, and the workaday manner it dismantled the peanut cache. This had been hidden for it in a pine stump and round its root base, but also in pockets cut into a horizontal log capped by heavy rocks. The badger made light of it all. Raised on hind legs, it churned a blunt snout through the pine trough. Throughout the visit we could hear an unending slurp-chomp of groundnuts or the badger snuffled breath that was one part respiration, one part relentless sampling of the woodland air. There was one extraordinary moment when it looked troubled, the five-banded head froze and faced straight at us, and the shiny jet flake at its snout-end fell silent. There was a mica-speck of light glinting in those almond eyes as the badger whittled away at the night chemistry for danger. But there was no recognition, and on it snuffled. Huge increase in badger cull will see up to shot To find a final meal concealed in the log, it snouted out nuts below a capstone. This quartz, more than a billion years old, is the bedrock in these parts and from a time when Scotland stood about where Antarctica rests today. It was no match for the flint-axe head of a badger, which nuzzled it aside like a cub. A moment later and the glorious creature rocked away across the ground until it merged with darkness. It was odd to reflect that this local, whose residence is as old as the hills, should be the one that the government blames and, against all reason, has chosen to kill , for a disease in an animal that we brought with us when we arrived as strangers.",359,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/02/country-diary-a-close-encounter-with-a-badger
29,"he fierce westerly wind drove in unwilling travellers; birds whose winter home is the restless sea were forced ashore. Battered corpses lay along the tide mark, but their manner of death was not certain; starvation, exhaustion, disease, or even human agency may have been responsible. But there was no doubt about the living derelicts. One of these was a young gannet, a huge, unwieldy bird, in its first mottled plumage. Balancing uneasily on the sea-wall, it launched forth on our approach, but the wind and its weight brought it to the sand, where it strove repeatedly to get on the wing. Keeping track of the gannets of the Bass Rock The second pelagic wanderer in trouble was a forked-tailed petrel which we met drifting southward along the beach. It paddled along the wet sand with wings outspread, striving to rise, and I paddled after it, but even on this unusual surface it beat me in the race. Sooner or later the poor bird would drift inland and perish among the dunes. At sea, well off shore, it could rest on the waves; in the sands it was helpless.",188,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/01/country-diary-wind-battered-birds-1918
30,"walk over the exposed hillside above Giggleswick Scar and push past the elder crowding the entrance to Kinsey cave. The dripping limestone grotto, like many of Craven karst caves, has been a time capsule, trapping evidence of the human and natural past in sediment and protecting it from the passage of glaciers. It is an unassuming space, but one that reverberates with significance in the debate around rewilding . Two of Britain lost charismatic carnivores – the lynx and the brown bear – made their last known appearance here. I am not sure what I expect to find. It not as though there are archaeological gems scattered over the floor; Kinsey has been excavated from the Victorian era onwards, and the findings have either been lost or stashed in archives. But among the latter are the bones of both brown bear and lynx, native animals we extirpated from these shores. It was once thought their British extinctions occurred in the bronze age, but research into the discoveries made in Kinsey cave has rewritten the histories of both species. Since the turn of the millennium, bones of the creatures in the Kinsey archives have been carbon dated in separate studies, and both found to have been from animals alive in the early medieval period. In the lynx case, this was about years closer to the present than previously dated remains, a find that has given weight to current calls for reintroduction. The bear bone is the latest wild specimen found in Britain by a margin of around years (although, as a recent University of Nottingham paper has pointed out, it could also be from a descendant of bears imported by the Romans rather than a “native” animal). No serious calls are being made for the brown bear reintroduction, but on the Kinsey evidence, its presence here could be at least as recent as the lynx. There is a womblike calm inside the cave. I listen for some distant resonance from a time before the Yorkshire landscape was fully tamed, but instead simply feel the quiet poignancy of standing where two beautiful animals last appeared.",353,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/01/country-diary-cave-secrets-of-lost-charismatic-carnivores
31,"he single track road, its potholes patched and repatched like a threadbare jacket, plummets down to the burn and up again in a steep V. Along its unfenced verges, the wind tugs at thistledown and at sparse clumps of gorse, the occasional hawthorn. Goldfinches flurry along. Impervious sheep graze the sloping fields. This is where the Kingswood Burn runs through a cleugh, the Northumberland word for a ravine. Trees cluster the sides, delineating the watercourse, a thick-grown quiet place for owls and deer. There a mixture of holly and birch, hawthorn and sycamore, and, in the wettest places, alder. I look down on to this snaking wood and, over it, to the zigzag of the narrow road as it crosses ridge after ridge and think about the uphill walk once I have descended to the stream. Down in the valley bottom there a little stone bridge. A group of red-legged partridges scurry up a sandy bank, their plumage a series of rusty bars over delicate grey. In the rough grass, shaggy ink caps cluster, some turning sludgy black as their spores develop. As I start the climb, there a rhythmical line of beech trees to my left. They curve like a breaking wave, branches sweeping up from the west to bend down to the east, moulded by gales and weather. Growing closely, maybe they’re an outgrown hedge or planted densely to provide some shelter. Their roots wrap over boulders, trunks knuckle and bulge, branches weld together or gesture out at odd angles. It hard not to relate them to human forms with their hints of limbs and faces. These trees inspired the Allendale printmaker Cat Moore . It was seeing her linocut at the Gallery in the Hills , a converted barn at the top of this hill, that prompted me to revisit these special beeches. Now, looking back down on the cleugh, I see what I missed before. This road could only have been made after the invention of the motor vehicle. A much older track, a sunken green line, hugs the hillside at an angle more suitable for horse and cart.

32,"he damage caused when hundreds of twitchers trample a fragile nature reserve to bag a photograph of a rare bird is relatively well-known. Butterfly watchers are considered a more genteel breed. Wading through a wildflower meadow in pursuit of butterflies is a supreme summertime pleasure. When one person does it, the flowers spring back within hours. Unfortunately, numerous people, no matter how well-intentioned, congregating in one spot can cause problems.

Whitecross Green Wood is a hotspot, its beautiful rides are linear wildflower meadows. But one volunteer warden reports that black hairstreak seekers this year ignored notices, left mown walkways and trampled flat half of one ride. You often see trampled patches where admirers stand beside brambles, taking photos. According to the warden, repeated annual trampling is gradually degrading the ride flora and compacting the soil, imperilling ground- and soil-dwelling invertebrates. What can we do?

33,"rant Hazlehurst, a civil servant from Bromley, Kent has seen many whales. “Fin, sperm, Cuvier beaked, True beaked, sei, long-fin pilot …” most of them from his regular jaunts on a car ferry in the Bay of Biscay. “But I never thought I would see a beluga, not in the Thames,” he said. “So, I’m hoping.” So were the two dozen or so others who, on Friday morning, gathered on a windy shore near Gravesend, scanning foam-flecked waves in anticipation that, for a fourth day, the beluga whale that has somehow got lost in the Thames , would show itself. Two hours in and Bill, who had travelled from Somerset, had only managed to tick off a sparrowhawk. He had heard about the beluga on a birding app. “But I didn’t believe it. I was waiting for it to come up: ‘Correction. Albino porpoise,’” he said. Now he was here, and – ping – his alert went off: “Whale spotted, just west of the Ship and Lobster pub.” It was a couple of kilometres away. He was off at a trot. “I’m a happy man,” he said later, after managing to see it. Peter Cartwright, was one of the first to spot it on Friday. “First you see this big melon head coming up, and then it rolls over. It just like a big white tyre,” said the counsellor from south-east London. He and his brother had, cunningly, split up and gone in different directions to maximise their chances. Was it exciting? “Absolutely. It a beluga,” he said. Beluga whales, which can grow up to six metres in length, are normally at home in icy Arctic waters around Svalbard, Greenland, or in the Barents Sea, so the warmer temperature of the Thames is problematic. The lonely Thames beluga whale is an anomaly – and an omen | Philip Hoare Rescue teams have been on standby since the whale was first seen on Tuesday. But the plan seems to be to monitor and wait as long as the animal appears healthy and is not showing distress. How long a wait is not an easy question, even for the experts. Though two belugas were briefly spotted off the Northumberland coast in this week sighting is the furthest ever south. It appears to have a food source, but its thick blubber is designed for the Arctic. “We’ve never had the opportunity, thankfully, to observe such a situation before, so we really don’t know how long it could remain,” said Lucy Babey, head of science and conservation at the charity Orca. First to spot the cetacean, known to ancient mariners as the “sea canary” for its distinctive clicks, squawks and whistles, was ecologist Dave Andrews, working on a bird survey in the area on Tuesday. A white shape caught his eye but he wasn’t sure if it was just a wave. “About one hour later, I heard the whoosh sound of a blow of a whale,” he said, “and it was just out in front of me. I was quite shocked. I had seen them before in the Arctic so I knew. But I couldn’t quite believe I was seeing it there in the Thames.” Andrews shot video and posted to the Rare Bird Alert and to Twitter. Then, he said, “the craziness started”. Within two hours TV helicopter crews were flying overhead, and around people had descended on Gravesend, with others also on the opposite bank at Tilbury. Wildlife writer and photographer James Lowen immediately sped from his Norfolk home. “It was a once-in-a-life time sighting,” said Lowen, who has visited the Arctic but never before seen a beluga. “Failed on the Svalbard, yet succeeded on the Thames. Incredible.” “Seen with the naked eye it was was like a moon rolling through the water, but with binoculars, you could see this great melon-shaped forehead. Some people were lucky enough to see it ‘spy hopping’ which is when it pops its head above the water to look around.” Wildlife cameraman Richard Taylor-Jones, who saw the Twitter alert, was “quite incredulous”. “But there was no doubt about it. The pictures said it. It was a beluga whale. So I jumped in the car because I thought this is an opportunity I simply cannot miss.” He added: “Lots have come down from London. You hear people saying: ‘Crikey, I was supposed to be in the office today.’ “There are some very keen people and lots of smiles. It a very jovial atmosphere, because it something extraordinary.” Orca 'apocalypse': half of killer whales doomed to die from pollution On seeing the whale, he felt “excitement, and shock, and incredulity”. “But then, very quickly followed by a degree of sadness, because I just can’t see this story ending well. I hope, of course, that it going to make its way back out to sea. But it just shouldn’t be here,” he said. The whale has been spotted taking deep breaths and diving, as though feeding, and swimming vigorously against the tide. Volunteers from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue have inspected it at close quarters from a boat, and believe it appears healthy. The Port of London Authority is protecting the whale by warning boats to avoid the area, and urging the public to admire it from the shore and not approach in boats, or fly drones or TV helicopters over it. One fear is it may swim further up the Thames towards London. Martin Garside, a spokesman from the Port of London Authority, said it had remained in roughly the same spot since Tuesday. While it was a marvellous spectacle, he maintained: “The best thing for this whale is that it is never seen again.” The hopes are it will find its own way back out to sea. Something has gone wrong with its sophisticated sonar navigation system, either through illness or through its system being confused by environmental factors, including, possibly, shipping traffic or the construction of platforms, experts believe. Said Babey: “It a little bit sad to see it, mixed still with that excitement that there is a beluga in our waters. But the overriding concern is it is thousands of miles away from its normal home. So, it does raise the questions why it here, and will it be OK.” While it remains here, however, the whale continues to draw spectators. Brian Philpot, and his wife, Maureen, set up camp on Friday at sheltered from the wind by a bush, having travelled from Dunstable, Bedfordshire. “We are really hoping to see it,” said Brian, an electrician and self-confessed “twitcher”. But, he conceded, it probably would not compete with the black-browed albatross he once spotted off Scotland.",1112,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/beluga-fever-is-tinged-with-sorrow-for-whale-watchers-on-thames
34,"Environmentally friendly gardeners who attempt to deter slugs and snails from devouring their vegetables with eggshells or copper tape are wasting their time, according to a study by the Royal Horticultural Society . Gastropods inflicted the same damage to lettuces protected with five natural methods – eggshells, copper tape, horticultural grit, pine bark mulch and wool pellets – as they did to lettuces left untreated. These methods were tested on lettuces sown in pots and raised beds at the RHS field research facility in Wisley . After six weeks, the leaves of each harvested lettuce were examined to calculate damage. Lettuces planted in the ground were found to be more susceptible to slugs, with of each eaten on average. This compares to just of those in pots, which, despite this advantage, yielded less crop. The natural methods were thought ineffective because slugs and snails’ thick mucus enables them to glide over these apparently sharp barriers. But wool pellets and pine bark did have one clear benefit: by acting as a fertiliser and mulch, they helped lettuces yield a bigger crop. According to the RHS, some slug species have clear benefits for gardeners, such as the leopard slug, which eats fungi and rotting material, helping recycle garden nutrients. But Dr Hayley Jones, entomologist at the RHS and lead researcher, said: “With the likes of eggshells, barks and mulch so far proving no discernible deterrent to slugs and snails, we would recommend using proven formulas like nematode biological control if the damage is just too much to bear.” Nematodes are microscopic parasitic worms that feed upon molluscs but also risk killing non-pest garden species such as water snails. Say goodbye to slugs, snails, mice and badgers Jones added: “Slug pellets do have their problems but they have been tested for safety and when used to their manufacturers’ instructions the risks are quite minimal. It becomes dangerous for pets and other wildlife when they are overapplied.” Previous research revealed that gardeners who handpick slugs and snails from their vegetables must dispatch them more than metres away , because otherwise a homing instinct can help them return. Jones said of this method: “It is time-consuming but it is definitely the most environmentally friendly way to go about it.” One famous method not yet tested is beer traps. Jones said she would like to test this method because there is a risk such traps only lure more slugs on to gardeners’ vegetable patches.",408,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/eggshell-and-copper-tape-do-not-protect-veg-from-slugs-and-snails
35,"A Seattle-area fish processor who hoped to cash in on China appetite for sea cucumber faces years in prison for his role in a poaching scheme that rocked an already unstable fishery. Federal prosecutors claim Hoon Namkoong led a years-long operation to poach and sell sea cucumbers as regulators were cutting the struggling Washington state fishery. Dozens of divers are also implicated in the poaching ring. Namkoong bought at least of stolen sea cucumber taken illegally from waters once rich with the echinoderms. A leading US sea cucumber wholesaler, Namkoong made millions selling to buyers domestically and in China, where demand has spiked for sea cucumber. Namkoong, faces up to two years in prison when he is sentenced on Friday. Sea cucumber is a luxury food and traditional medicine in China. Demand for them has risen as Chinese incomes have grown, and the inflation-adjusted price paid to fishermen has more than doubled since the early Sea cucumber stocks are under threat globally as fishermen dive to meet demand. “My old boss says they make a really good clam dip,” joked Hank Carson, a Washington department of fish and wildlife research scientist who studies and manages the state sea cucumber fishery. Cousins to the starfish and sea urchin, sea cucumbers are prized for the five bands of muscle cocooning their gooey centers. They are collected by divers linked to the surface by hose, then split and drained at sea. Processors like Namkoong buy the gutted cucumber, which is then dehydrated for sale. For being such simple creatures … they’re really bizarre Sea cucumber stocks in Washington fell dramatically during what Carson described as the fishery “gold rush” in the late and In a pattern repeated in fisheries worldwide, Washington sea cucumber harvest – once America largest – ballooned to an unsustainable level before fears of a collapse prompted regulation to protect the poorly understood creature. “They’re really mysterious animals,” Carson said. “For being such simple creatures … they’re really bizarre.” Sea cucumber change their size and weight on demand, spewing or inhaling water. Their migration patterns are unknown and the age of an individual cucumber is impossible to discern. They sometimes eviscerate themselves, expelling their internal organs, though researchers aren’t sure why they do so. Carson, who was Washington leading sea cucumber regulator while the poaching was occurring, said he is optimistic the fishery can rebound. Tribal fishermen, whose treaty rights afford them half the sea cucumber catch, and their non-tribal counterparts had been sacrificing to preserve the fishery. The poachers threatened that work. Sea cucumber fishermen must report their catch to regulators, who decide when the annual quota has been harvested. Namkoong and more than fishermen cheated the system by dramatically underreporting the catch, which Namkoong paid for in part with cash. Poached sea cucumbers were salted and dried at Orient Seafood Production, Namkoong suburban Seattle processing plant. Chinese appetite for totoaba fish bladder kills off rare porpoise “That was a big setback,” said Carson, describing the poaching ring impact on the fishery management. “Lawful harvesters were making cuts, and unlawful harvesters were taking more.” Namkoong pleaded guilty in April to conspiring to violate a federal law prohibiting poaching and wildlife trafficking. Prosecutors have asked that he be ordered to pay in restitution and serve a two-year prison term. “Namkoong caused this stressed resource to be over-harvested by over pounds,” the assistant US attorney Matthew Diggs said in court papers. “He did so for the sole reason of enriching himself.” In letters filed with the court, Namkoong friends described him as a generous, hardworking business owner well-regarded within his industry. Defense attorney Wayne Fricke argued that Namkoong was motivated in part by a desire to “help those divers who were attempting to make a living”. While Namkoong hopes to be spared prison when he is sentenced on Friday, prosecutors have asked that he receive a two-year term. He is expected to be sentenced by the US district judge Ricardo Martinez in Seattle.",662,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/sea-cucumber-poacher-washington

The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science released the September quarter figures for Australia resource and energy exports on Tuesday. The figures largely confirm the projections for global commodity prices and volumes contained in the June quarter projections , with slight revisions. When the June quarter projections were released, they showed the export value of Australia coal briefly rising above the export value of iron ore in before falling below iron again in A story in the Australian zeroed in on that brief phenomenon and characterised it as coal regaining its spot “as the nation biggest export earner”. Adani coalmine: full environmental statement not required to expand dam The story then quoted Canavan as saying: “At current prices we’d be mad not to open up the Galilee basin as soon as possible. “Opening up the Galilee would generate direct mining jobs and tens of billions in taxes. The market conditions are right for this to happen so Labor should stop pandering to the Greens and get these jobs going.” The shadow energy minister, Mark Butler, said the figures from the June report were being misrepresented. “Minister Canavan and [the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull] may think it their job to present this as a booming market but the Australian people, especially those living and working in thermal coal communities, deserve to be treated with respect and intelligence,” Butler said. In the September quarter figures, the value of Australia liquefied natural gas exports is forecast to increase from in to bn in driven by higher volumes and higher prices. In fact, LNG is forecast to overtake metallurgical coal as Australia second highest resource export by value in LNG contract prices – at which most Australian LNG is sold – are projected to increase, in line with oil prices.

37,"Backers of mini nuclear power stations have asked for billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to build their first UK projects, according to an official document. Advocates for small modular reactors (SMRs) argue they are more affordable and less risky than conventional large-scale nuclear plants, and therefore able to compete with the falling costs of windfarms and solar power. But the nuclear industry claims that the mini plants would be a cheap option for producing low-carbon power appear to be undermined by the significant sums it has been asking of ministers. Some firms have been calling for as much as to fund construction costs, according to a government-commissioned report, released under freedom of information rules. Companies also wanted up to of public money to help steer their reactor designs through the regulatory approval process, which is a cost usually paid by nuclear companies. Ten companies hoping to build the plants requested direct government funding, according to the briefing paper by the Expert Finance Working Group on Small Reactors . While the report named the companies involved in the mini nuclear projects, it did not specify who was asking for financial support. David Lowry , a nuclear policy consultant who obtained the document, said: “SMRs are either old, discredited designs repackaged when companies see governments prepared to throw taxpayers’ subsidies to support them, or are exotic new technologies, with decades of research needed before they reach commercial maturity.” The working group that drafted the report, and was appointed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), urged the government in August to put in place a framework to help bring the smaller plants to market. The government has already offered of funding for research and development of one group of SMRs, which typically have a capacity of less than a tenth of the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant being built in Somerset, or enough power for homes. Mini nuclear power stations are unlikely to supply clean energy to Britain homes and businesses any time soon. Of more than British, US and Chinese companies that have expressed an interest in building one in the UK, the majority told the working group that their power stations would be ready to deployed in the The companies include UK firms such as Rolls-Royce, Sheffield Forgemasters and Atkins, along with China CNNC, US companies NuScale and Westinghouse, and France EDF Energy . The working group found the firms’ cost estimates “varied significantly”, to the degree that some of the companies clearly had a “lack of understanding” of how British nuclear regulation works. It also noted that some of the companies proposed using “non-standard fuels” rather than the conventional uranium used by today nuclear plants, which “may add cost to business models” because of new facilities to produce and later manage the spent fuel. The firms told the group that the four main barriers they faced were finding and confirming sites, the cost of regulatory approval for their designs, a lack of state funding and unclear policy. The government is expected to make announcements soon regarding the siting regime and regulatory approvals for SMRs, sources told the Guardian. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the reactors could “provide flexible, reliable nuclear power to complement other low-carbon sources of generating electricity … [and] a potential export opportunity”. A spokesperson for the UK SMR consortium, which includes Rolls- Royce, said: “One of the compelling elements of our consortium power station is that, after the design is fully developed and licensed, no government funding is required to construct or operate it.”",598,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/30/energy-firms-demand-billions-from-uk-taxpayer-for-mini-reactors
38,"The National Trust and other conservation groups have urged ministers to rule out burying nuclear waste below national parks as fears grow that the Lake District is being eyed as a potential site. In January, the government restarted its attempt to find a community willing to host such a facility after a previous search collapsed five years ago. Ministers have refused to exclude national parks from the process. The green groups argued putting a nuclear dump under a national park would threaten the spent by millions of visitors. “We recognise that safe disposal of nuclear waste is one of the key challenges our society currently faces but this should not be used as an excuse to put at risk the huge range of benefits these areas deliver for society, the environment and the economy,” the groups said in an open letter to the nuclear energy minister, Richard Harrington. The Lake District national park is seen as a potential location for the underground facility, given Cumbria nuclear history and proximity to Sellafield, where most of the UK nuclear waste is currently stored. The groups, which include the Woodland Trust and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said Harrington risked undermining “long-established protections” afforded to national parks by comparing the prospect of a deep nuclear waste facility to a potash mine in North Yorkshire. Harrington cited the mine as an example of development within national parks, telling MPs this summer that the potash mine would “leave very little blot on the landscape”. Asked if he would exclude national parks as possible locations for a geological disposal facility for nuclear waste, Harrington said: “I am not saying we should have them on national parks but it would be very wrong to exclude them at the moment in this big policy statement.” Ministers have subsequently argued that “we cannot afford to restrict the siting process” and “most of the facility will be underground”, in letters to campaigners that have been seen by the Guardian. MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee concluded that national parks should not be excluded . Roy Payne, the executive director of GDF Watch, which is monitoring the siting process, said even if parks were not ruled out, the chance of the facility being built beneath one was “close to zero”, given local communities had the final say. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: “Legislation already ensures developments in national parks can only proceed in exceptional circumstances and must be appropriate and proportionate.”",420,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/nuclear-waste-national-parks-lake-district-conservation-groups
39,"Three environmental activists jailed for their part in an anti-fracking protest have released a video message promising they will win the battle against fracking. The men became the first to receive a custodial sentence for environmental protests against shale gas extraction this week. Simon Roscoe Blevins, and Richard Roberts, were given months in prison and Richard Loizou, was sentenced to months in jail on Wednesday after being convicted of causing a public nuisance by a jury at Preston crown court in August. In a message that has been released as the men wait in Preston prison to be moved to jails elsewhere in the country, Loizou said he would miss everything about his life outside while serving his sentence. But he added: “I think we will win, because this is a last-ditch attempt to squeeze the remaining fossil fuels from the earth. It is like industry clinging on to an old paradigm of the way things operate.” In the message, Roberts recounted his part in a four-day protest that blocked a convoy of trucks carrying drilling equipment from entering the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool. He said he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt when he climbed on to a truck, where he remained for four days. “I got on this lorry about o’clock in the morning … I was just in shorts and T-shirt. The only reason I was able to stay up there for three days and nights was because local people handed up clothing, sleeping bags, food…” The jailing of fracking protesters tells us we are winning this fight | Caroline Lucas The court heard this week that the jailing of the men meant they were the first to receive custodial sentences for environmental protest in the UK since the mass trespass on Kinder Scout in the Peak District in which marked the beginning of the right-to-roam movement.

Sentencing the men, the judge, Robert Altham, said he thought the three men posed a risk of reoffending and could not be rehabilitated as “each of them remains motivated by an unswerving confidence that they are right”. He added: “Even at their trial they felt justified by their actions. Given the disruption caused in this case, only immediate custody can achieve sufficient punishment.” He said that while the defendants were motivated by a serious concern for the environment, they saw the public as “necessary and justified collateral damage”. Members of the men families sitting in the public gallery burst into tears when the verdicts were read out. They sang a song described as a “native tribal song of power” and blew kisses to them as they were led out of the dock. Speaking for the prosecution, Craig MacGregor said the police argued that the demonstration resulted in significant travel disruption, causing the road to be closed initially until a contraflow was established. Police said local residents had had their lives disrupted and local businesses suffered a loss of trade. MacGregor said lorry drivers were told to stay with their cabs and were unable to return home.

41,"Children in the UK are being denied their basic human right to breathe clean air and facing a long term “health crisis” because of the toxic fumes they breathe on their way to and from school, according to leading children charity Unicef. The organisation, which campaigns on children rights and wellbeing around the world, described the situation in the UK as “horrific” and has announced it is to make protecting youngsters from air pollution its priority across the country in the months ahead. London air pollution is poisoning my son, says campaigner “I have been amazed as the picture has emerged showing us just exactly what the impact of air pollution is on children in the UK,” said Alastair Harper from Unicef UK. “Research is coming out all the time showing us how these toxic emissions can lead to lasting and devastating health impacts, impacts that will last their entire lives, from stunted lung growth to asthma to brain developments . It is horrific.” Unicef intervention follows a series of new studies which highlight the impact of the UK air pollution crisis on children health and will increase the pressure on government to intervene. The charity, which is now working with schools across the country, as well as clean air groups, is calling on the government to introduce a fully funded national action plan to protect children from the effects of toxic air. Harper said: “We want a national strategy specifically to protect children from harm, and a ring-fenced pot of funding to focus on the ways to reduce children exposure to toxic air. “We now know that exposure is most acute when they are travelling to and from school or nurseries and even inside the classrooms. Now there is no excuse not to take immediate and determined action.” He said measures should include vehicle exclusion zones around schools, a network of clean air zones, improved walking and cycling infrastructure in towns and cities and more child friendly urban areas. Last year a Guardian investigation revealed hundreds of thousands of children are being exposed to illegal levels of damaging air pollution from diesel vehicles at more than schools and nurseries across England and Wales. Earlier this month it emerged that children were absorbing a disproportionate amount of air dangerous pollution on their way to and from school – and while in the classroom. One school was found to have several times over the World Health Organization pollution limit for the most damaging particulates inside several of its classrooms. There is a growing campaign among some parents and schools to ban the school run and encourage walking and cycling, but Unicef said central government needs to step in to orchestrate a nationwide policy that protects young people health. “It has taken a while to understand the true nature of the problem but now we do know and we have to act.” Harper said that unlike some other problems facing young people – including entrenched poverty and obesity – air pollution was relatively simple to address, if there was the political will. “The fact is that it is so needless, we can fix this – other things are more intractable – but this is something we can resolve.” The government has been widely criticised for its lack of action on air pollution. It has lost three court cases and is one of five nations that have been referred to Europe highest court for failing to tackle illegal levels of toxic air. Harper said: “All children have the right to breathe clean air, and toxic air not only violates children right to breathe clean air it also impacts on their future and that is unacceptable.”",612,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/uks-children-denied-basic-human-right-to-clean-air-says-unicef
42,"ondon air pollution history – the Victorian pea-souper fogs, the deaths of people in the smog and the Clean Air Acts that followed – are well known. Dublin, just miles away, has a different history. Here it was smog in the that prompted a ban on the sale of bituminous, or “smoky” coal in Smoke pollution dropped by and there were fewer deaths from breathing problems. The ban was rolled out to other Irish towns and many of these also recorded a reduction in winter deaths. Pollutionwatch: wood burning is not climate friendly A new study has revealed that an old menace has returned to Dublin. Although the coal ban worked in the it did not address smokeless coals and solid fuels. Wood and peat are marketed as slow-renewable , green or carbon-neutral biofuels , but their air pollution impacts can be significant . During three weeks in November and December Dublin breached World Health Organization guidelines for particle pollution on eight days. Chemical analysis of the pollution at these times showed the dominance of peat and wood smoke in the evenings.

43,"At least half of the world killer whale populations are doomed to extinction due to toxic and persistent pollution of the oceans, according to a major new study. Although the poisonous chemicals, PCBs, have been banned for decades, they are still leaking into the seas. They become concentrated up the food chain; as a result, killer whales, the top predators, are the most contaminated animals on the planet. Worse, their fat-rich milk passes on very high doses to their newborn calves. PCB concentrations found in killer whales can be times safe levels and severely damage reproductive organs, cause cancer and damage the immune system. The new research analysed the prospects for killer whale populations over the next century and found those offshore from industrialised nations could vanish as soon as years. Among those most at risk are the UK last pod , where a recent death revealed one of the highest PCB levels ever recorded. Others off Gibraltar, Japan and Brazil and in the north-east Pacific are also in great danger. Killer whales are one of the most widespread mammals on earth but have already been lost in the North Sea, around Spain and many other places. “It is like a killer whale apocalypse,” said Paul Jepson at the Zoological Society of London, part of the international research team behind the new study. “Even in a pristine condition they are very slow to reproduce.” Healthy killer whales take years to reach peak sexual maturity and months to gestate a calf. PCBs were used around the world since the in electrical components, plastics and paints but their toxicity has been known for years. They were banned by nations in the and but of the tonnes produced have yet to be destroyed and are still leaking into the seas from landfills and other sources. The international Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants came into force in to tackle the issue, but Jepson said the clean-up is way behind schedule. “I think the Stockholm Convention is failing,” he said. “The only area where I am optimistic is the US. They alone produced of all PCBs, but they have been getting PCB levels down consistently for decades. All we have done in Europe is ban them and then hope they go away.” The researchers said PCBs are just one pollutant found in killer whales, with “a long list of additional known and as yet unmeasured contaminants present”. Further problems for killer whales include the loss of key prey species such as tuna and sharks to overfishing and also growing underwater noise pollution. The new research, published in the journal Science , examined PCB contamination in killer whales, the largest analysis yet. The scientists then took existing data on how PCBs affect calf survival and immune systems in whales and used this to model how populations will fare in the future. “Populations of Japan, Brazil, Northeast Pacific, Strait of Gibraltar, and the United Kingdom are all tending toward complete collapse,” they concluded. Lucy Babey, deputy director at conservation group Orca , said: “Our abysmal failures to control chemical pollution ending up in our oceans has caused a killer whale catastrophe on an epic scale. It is essential that requirements to dispose safely of PCBs under the Stockholm Convention are made legally binding at the next meeting in May to help stop this scandal.” Scientists have previously found “extraordinary” levels of toxic pollution even in the Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean. Mariana trench live feed: engrossing viewing from deepest place on Earth “This new study is a global red alert on the state of our oceans,” said Jennifer Lonsdale, chair of the Wildlife and Countryside Link whales group. “If the UK government wants its [proposed] Environment Act to be world-leading, it must set ambitious targets on PCB disposal and protect against further chemical pollution of our waters.” The research shows that killer whale populations in the high north, off Norway, Iceland, Canada and the Faroes, are far less contaminated due to their distance from major PCB sources. ”The only thing that gives me hope about killer whales in the longer term is, yes, we are going to lose populations all over the industrialised areas, but there are populations that are doing reasonably well in the Arctic,” said Jepson. If a global clean-up, which would take decades, can be achieved, these populations could eventually repopulate empty regions, he said, noting that killer whales are very intelligent, have strong family bonds and hunt in packs. “It is an incredibly adaptive species – they have been able to [live] from the Arctic to the Antarctic and everywhere in between.” He praised the billion-dollar “ superfund ” clean-ups in the US, such as in the Hudson River and Puget Sound, where the polluter has paid most of the costs: “The US is going way beyond the Stockholm Convention because they know how toxic PCBs are.”",816,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/orca-apocalypse-half-of-killer-whales-doomed-to-die-from-pollution

The filter then allows the bus to blow out more pure air so that the air behind it is cleaner than that in front of it. Brown said Southampton had been chosen for the prototype as the World Health Organization revealed that the city is at its limit of unsafe air pollution . It is also one of five cities tasked with drawing up air pollution plans by the government.

45,"A huge new cruise ship terminal planned for the river Thames would lead to a surge in dangerous levels of air pollution in the heart of the capital with unknown health consequences for hundreds of thousands of people, campaigners have warned. Under the proposals, which have been given planning permission, up to giant cruise ships would dock in London every year. Each ship would need to run its diesel engines round the clock to power onboard facilities, generating the same amount of toxic emissions as almost continuously running lorries . “As we find out more about the damage air pollution is doing to people health it is unthinkable that something like this can go ahead ,” said local resident Laura Eyres, who is one of those leading the fight against the development . “There is simply no justification for having these huge ships sitting here right next to busy residential areas and schools , belching out this level of pollution with all the associated damage to people health that have now been proven.” There has been growing concern about the scale of the air pollution crisis in recent months. A slew of new research has highlighted the health risks associated with toxic air – from reduced intelligence to a rise in asthma deaths ; heart disease to spikes in Alzheimer disease and dementia . In London, the mayor, Sadiq Khan, has announced a range of measures including plans to introduce a low emissions zone banning the most polluting road vehicles from a large swath of the city from However, the Thames does not fall under his jurisdiction and campaigners fear it has become a “wild west” in terms of air pollution. “The fumes that are emitted on the river simply would not be allowed if they were coming from a road in London ,” said Eyres. “It is really worrying to think what damage these fumes are causing local residents, and if the new terminal goes ahead that is only going to get a lot worse.” The Port of London Authority (PLA) controls traffic on the Thames and admits the “marine sector” has lagged behind in terms of tackling air pollution. However, it says it is catching up and earlier this year it produced its first air quality strategy . It points out that the Thames is only responsible for of London air pollution and says emission levels will improve in the years ahead as clean marine technology comes into force. Martin Garside from the PLA said it was working with the the mayor and local authorities “to secure strong environmental standards”. He added: “With a single barge carrying the loads of lorries – the Thames helps reduce traffic and pollution on London congested roads. Over four million tonnes of cargo is transported between river terminals – removing about lorry movements from the roads.” The proposed new cruise terminal at Enderby Wharf in Greenwich is owned by Morgan Stanley , which was given planning permission for the terminal and wider residential development by Greenwich council in and updated permission in Now the council has changed its mind and is backing campaigners’ calls for Morgan Stanley to come up with a greener alternative for the cruise terminal. Residents want it to be “zero emissions”, only allowing ships that can plug into an onshore power point so they can turn off their polluting diesel engines. Eyres said: “With cruise ships planned annually and each staying for three days we face huge amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter being released into our homes every day of the summer with potentially devastating health implications.” One of the big cruise ship companies, Viking, said its ships were already fitted with the “latest technology that meets the strictest environmental regulations”. A spokesman added: “If shore side power were available then we would consider using it. In fact, we are already prepared to use shore power. Our newest ship, launched this year, has a built-in connection, and we are updating our other four ships to use shore power in order to have the capability fleetwide.” Campaigners wrote to Morgan Stanley earlier this month raising their concerns again and arguing the current plans were at odds with the company stated commitment on environmental sustainability. A spokesperson for the company said it had received the letter and was working on revised plans for the development. “We acknowledge East Greenwich Residents Association concerns and can assure [them] that our new proposals will take these concerns into account.” However, Eyres said local residents needed more than encouraging words. “We can’t rest until we see a concrete commitment from Morgan Stanley that their plans for a polluting cruise port are dead in the water.”",785,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/air-pollution-fears-fuel-fight-against-huge-new-london-cruise-ship-terminal-river-thames
46,"rom a tiny office on the top floor of the old town hall in Catford, south-east London, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah is leading a campaign to push air pollution on to the political agenda as never before. It has been claimed for years that pollution caused by motor vehicles, especially diesel cars, buses and lorries, is a killer, with talk of tens of thousands of premature deaths . But the number was always abstract, the identities of the dead unknown. Now, for the first time, campaigners have the name of a young victim they say died as a direct result of air pollution: Ella Roberta Kissi-Debrah, Rosamund daughter, and if they can prove it they believe an invisible killer will become all too real. Ella, who suffered from severe asthma, died in at the age of nine . She had been suffering asthma-related seizures like the one which killed her for three years. Kissi-Debrah says her daughter, who grew up and went to school close to the busy South Circular Road in Lewisham, had cough syncope – a condition usually associated with long-distance lorry drivers who’d been driving for decades. “I couldn’t work out why a nine-year-old child should have that,” she tells me. While Ella was alive, Kissi-Debrah sought a medical explanation for the condition. Now she is convinced it was related to air pollution, arguing that her daughter lungs had been weakened over the course of her short life, with pollution spikes then triggering the attacks that repeatedly hospitalised her in the final three years. “When she first became ill, I just went to the GP and got normal antibiotics and thought ‘a few days and that will be it’,” recalls Kissi-Debrah. “But she developed this cough and it was really strange-sounding, like a whooping cough.” The cough persisted. On the third visit to the surgery the doctor referred her to a specialist, and eventually Great Ormond Street took over Ella treatment. “By New Year Eve she was in intensive care,” says Kissi-Debrah. “It now turns out that all we were doing for the next two years was maintaining her. She would have times when the cough disappeared, but it was never long enough.” Kissi-Debrah contends that the damage her daughter suffered to her lungs in the early years of her life condemned her to death. Supported by the human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn , Kissi-Debrah is pressing for a new inquest into her daughter death that for the first time would make it explicit that pollution was the cause. To get a second inquest, they will need to show there is new evidence that was not taken into account at the original investigation in Step forward Stephen Holgate, professor of immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton, who has taken a fresh look at Ella medical records and concluded there is a “real prospect that without illegal levels of air pollution Ella would not have died”. On the basis of his findings, Cockburn – a partner at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen who represented Neville Lawrence in his fight to get the director of public prosecutions to reopen the investigation into his son Stephen murder – has written to the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox , to ask for a new inquest. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has given public backing to the call , and a response is expected from Cox in the next month. Even if he turns it down, Cockburn, who is herself asthmatic and took an interest in the issue of air pollution long before she started acting for Kissi-Debrah, says she will press ahead with a judicial review of the case, believing it to have far-reaching human rights implications. “We have met a lot of hurdles along the way,” Cockburn tells me, “because although there has been evidence that air pollution kills, which is acknowledged by experts and even the government, we’ve found a reluctance to consider it on an individual, personal basis.” Cockburn wants the terms of the new inquest to be as broad as possible: “We think it should be a human rights inquest – one of the wider type of inquests based on article of the European&nbsp;Convention&nbsp;on&nbsp;Human Rights, which is the right to life. It important to identify whether state activity was relevant to the death and what lessons can be learned to prevent future fatalities.” At that point, the personal becomes deeply political. London and many other towns and cities in the UK routinely breach EU guidelines on safety limits for nitrogen dioxide which comes mainly from diesel vehicle exhausts. They are similarly lax in observing World Health Organi zation -recommended levels on fine-particle pollution. Particulate matter , to use the academic term, comes mainly from diesel and petrol vehicle engines, brakes and the contact between tyres and the road. The particles, called PM and PM according to size, are impossible to see with the naked eye but can be deadly. They penetrate the lungs and cardiovascular system and have been linked to strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory infections. If the government failure to meet pollution limits could be tied to specific deaths, it would potentially be liable to claims for compensation. Hence, no doubt, the reluctance to move from acceptance of tens of thousands of abstract deaths to the identification of any concrete, named ones. “This is a health crisis,” says Sarah MacFadyen, head of policy at the British Lung Foundation. “People don’t always think of it in that way because it is invisible. If it was unhealthy food or dirty water coming out of the taps we would see it. The kind of air pollution that we had in the past and that everybody remembers – the great smogs – again we could see it; we could see the air that we were breathing. “But we had a Clean Air Act; we cleaned up factories, we cleaned up our industry, so you don’t get that pollution any more. Instead the pollution in our air, which in town and city centres is largely from vehicle exhausts, is invisible.” Kissi-Debrah stood for the Green party in the byelection in Lewisham East in June, coming fourth. Reducing air pollution is a central policy for the party, which sees Ella case as a potential game-changer. “If air pollution is put on the death certificate of a child who has died, that – in political and policy terms – has huge ramifications,” says London assembly member Caroline Russell, Green party national spokesperson for transport. “It would be absolutely unprecedented.” Russell says the move from purely “statistical” deaths to real deaths would encourage the revolution in thinking needed to combat air pollution. “One of the problems with getting the government to take air pollution seriously, getting the mayor [of London] to take air pollution seriously, is that the action that needs to be taken so that everyone can trust the air they breathe is pretty radical,” she says. “It is about rethinking our transport system so that everyone has access to affordable, regular and efficient public transport and are not car-dependent. That kind of transport change is difficult to bring about: we have a car-dependent culture, politicians who are frightened of the motorist, and a press that is very motor-centric.” Linking the mayor approach to air pollution with the government is perhaps unfair. Khan, who is himself asthmatic and has children who suffer from asthma, has made reducing air pollution a key policy – hence his support for Kissi-Debrah campaign for a new inquest. “London lethal air is one of the biggest health challenges of this generation,” he said last November when announcing a new central London clean air zone to be launched next year that will levy charges on high-polluting diesel vehicles. “We can’t continue breathing in air so toxic it harms children lung development and causes chronic illness and premature death.” Russell accepts the mayor is making progress but thinks he could do more. “He could consider taking the ultra-low emission zone to the so that every Londoner is covered,” she says. “He also stuck with the old-fashioned system of a cordon around an area where you pay a fixed, chunky fee to drive a non-compliant car into that area. Road pricing would be a much better and more flexible option.” “Sadiq made air pollution a key plank of his manifesto,” counters Shirley Rodrigues, London deputy mayor for environment and energy, “and as soon as he came in, one of his first actions was to support [environmental pressure group] ClientEarth legal action against the government on air quality . It about the impact on people daily lives. Most poorer communities are living on main roads, so the mayor sees this as a social justice and a health issue, not just as an environmental issue.” This summer slew of stories about the harmful effects of air pollution has hit home. New research has linked it with reduced intelligence , with changes in the structure of the heart consistent with the early stages of heart failure , and now with damage to the placentas of pregnant women and the onset of dementia . The charity Living Streets says the issue is rapidly rising up the list of public concerns. “People are definitely becoming more aware of it,” says spokeswoman Kathryn Shaw, “and parents are thinking about it when choosing schools for their children.” “The invisible is finally becoming more visible, because there has been concerted action to bring it to the attention of both the public and the politicians,” says Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King College London and chairman of the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants . “The evidence base regarding the impact of these different pollutants on health has been pretty robust for at least a decade, but the challenge has been getting it into people perception that this is an issue which affects them and their children health. But it also an issue that they are intimately involved in because they are part of the problem. They contribute to the pollution we have in our cities.” He suggests three reasons for rising awareness of air pollution over the past couple of years: the BBC starting to include air quality information in its weather forecasts, ClientEarth court victories against the government over its failure to meet EU pollution limits, and the Volkswagen “dieselgate” scandal , when it it was revealed that the carmaker was doctoring the results of laboratory tests to make its diesel vehicles appear less polluting than they were. Dieselgate was a disaster for Volkswagen and for diesel cars generally, sales of which have since fallen dramatically . Before the Volkswagen scandal the government had been actively encouraging drivers to switch to diesel cars, believing them to be more fuel-efficient and less harmful to the environment because they produce less carbon dioxide Governments offered incentives to motorists to buy diesels and sales increased considerably. Those motorists were literally taken for a ride. Now the damaging effects of diesel cars on health and the foolishness of using them in cities are understood, sales are plummeting. It an unpleasant choice – more using diesel or more using petrol. There is already evidence that the switch back to petrol cars is increasing emissions, a problem highlighted by Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. and climate change appears to be an issue forgotten by some,” says Hawes. “Because diesel cars typically consume less fuel than petrol equivalents, they emit on average less Without modern diesels on the roads, coupled with a slow uptake of alternatively fuelled vehicles, it will be increasingly difficult to meet tough EU targets and deliver shared ambitions on climate change.” Rod Dennis at motoring organisation the RAC reckons motorists are now thoroughly confused about what they should be buying. “Most drivers have little awareness of how polluting their present car, or one they are thinking of leasing or purchasing, really is,” he says. “There is a large job to do in educating drivers about the best type of vehicle for them, in terms of the type of driving they do, their budget and what is best for the environment. “Today, there is no single source of information that allows a driver to look up to what emissions standard their vehicle conforms. Without these basic tools, it will be very difficult to persuade motorists to take more ownership of the emissions for which they are responsible, and therefore more difficult to persuade them to move to a lower emissions vehicle.” Prof Kelly says the government is still dragging its feet on introducing policies that would make dramatic improvements to air quality, and points out that successive reports by the parliamentary environment committee have condemned government inaction. “Despite mounting evidence of the costly health and environmental impacts of air pollution,” said one report in , “we see little evidence of a cohesive cross-government plan to tackle emissions.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) defends the government record. “ Air quality has improved significantly in recent years,” she says. “Nitrogen oxide emissions have fallen by But we recognise there is more to do. That is why we are taking comprehensive action through our ambitious new clean air strategy. By ending the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans by we are also acting faster to tackle air pollution than almost every other major developed economy.” But as critics like to point out, is a long way off, and by then none of the present generation of politicians will be around to be held accountable for meeting – or missing – the target. After Brexit the UK government, rather than the EU commission, will be responsible for legal standards on air pollution in the UK. Could this, as some fear, be an opportunity to relax safeguards and lower safety limits? Defra insists this will not be the case. “The EU (Withdrawal) Act ensures that existing EU environmental law continues to have effect in UK law after exit,” says the spokeswoman, “and the forthcoming environment bill will include provisions to improve air quality.” As that legislation passes through parliament next year, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah hopes to be back in a coroner court trying to prove that air pollution killed her daughter. If she does, it would be a crucial milestone for clean air campaigners, and the government timescale for ending the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles might have to be speeded up. Kelly committee estimates that nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter are responsible for between and premature deaths a year in the UK. If correct, that would make it the number two public health killer after smoking, and a bigger cause of premature death than alcohol and obesity. But these are just numbers, lifeless statistics; Ella, until asthma immobilised her, was a vibrant, sporty, life-loving little girl, which is why a new inquest could change everything. “No one gets ‘Died from air pollution’ on their death certificate,” says Kelly, “and if her death can be solidly linked, it would be a big step forward.” The view from the street I recently took a walk along two of London most polluted streets – Marylebone Road in central London, which according to one recent report has the highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide in Britain, and Brixton Road in south London , another hotspot, notorious for breaching its annual pollution limits within days of the start of each new year. The responses I received when I asked people about the UK “invisible killer” demonstrated that the dangers of air pollution are now clearly understood. “It bothers me hugely that I have to breathe this,” says Peter, who has run a stall selling coffee next to Marylebone Road for six years, “but I’m not in an economic position to be able to do anything about it. This is my own business and I’ve put a lot of money into it. I just have to live with it.” Why not wear a mask? “I’d look like a Millwall fan from the he replies. “It not really going to encourage people to buy any coffee.” Chloe, who lives in a street close to the Marylebone flyover, where the vehicles are backed up and you really can smell the fumes, does intend to do something about it. “I’m living with a friend but I’m going to move away because of the pollution,” she says. “I’m very aware things get dirty quickly around here.” David, a lawyer who is having a cigarette outside Westminster magistrates court, also dislikes the road. “The pollution bothers me enormously,” he says. “It bad in much of London. The idea that there is no escape from polluted air is the thing I like least about living in this city.” On Brixton Road, Antina, who is wearing a mask (though mainly to ward off germs, she says), says her teenage daughter has educated her about the dangers of air pollution. She is with her friend Joe, who works in Brixton. Joe, who is asthmatic and says he sometimes suffers badly from its effects, suggests cheaper tube tickets and pro-bike initiatives to combat the problem. “Air pollution harms everybody,” he says. “We have to look at the long-term effects.” “I went down to Somerset on holiday recently,” says a young woman called Sydney who lives locally. “I found I could breathe a lot better in the country air, and coming back was like being choked.” “I don’t think there enough public pressure on politicians,” says her friend Luka. “We don’t push enough to show this is how much damage we’re doing. It needs to get talked about",2947,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/22/invisible-killer-how-one-girls-tragic-death-could-change-the-air-pollution-story
47,"Your report ( School run is the ‘biggest polluter’ of air children breathe , September) highlights the continuing failure of government to recognise the dangers of air pollution, specifically from diesel engines, and to take necessary action to limit the number of premature deaths. But the school run is only part of the problem facing infants, children and the wider population. Many schools are on what are now extremely busy roads; only a minority have had an air pollution survey; and because of austerity measures they seldom have the resources to take remedial action by acquiring air purifiers. School buses keep their diesel engines ticking over for half an hour or longer and legal restrictions are simply ignored by bus companies and the police. Ice-cream vans in public parks and holiday resorts are diesel-powered, but they keep their engines running all day, even when located near children playgrounds. The implications are worrying: key public health issues are not prioritised and there is only a limited willingness to impose legislation – for example, why are school buses, ice-cream vans and taxis not required to be electric-powered? The health consequences are unacceptable in terms of reduced life expectancy, but they are also class-specific, as many of the older schools were built in working-class areas, aggravating the widening health differential between the rich and the poor. Professor Robert Lee Birkenhead, Merseyside Parents or grandparents appear to believe they are protecting children by taking them to school by car. But last year you reported that “A range of experiments, some as far back as have shown that drivers inside vehicles are exposed to far higher levels of air pollution than those walking or cycling along the same urban routes” ( Children in cars ‘at far greater risk from fumes’ than walking , June Your report quoted Prof Stephen Holgate as saying air pollution “is nine to times higher inside the car than outside”. Why not organise a “walking bus”, if you live close to the school, or, if it too far, drive them part of the way towards it, park the car and walk with them to the school? Dr Wiebina Heesterman Birmingham Each month brings new evidence of the health effects of exposure to particulates ( High pollution levels ‘causing huge reduction in intelligence’ , August). Now even the womb is not safe ( Toxic air may reach placentas, study finds , September). Thirty years ago this month the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations brought a breath of fresh air to the UK workplace. But this COSHH has since become a blunt instrument; while environmental air quality standards become ever more stringent, occupational limits gather dust. Dusts in workplaces can differ from ambient environments, but it can’t be right that a worker can now legitimately breathe in levels within the workplace times higher than is permissible on the pavement outside. The cognitive deficit from a lifetime occupational exposure to the UK limit for so-called “nuisance” dust could be equivalent to leaving school at age All dusts that can reach the lung are now known to increase cancer risk, yet we cannot formally call them carcinogenic. By law the smokers’ shack is outside the factory, but breathing the dust inside the workplace may equate to a few passive fags’ worth every shift. The research is piling up, but while consumer powers advance, the rights of workers to fresh air appear to have bitten the dust. Dr Brian Gardner Glasgow On your front page with a headline about toxic air reaching placentas there was also a trail for the feature by David Sedaris on “ The joy of city walks ”. Shouldn’t there have been a health warning accompanying this? Bernard Lancaster Mansfield, Nottinghamshire Jon Vidal is absolutely right in that substantially curbing car use in cities and towns will reduce air pollution ( We have an air pollution crisis. It time to leave the car at home , September). But although measures such as pedestrianisation will help, road pricing would have the greatest impact. Using modern tracking technology, pricing could be greater at times of greatest congestion and in areas of greatest pollution. Road tax could be reduced to a notional amount, with drivers paying more if they drive more. The resulting revenue could be used to support buses, trains, cycling etc. Mike Parker Chair, Don’t Choke Britain Leaving the car at home may well help reduce local air pollution, but could exacerbate another damaging impact of our car-dependent society – the paving over of front gardens to provide parking. Electric vehicles may even accelerate the growth in this trend if car ownership increases with decreasing fuel costs, and the front drive&nbsp;becomes a convenient charging point. Green spaces make our cities liveable and already at least a quarter of UK front gardens in England are completely paved over. Time to green our cities and promote walking, cycling and better public transport. Dr Ruth Gelletlie Leeds When I wrote to both Sir Michael Wilshaw and Justine Greening MP in about air pollution wrecking health and reducing IQ, both Ofsted and the Department for Education replied that air pollution was outside their remit and a matter for Defra. No government department will get involved in an issue that within the remit of another, and unless and until teachers, school staff and parents push for a change in that archaic system and get some action on the air pollution crisis, teachers and others who manage to reach retirement age can look forward to worse health and earlier deaths.

48,"New petrol and diesel car sales in Europe must be phased out before if the auto sector is to play its part in holding global warming to the Paris agreement goal, a new analysis has found. Forecourt plug-in hybrids will also have to disappear by at the latest, according to analysis by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), commissioned by Greenpeace. Vehicle emissions have barely changed over the last decade and the industry will exhaust its carbon budget within five to years unless there is a radical shift, the DLR scientists say. “Auto need to peak as soon as possible,” Prof Horst Friedrich, DLR director, told the Guardian. “Looking at the dwindling carbon budget it is crucial to push low-emitting cars into the market, the earlier the better, to renew the fleet.” The study warns that “stark measures” would be needed to do this with a chance of meeting the goal – including a drop in conventional car sales from around this year to in Under this scenario, the last vehicle with an internal combustion engine would be sold in and diesel and petrol powered-cars would be banished from the roads by the Behavioural change towards walking, cycling and public transport would also be necessary. “It would be much easier to keep a target because there is a higher carbon budget and therefore more time to implement the necessary measures,” Friedrich said. “I estimate it could provide us with up to years more time to prepare much better for the fundamental transformations necessary.” A draft report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes clear that of warming would expose around million more people in coastal areas to floods, storm surges and crop damage than would. Global sea levels would also rise by an extra , heatwaves would be longer, extreme weather events stronger, economic growth lower, while crop yields and water availability would substantially decline. So far, the European commission has proposed a cut in vehicle emissions by although MEPs are pushing to raise that figure to . The UK government has announced that sales of all new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned by , while some countries including Germany, Ireland, India and the Netherlands have set a more ambitious deadline of Energy utilities have often led calls for greater ambition and Kristian Ruby, the secretary general of Eurelectric , the power sector trade association, said that the current EU proposal was “not in line with the Paris objectives”. He told the Guardian: “The timeline of a full phase out by does sound quite ambitious. Car makers are only ramping up now for around new electric models that will come to market next year. But this needs to happen, and faster than currently seen by the European commission. There is no doubt about that.” Some analysts also believe that Europe car manufacturers have made no real-world improvement in auto emissions for five years, because of the “gaming” of emissions tests. A spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said: “It is still hard to predict whether the alternative powertrains will have gained a significantly high market share by This is dependent on factors that are outside the control of automobile manufacturers, such as the necessary recharging infrastructure being in place as well appropriate incentives.”",547,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/20/eu-must-end-new-petrol-and-diesel-car-sales-by-2030-to-meet-climate-targets-report
49,"Microplastic can escape from polluted waters via flying insects, new research has revealed, contaminating new environments and threatening birds and other creatures that eat the insects. Scientists fed microplastics to mosquito larvae, which live in water, but found that the particles remained inside the animals as they transformed into flying adults. Other recent research found that half of the mayfly and caddisfly larvae in rivers in Wales contained microplastics. Concern over microplastic pollution is rising rapidly as it is discovered in ever more places, and very little research has been done on how it may harm wildlife or humans. The particles can harbour bacteria or leach toxic chemicals. Microplastics have been found in tapwater around the world , in vast numbers in the oceans and sea creatures and even in remote Swiss mountains . “It is a shocking reality that plastic is contaminating almost every corner of the environment and its ecosystems,” said Prof Amanda Callaghan, at the University of Reading, UK, who led the new research on mosquitoes. “Much recent attention has been given to the plastics polluting our oceans, but this research reveals it is also in our skies.” The new study, published in the journal Biology Letters , used Culex pipiens mosquitoes, as they are found across the world in many habitats. The researchers found the larvae readily consumed fluorescent microplastic particles that were in size. “Larvae are filter feeders that waft little combs towards their mouths, so they can’t actually distinguish between a bit of plastic and a bit of food,” Callaghan said. “They eat algae, which are more or less the same size as these microplastics.” The larvae matured into a non-feeding pupa stage and then emerged as adult mosquitoes, which still had significant microplastic within them. The researchers are now studying if this damages the mosquitoes. Callaghan said it is “highly likely” that other flying insects that begin as water larvae will also eat and retain microplastics. Birds, bats and spiders are among the species that eat large numbers of insects, suggesting these are also consuming microplastics. “You can get swarms of insects,” she said. “You could have a lot of plastic going up. It totally depressing. These plastics are going to be around forever.” Plastics have been found inside many seabirds , but this is the first research suggesting terrestrial birds that eat insects are at risk. “This is a new pathway to get plastics up in the air and expose animals that are not normally exposed,” said Callaghan. “We don’t know what the impact will be.” Matt Shardlow, chief executive of the conservation charity Buglife, said: “Aquatic insects are in the microplastic front line. We emit billions of plastic fibres every year, many of which go straight into rivers, so there is an urgent need for more research into the role microplastics may be playing in observed declines in aquatic life.” Many microplastics are fibres shed by synthetic clothing during washing – a single wash can release fibres . “While research proceeds, we can all think carefully about our clothing choices,” said Shardlow. Other microplastics are formed by the abrasion of larger pieces of plastic in rivers and oceans. Large pieces of plastic are easily seen and clearly harm animals, from turtles to albatrosses . But research has also found microplastics, defined as smaller than in many marine creatures, from worms to plankton and up the food chain to fish . Where investigated, they have been shown to damage the health of the animals . Like the oceans, freshwater rivers and lakes are also heavily contaminated – a river near Manchester, UK, has the worst microplastic pollution yet recorded – but the impact on wildlife in these habitats has been much less studied. The research in the Welsh rivers found microplastics in larvae both upstream and downstream from wastewater treatment plants, indicating that plastic pollution enters rivers directly, not just via sewage. The researchers, led by Prof Steve Ormerod at Cardiff University, said the overall dearth of data on the effect of microplastics on freshwater creatures means that the understanding of the risk to the ecosystem remains “seriously limited”. It is widely accepted that humans are also consuming microplastics. “We all eat them, there no doubt about it,” said Callaghan. Eating seafood such as mussels or cod is one route, while beer , sugar and sea salt have all been found to contain microplastics. Exposure is likely to rise, as plastic production is expected to climb by in the next decade, prompting scientists to call for urgent research on the effects of microplastics on people.",763,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/19/microplastics-can-spread-via-flying-insects-research-shows
50,"Air pollution may increase the chance of developing dementia, a study has suggested, in fresh evidence that the health of people of all ages is at risk from breathing dirty air. People over in areas with the highest levels of nitrogen oxide in the air showed a greater risk of developing dementia than those with the least NOx pollution, according to the research, based on data from London . The observational study, published in the BMJ Open journal on Wednesday, cannot establish that air pollution was a direct cause of the dementia cases. However, the authors said the link between higher pollution and higher levels of dementia diagnosis could not be explained by other factors known to raise risks of the disease. The Guardian view on clean air zones: cities must be bold | Editorial Air pollution has already been linked with cardiovascular and respiratory disease, but this is one of the first studies to examine links with neurodegenerative illness. Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King College London and one of the authors of the paper, told the Guardian: “The study outcome suggests a linkage [between air pollution and dementia] but cannot inform on the cause. However, I believe that we now have sufficient knowledge to add air pollution to the list of risk factors for dementia. Our calculations suggest that it elevates risk by so [that would suggest] approximately of the total dementia cases in the UK, in mathematical terms.” The new findings add to a growing body of recent research on the wide-ranging effects of air pollution . Earlier this week, Unicef warned of the risk to children from the “toxic” school run , while evidence that particles of pollutants can cross into placentas has just been published. A ground-breaking study from China recently found a “huge” reduction in intelligence associated with breathing dirty air , equivalent to losing a year education. The Kings College London study adds to previous research suggesting a link with dementia, but scientists warned that the results must be taken cautiously because the observational study could not closely track other possible causes such as lifestyle factors or the relative economic deprivation of the patients studied, or the amount of air pollution each was subject to individually. The study used estimates of air and noise pollution levels across London and correlated these with anonymised patient health records for patients aged between and at GP practices within the Their health was tracked for seven years from during which period of the patients were diagnosed with dementia. Their exposure to air pollution was estimated based on their home postcodes. Martie Van Tongeren, a professor of occupational and environmental health at Manchester University, who was not involved, said: “There is a growing body of evidence of the link between air pollution and brain health, including dementia and Alzheimer. This study adds to this body of evidence and fits with some of the previous studies. As most people in the UK live in urban areas, exposure to traffic-related and other air pollutants is ubiquitous. Hence, even a relatively small increase in risk will result in a large public health impact.” The paper authors said a link between poor air quality and dementia could begin early in life. They wrote: “Traffic related air pollution has been [linked to] poorer cognitive development in young children, and continued significant exposure may produce neuroinflammation and altered brain innate immune responses in early adulthood.” Campaigners called on the government to take urgent action on air pollution. Simon Alcock, head of UK public affairs for ClientEarth, which has repeatedly taken the government to court over its failures on air quality, called for a national clean air bill backed by an independent watchdog, and clean air zones in the most polluted areas. He said: “Air pollution is damaging our health from the womb to old age. It is unacceptable in for people to be risking dementia just by breathing.” Road traffic should be the focus of efforts to clean up our air, as it is the leading cause of the health problems, added Aaron Kiely, air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Efforts to clean up our cars, vans and lorries must be put in the fast lane – we can’t afford to wait until for most new vehicles to be zero-emission,” he said. “Greater investment is also needed in alternatives to motor vehicles, such as safer cycling infrastructure, and affordable and convenient public transport.” A Defra spokesperson said levels of air pollution, including NOx, had fallen and the government was taking further action: “By ending the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans by we are acting faster to tackle air pollution than almost every other major developed economy.” Labour slammed ministers for failing to address air pollution, which regularly exceeds legal limits in many areas, particularly in London. Sue Hayman, shadow environment secretary, said: “It is simply not good enough for Michael Gove to shunt this problem on to cash-strapped local councils, publish strategies on wood burners and drag his feet on new legislation. [We] would bring forward a new Clean Air Act and a network of clean air zones to tackle the UK illegal levels of air pollution in the quickest time possible.”",877,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/air-pollution-causes-jump-in-dementia-risk-study-suggests

Environmental advocates said retracting the regulation would contribute to global warming and cause more smog-forming pollution that can cause heart and lung illnesses. But the interior department deputy secretary, David Bernhardt, called the Obama-era rule “flawed” and “a radical assertion of legal authority” in a news release. EPA admits scrapping regulations will put more methane into atmosphere The rule regulated flaring, leaking and venting natural gas on US federal and Native American tribal lands.

Conrad Schneider, advocacy director for that organization, said the Obama era rule also would have saved companies money once they made the initial investments to comply with it. “This is the public gas,” Schneider said. “Any sort of waste here is basically burning up the public resource.” In a separate action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last week finalized a plan to eliminate the Obama administration requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and fix methane leaks for new operations.",276,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/epa-methane-pollution-rule-rolled-back-health-warning
52,"The United States, Russia and other Arctic nations signed an agreement on Thursday to bar their fishing fleets from fast-thawing seas around the north pole. The accord, also signed in Oslo by the ambassadors of Canada, Norway and Denmark, is a response to global warming, which is melting sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean, an area the size of the Mediterranean. The deal had been delayed by more than a year by tensions over Ukraine. The central Arctic probably has no commercial fish stocks now, experts say, but melting sea ice may draw fish such as cod farther north. Forty percent of the area was briefly open water when summer sea ice shrank to a record low in The deal “will prevent a problem from arising ahead of time,” said David Balton, US deputy assistant secretary of state for oceans and fisheries. “Very little is known about this area of the ocean.” “Climate change is affecting the migration patterns of fish stocks,” Norwegian foreign minister Boerge Brende said in a statement. He said Arctic states had a responsibility to protect the international waters, starting nautical miles miles) from their coasts. Thursday accord was negotiated in outline in Greenland in February to be signed in June But Russian president Vladimir Putin annexed Ukraine Crimea region in March and in protest, both the United States and Canada boycotted one meeting of the Arctic Council last year in Moscow. That protest “was the exception to the rule” of cooperation in the Arctic, Balton said. Many other Arctic activities have remained on track with Russia, such as exercises linked to search and rescue and oil spills. The Arctic states also want other major fishing nations – such as China, Vietnam, South Korea and all European Union states – to agree not to venture into the central Arctic Ocean. “It a new ocean emerging,” said Scott Highleyman, director of international Arctic affairs at the Pew Charitable Trusts environmental group. “It hugely encouraging – it hard to get governments’ attention for problems that haven’t occurred yet.” Greenpeace Arctic campaigner, Sophie Allain said that the agreement should have gone further: “With this agreement the Arctic States have recognised that the Arctic Ocean is an extraordinary environment which requires far better scientific understanding. But sadly they have missed the chance to deliver the permanent protection this area desperately needs ... This region should be declared a marine sanctuary, where all extractive practices, including oil production, are banned.” Thursday agreement also called for more research into the Arctic marine resources. The first fish likely to thrive are Arctic cod, also known as polar cod, which have a natural anti-freeze in their blood, said Alf Haakon Hoen, research director at the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research. But authorities should be wary of allowing trawlers into the area, because of the threat to other species, such as polar bears, whales, seals and seabirds, he said.

53,"The European commission has unveiled new proposals for limits on carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars and vans, which would compel manufacturers to cut emissions from their vehicles by nearly a third from But the proposals will not require manufacturers to make a fixed quota of their fleet run on electricity, as some campaigners had hoped. The commission said the new standards would help the bloc meet its targets on greenhouse gas reduction under the Paris agreement, and “put the EU back in the race” for global leadership on clean vehicle technology. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU commissioner for climate action, said: “Europe invented the car. And it had a good run: it modernised our economy and changed our society. But the car as we know is reaching its limits. It now time for Europe to re-invent it.” He said the global race to develop clean cars was “an irreversible trend” and that the new proposals would help Europe to lead it. “We need the right measures and the right incentives.” The announcement came as world governments met in Bonn, Germany, to discuss the implementation of the Paris agreement on climate change, including ways to raise countries’ emissions-cutting targets, which according to scientific advice are currently too low to protect the world from the likely effects of global warming. The new emissions standards, if accepted, would apply to manufacturers’ entire fleets. This means that carmakers can continue to produce high-end petrol-guzzling machines, as long as they offset this with lower-emission vehicles, such as electric cars, at the other end of the scale. Emissions from fleets of new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles will have to be lower in compared to However, critics said these targets were too low, and that the commission had failed to learn the lessons from the diesel scandal . Ansgar Kiene, EU climate policy director at Greenpeace, said and entirely different approach was needed instead of seeking to make current technology somewhat more efficient: “These measures are fundamentally held back by the century obsession with the passenger car and combustion engine. Cities and governments across Europe are way ahead of the game [for instance on restrictions on cars in city centres].” Karima Delli, chairman of the European parliament transport committee, which will have a chance to discuss the proposals, said the commission had yielded to the lobbying of German industry, and that the regulations fell short of what is needed to meet the Paris agreement. “This gift to the automotive industry is poisoned, not only because it hinders modernisation – needed to ensure [the industry] long-term viability – but also because it delays the implementation of policies accompanying this conversion.” She also condemned the commission for refusing to set tough standards requiring the manufacture of zero-emissions vehicles, such as electric cars. “By setting non-binding targets, the commission collects loopholes. It delays innovation and the development of electric vehicles.” Transport and Environment, the umbrella group for NGOs in this area, also criticised the proposals. Greg Archer, clean vehicles director, said: “The commission has gifted the car industry an ineffective regulation after they came calling. Removing the penalty for failing to meet zero-emission vehicle targets is an own goal. It amounts to handing global leadership on electric cars to China, which will be delighted to export their models to Europe, jeopardising jobs.” The commission has been mired in a controversy over whether it yielded to lobbying. Last month, the chief of staff to the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, denied claims he had instructed commissioners to drop sanctions that would punish carmakers for missing proposed electric vehicles. He was alleged to have done so after a call from the head of the powerful German auto manufacturers lobby. While admitting a call was made, the commission said it had been referred to the climate commissioner, Cañete. On Wednesday in Brussels, Cañete said: “The obligation of the commission is to hear everybody, every stakeholder, and have a conversation with all. And then with full independence establish our own position. There are people who want more ambition – we shall see what happens in the parliament and the council [which also have a say on the proposals].”",697,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/08/europes-carmakers-face-30-emission-cuts-target
54,"onald Trump decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal may have followed months of anguished division amongst his closest advisers, but his administration has proceeded with quiet efficiency in its dismantling of other major environmental policies. The White House, Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency have dovetailed to engineer a dizzying reversal of clean air and water regulations implemented by Barack Obama administration. Unlike the travel ban or healthcare, Trump has faced few obstacles in sweeping away what he has called “job-killing” environmental rules that address problems such as climate change, water pollution and smoggy air. “I’ve been very concerned by what I’ve seen – this is about people health,” said Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who was the EPA administrator under George W Bush, and also served as governor of New Jersey. “They are undermining science and people respect for science. They don’t seem to care.” Trump agenda has been enthusiastically spearheaded by Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the EPA, who promised in February that he would be rolling back regulations “in a very aggressive way”. Pruitt has repeatedly decried the economic cost of green strictures, especially on the coal industry, which he said was the target of a “war” from the Obama administration. Pruitt, who previously sued the EPA more than a dozen times as attorney general of Oklahoma, and has had unusually close ties to the fossil fuel industry, has helped withdraw or postpone a raft of regulations and has steered the EPA away from climate change work. While every new administration reviews or even reshapes inherited regulations – especially those enacted in the dying days of a prior presidency – the scale of the current rollback is unprecedented, according to Whitman. “We looked at or rules and we upheld them all, whereas this administration seems to think everything done in the last administration was bad,” she said. “This is the president agenda. Scott Pruitt absolutely believes in that agenda, but this is coming from the president.” Pruitt has pointed to improvements in US air quality – ozone levels dropped from to while sulfur dioxide fell over the same period – as evidence that relentless technological improvements in cars and power plants will continue to reduce pollution. But many former EPA officials have warned against using these improvements as a reason to water down protections. The soon-to-be-rewritten clean power plan, for one, was forecast to prevent premature deaths and asthma attacks nationally once up and running. “These kind of actions will put a brake on the progress we’ve seen,” said Tom Burke, who was EPA science advisor in the Obama administration and is now director of risk sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Having worked in fence-line communities and places with contaminated water, I don’t think people there are saying ‘we are clean enough, let roll things back.’ “There a very obvious shift at the EPA to make it more business-friendly. Maybe that not a bad thing for the business community, but I am very concerned this will impact the health of millions of people. “The EPA mission is to protect public health and the environment, not to protect corporate earnings. It very concerning to see.” Timeline of the rollbacks February Trump signs a bill repealing an anti-corruption rule that required energy companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. The regulation was scrapped under the Congressional Review Act. February The stream protection rule, which prevented mining companies dumping their waste into streams, is axed under the Congressional Review Act. Trump calls it a “terrible job-killing rule.” February Trump instructs the EPA to rewrite the ‘waters of the United States’ rule, which expanded the definition of the Clean Water Act to protect the water supply for around million Americans. Many farmers, real estate developers and golf course owners opposed the rule. March On March, governors and attorneys general from several Republican-led states write to Scott Pruitt to request the EPA stop collecting methane emissions data from around oil and gas operations. A day later, Pruitt says he has decided to oblige “after hearing from industry”. March Trump announces a review of vehicle fuel efficiency standards that are designed to push down greenhouse gases and other pollutants. More than a dozen car company chief executives asked the president to revisit an Obama-era decision to mandate improved fuel economy by Pruitt calls the standards “costly for automakers and the American people.” March A sweeping executive order penned by Trump orders a rewrite of the EPA clean power plan, which was Obama centerpiece climate policy, an end to the moratorium on coal mining on public land and the removal of climate change as a consideration when approving federal projects. March Pruitt denies a bid to halt the use of chlorpyrifos, a widely-used pesticide. The chemical has been linked to damage to the nervous system and last year EPA scientists said a ban was warranted. Household use of the chemical was phased out a decade ago but it is still used in farms across the US. April A court grants an EPA request to delay the implementation of ozone pollution standards that were made stricter in The EPA intends to review the rules around ozone, which is created when sunlight reacts with pollutants from vehicles exhausts and other sources. Ozone can create smogs and can trigger a raft of health ailments, especially among children, the elderly and those with respiratory problems. April The EPA pauses a regulation that curbs the dumping of toxic metals such as arsenic and mercury by power plants into public waterways. The Obama-era rule, set to commence in would’ve destroyed jobs, according to Pruitt. April The EPA successfully convinces a US appeals court to halt a challenge by states and industry groups to an Obama administration rule aimed at reducing toxic emissions from power stations. Pruitt, in his previous role as attorney general of Oklahoma, had sued the EPA to stop the rule, which is known as MATS. May A three-month pause is put on landfill methane rules so they EPA can “reconsider certain aspects” of the regulation. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and is emitted from rotting garbage in landfills, as well as other sources such as agriculture. June The EPA announces plans for a two-year pause on regulations that would reduce emissions leaks from oil and gas operators. The regulator acknowledges that pollution from the leaks results in “disproportionate” harm to children but proposes to go ahead with the suspension of the rule anyway. June The EPA, along with the US army, proposes to scrap the clean water rule . This would reverse an Obama-era move that expanded federal government protections to the drinking water of around a third of all Americans. Pruitt said the rollback will provide “regulatory certainty to our nation farmers and businesses.” The announcement didn’t reference public health.",1144,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/04/trump-emvironmental-rollback-epa-scrap-regulations
55,"The Trump administration has moved to weaken US vehicle emissions standards and has set up a major confrontation with California by scrapping its ability to enact stricter pollution standards and mandate the sale of electric cars. Elon Musk: the volatile visionary at risk of steering Tesla off the road In one of its most significant efforts yet to curtail policies designed to address climate change, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed freezing fuel efficiency standards at levels, removing the requirement that cars and light trucks be able to travel more than miles per gallon of fuel by The standard would be around miles per gallon. The reversal of an Obama-era deal with automakers in will also withdraw a waiver California has under the Clean Air Act to exceed the national standards by requiring even more efficient cars. A dozen other states and Washington DC also follow higher standards. The EPA said it wants a fuel economy” system and has claimed the reversal will have “negligible environmental impacts on air quality” and even result in thousands fewer deaths on the roads each year. The administration assertion that lighter, more fuel efficient cars are more dangerous has been disputed by transport experts. “We are delivering on President Trump promise to the American public that his administration would address and fix the current fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards,” said Andrew Wheeler, the EPA acting administrator. “Our proposal aims to strike the right regulatory balance based on the most recent information and create a solution that will enable more Americans to afford newer, safer vehicles that pollute less. More realistic standards can save lives while continuing to improve the environment.” The rollback has provoked outcry from environmental and health groups, as well as states who are pushing for cleaner vehicle fleets. States that have followed California emissions standard immediately said they will sue the EPA should the new rule be finalized. It an attack on the climate, consumers, state governments and the future viability of America auto industry Union of Concerned Scientists “The administration proposal to weaken these rules will cause the American people to breathe dirtier air and pay higher prices at the pump,” said a joint statement from attorneys general from the states, including New York, Virginia and North Carolina. “We are prepared to go to court to put the brakes on this reckless and illegal plan.” California response has been stinging. Xavier Becerra, the state attorney general, said the Trump administration had “launched a brazen attack” on California which he would fight in the courts. Jerry Brown, California governor, said the EPA move was “reckless” and a “betrayal”. Brown added: “California will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible.” Transport has become the largest sector source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, as cheap fuel has encouraged Americans to buy larger vehicles such as SUVs. In announcing the new standards in the Obama administration said the stricter rules would save around tons of greenhouse gases by as well as save Americans in fuel costs. Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator under Obama, said the reversal of these standards “run contrary to sound science and the law”. While many carmakers have touted their development of more efficient cars, including electric vehicles, auto lobbyists were quick to get assurances from the Trump administration that the more stringent rules would be dismantled. The Union of Concerned Scientists said the rollback is “completely unacceptable”. Its analysis shows the Trump administration new regime for vehicles would result in an additional tons of carbon emissions by – the equivalent of running coal-fired power plants for a year. “It an attack on the climate, consumers, state governments and the future viability of America auto industry,” said Ken Kimmell, president of UCS. “The Trump administration has decided to force America drivers to spend more at the gas pump, burn millions more barrels of oil, and put us on a path to greater harm from climate change. “The administration proposal goes beyond a simple rollback. This is a demolition, and there no scientific or technological justification for it.” Fuel efficiency standards were first introduced in and are estimated to have saved Americans more than in fuel costs since then. Some automakers and conservative critics, however, have opposed ever-increasing standards as a costly burden on industry that runs contrary to consumer demand.",724,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/02/epa-trump-vehicle-emissions-clean-car-rules
56,"A pesticide that was set to be banned before the Trump administration reversed course has been blamed for causing sickness to nearly farm workers who were exposed to the chemical in California. Spraying of Vulcan, a brand name chemical, on an orchard southwest of Bakersfield led to the pesticide drifting to a neighboring property operated by Dan Andrews Farms. A total of farm workers were harvesting cabbage at the time and subsequently complained of a bad odor, nausea and vomiting. One was taken to hospital with four other workers visiting doctors in the following days. 'Like a slow death': families fear pesticide poisoning after Trump reverses ban Glenn Fankhauser, agricultural commissioner of Kern County, said samples of cabbage and clothing have been taken to the state lab for testing. The tests are still underway to confirm the cause but the primary ingredient of Vulcan is chlorpyrifos, a toxic pesticide that was on course to be banned by the Obama administration before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided against implementing a ban in March. Dan Andrews, who runs the eponymous farm, said he doesn’t use chlorpyrifos despite it apparently infecting his workers. “Unfortunately the wind moved it onto us, I’m not quite sure how it happened, thank God everyone OK,” he told Guardian US. “There were quite a few people feeling sick, some of them vomited, so we shut down the harvest. “We are waiting for the investigation to conclude but I think they should ban (chlorpyrifos) to remove what causing the nausea. If it has had a history of incidents then it should be revisited and removed. Usually you worry about your own ranch, you don’t want to worry about other ranches. We are going to have to do due diligence before our shifts now.” Chlorpyrifos is widely used in US agriculture, sprayed on crops such as corn, wheat and citrus. However, growing evidence of its impact upon human health led the EPA to agree with the chemical industry more than a decade ago that the product should not be used indoors to get rid of household bugs. The pesticide has been linked to developmental problems in children such as lower birth weight, reduced IQ and attention disorders. Large doses of the chemical can cause convulsions and sometimes even death. People are exposed through spray drift, residues on food and water contamination. Chlorpyrifos, which is produced by Dow Chemicals, can still be used for agricultural purposes but after a legal challenge by environmental groups, EPA scientists stated that the pesticide was not safe for any use and proposed widening the ban. A subsequent ban of chlorpyrifos was rejected, however, under the new Trump administration. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the EPA, said he denied the ban to provide “regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos”. The EPA said there were “serious scientific concerns and substantive process gaps” in the plan to banish chlorpyrifos. The next review of the chemical isn’t scheduled until Farmworker Justice, a group that advocates on behalf of agricultural employees, said the EPA has become too close to large chemical companies such as Dow. “We were extremely disappointed with the EPA decision but the administration received a lot of pressure from industry and donors,” said Virginia Ruiz, director of occupational and environmental health at Farmworker Justice. “I don’t have much confidence that the current administration will end the use of chlorpyrifos.” Ruiz added: “These are the incidents we are afraid of because workers and their kids are particularly vulnerable to the effects of this pesticide. It not just the acute incidents but also low level exposures that are harmful to children. It a double standard to expect farm workers to be exposed to something that banned from homes.”",625,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/17/pesticide-trump-ban-california-farm-workers-sick
57,"Hundreds of thousands of people will be forced from their homes on low-lying islands in the next few decades by sea-level rises and the contamination of fresh drinking water sources, scientists have warned. A study by researchers at the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Deltares Institute in the Netherlands and Hawaii University has found that many small islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans will be uninhabitable for humans by the middle of this century. That is much earlier than previously thought. Experts say the findings underline the looming climate change driven migration crisis that is predicted to see hundreds of millions of people forced from their homes in the coming years. More than half a million people around the world live on atoll islands, often extraordinary and beautiful structures based on coral reefs. Their closeness to sea level makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change. The increase in urgency comes because, according to the authors of the report, previous studies had been based only on predicted sea-level rises. Today study also examined the impact of wave driven flooding on the availability of fresh water. Saltwater flooding, leading to the contamination of water sources, will see most atolls become uninhabitable sometime between and said Curt Storlazzi, USGS geologist and lead author of the new report. “The tipping point when potable groundwater on the majority of atoll islands will be unavailable is projected to be reached no later than the middle of the century.” The primary source of freshwater for populated atoll islands is rain that soaks into the ground and remains there as a layer of fresh groundwater that floats on top of denser saltwater, according to the study. But as atoll islands are regularly swamped by salt water this freshwater will be contaminated making “human habitation difficult in most locations beginning between the to requiring the relocation of island inhabitants or significant financial investments in new infrastructure.” “The overwash events generally result in salty ocean water seeping into the ground and contaminating the freshwater aquifer. Rainfall later in the year is not enough to flush out the saltwater and refresh the island water supply before the next year storms arrive repeating the overwash event,” explained Stephen Gingerich, USGS hydrologist and co-author of the new report. The authors say although the study was focussed on Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands, the results will apply to people living in atolls around the world – including the Caroline Islands, Cook Islands , Gilbert Islands, Line Islands, Society Islands, Spratly Islands, Maldives, Seychelles, and north-western Hawaiian Islands. But the fate of people living on atolls will be just one part of the much wider climate migration crisis, said Dina Ionesco, head of migration, environment and climate change at the International Organisation for Migration. “Millions of people are going to be at risk from extreme heat, extreme water shortages and flooding as well as sea level rises... we are talking about something that is going to play a huge role in the years ahead in terms of forcing people to leave their homes.”",513,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/25/climate-change-to-drive-migration-from-island-homes-sooner-than-thought
58,"A world registry of invasive species has been launched amid concerns that governments are not doing enough to tackle the rising threat of globalisation to biodiversity. The new catalogue – unveiled in the journal Scientific Data on Tuesday – is expected to become a pillar of international efforts to fight extinction alongside the “red list” of endangered species . From yellow crazy ants on Christmas Island to little fire worms in the Galapagos, the deliberate or accidental introduction of non-native species is the biggest driver of biodiversity loss on islands and world heritage sites, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It can also cause huge economic and health impacts, as has been the case with the arrival in Europe of tropical mosquitos , which are vectors for malaria, or the spread of Latin American water hyacinths in Africa, which started off as cheap ornamental plants but now cause billions of dollars of losses because they clog up rivers, block ships, prevent fishing and create breeding grounds for mosquitos. The Global Registry of Introduced and Invasive Species catalogues these and thousands of other cases in a key step towards identifying and tackling the biggest risks. Based on an international collaboration by hundreds of scientists over eight years, the registry is seen as a tool – like the red list – that will allow countries to set up early warning and rapid response systems to prevent “door-knocking” species from entering in destructively large numbers. This week data release, which covers countries, reveals that of the identified invasive species have a negative impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. Information for the remaining nations will be available by the middle of the year. Alien species invasions and global warming a 'deadly duo', warn scientists “This is a milestone,” said Piero Genovesi, the chair of the Rome-based Invasive Species Special Group, which led the compilation of the registry. “With this paper we want to show the rigour of our approach because this information will affect trade relations and other government policies.” He said biological invasions are increasing in all regions and taxonomic groups and are likely to accelerate as a result of climate change, which is altering the ranges of habitats.",369,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/new-global-registry-of-invasive-species-is-milestone-in-protecting-biodiversity
59,"The abundance of flying insects has plunged by three-quarters over the past years, according to a new study that has shocked scientists. Insects are an integral part of life on Earth as both pollinators and prey for other wildlife and it was known that some species such as butterflies were declining. But the newly revealed scale of the losses to all insects has prompted warnings that the world is “on course for ecological Armageddon”, with profound impacts on human society. Share your pictures of insects around the world The new data was gathered in nature reserves across Germany but has implications for all landscapes dominated by agriculture, the researchers said. The cause of the huge decline is as yet unclear, although the destruction of wild areas and widespread use of pesticides are the most likely factors and climate change may play a role. The scientists were able to rule out weather and changes to landscape in the reserves as causes, but data on pesticide levels has not been collected. “The fact that the number of flying insects is decreasing at such a high rate in such a large area is an alarming discovery,” said Hans de Kroon, at Radboud University in the Netherlands and who led the new research. “Insects make up about two-thirds of all life on Earth [but] there has been some kind of horrific decline,” said Prof Dave Goulson of Sussex University, UK, and part of the team behind the new study. “We appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse.” The research, published in the journal Plos One , is based on the work of dozens of amateur entomologists across Germany who began using strictly standardised ways of collecting insects in Special tents called malaise traps were used to capture more than samples of all flying insects at different nature reserves. When the total weight of the insects in each sample was measured a startling decline was revealed. The annual average fell by over the year period, but the fall was even higher – – in summer, when insect numbers reach their peak. Previous reports of insect declines have been limited to particular insects, such European grassland butterflies , which have fallen by in recent decades. But the new research captured all flying insects, including wasps and flies which are rarely studied, making it a much stronger indicator of decline. The fact that the samples were taken in protected areas makes the findings even more worrying, said Caspar Hallmann at Radboud University, also part of the research team: “All these areas are protected and most of them are well-managed nature reserves. Yet, this dramatic decline has occurred.” The amateur entomologists also collected detailed weather measurements and recorded changes to the landscape or plant species in the reserves, but this could not explain the loss of the insects. “The weather might explain many of the fluctuations within the season and between the years, but it doesn’t explain the rapid downward trend,” said Martin Sorg from the Krefeld Entomological Society in Germany, who led the amateur entomologists. Goulson said a likely explanation could be that the flying insects perish when they leave the nature reserves. “Farmland has very little to offer for any wild creature,” he said. “But exactly what is causing their death is open to debate. It could be simply that there is no food for them or it could be, more specifically, exposure to chemical pesticides, or a combination of the two.” In September, a chief scientific adviser to the UK government warned that regulators around the world have falsely assumed that it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes and that the “effects of dosing whole landscapes with chemicals have been largely ignored”. The scientists said further work is urgently needed to corroborate the new findings in other regions and to explore the issue in more detail. While most insects do fly, it may be that those that don’t, leave nature reserves less often and are faring better. It is also possible that smaller and larger insects are affected differently, and the German samples have all been preserved and will be further analysed. In the meantime, said De Kroon: “We need to do less of the things that we know have a negative impact, such as the use of pesticides and the disappearance of farmland borders full of flowers.” Lynn Dicks at the University of East Anglia, UK, and not involved in the new research said the work was convincing. “It provides important new evidence for an alarming decline that many entomologists have suspected is occurring for some time.” “If total flying insect biomass is genuinely declining at this rate – about per year – it is extremely concerning,” she said. “Flying insects have really important ecological functions, for which their numbers matter a lot. They pollinate flowers: flies, moths and butterflies are as important as bees for many flowering plants, including some crops. They provide food for many animals – birds, bats, some mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians. Flies, beetles and wasps are also predators and decomposers, controlling pests and cleaning up the place generally.” Climate change could wipe out a third of parasite species, study finds Another way of sampling insects – car windscreens – has often been anecdotally used to suggest a major decline, with people remembering many more bugs squashed on their windscreens in the past. “I think that is real,” said Goulson. “I drove right across France and back this summer – just when you’d expect your windscreen to be splattered all over – and I literally never had to stop to clean the windscreen.”",964,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers

61,"Honey from across the world is contaminated with potent pesticides known to harm bees, new research shows, clearly revealing the global exposure of vital pollinators for the first time. Almost samples of honey were analysed for neonicotinoid insecticides and contained the chemicals, with most contaminated with multiple types. Bees range over many kilometres to collect nectar and pollen, making the honey they produce an excellent indicator of the pesticide pollution across their local landscape. Bees and other pollinators are vital to three-quarters of the world food crops but have been in serious decline in recent decades. The destruction of wild habitats, disease and widespread pesticide use are all important factors. Scientists responding to the new work say a crackdown on the industrial-scale use of the nerve agents is urgently needed. Assumed safety of pesticide use is false, says top government scientist The new analysis joins a growing number of highly critical reports on pesticides, including research showing most farmers could slash their pesticide use without losses , a UN report that denounced the “myth” that pesticides are necessary to feed the world, and a UK chief government scientist stating that the assumption by regulators it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes is false . The honey analyses, published in the journal Science , began as a citizen science project when researchers at the Botanical Garden of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, asked people to donate honey collected from around the world between and They received hundreds of samples and analysed of known local origin for the five main types of neonicotinoid. Contamination rates were highest in North America with of samples containing one or more neonicotinoid, followed by Asia and Europe It was lowest in South America at Almost half the samples contained a cocktail of the insecticides. “The striking finding is that of our samples had measurable quantities,” said Prof Edward Mitchell at the University of Neuchâtel. “That was surprising to us, since our coverage included many remote areas, including oceanic islands.” Furthermore, Mitchell said: “If you look at the minimum concentration for which a significant negative impact on bees has been found, then of our samples exceed this level.” The researchers said these impacts include damage to learning, behaviour and colony success. “The concentrations are often very low, but we are talking about pesticides that are extremely toxic: something like to times more toxic than DDT [dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane],” he said. In June, the largest-ever field trial showed that neonicotinoids damage the survival of honeybee colonies , as well as harming wild bees, and suggested a toxic “cocktail effect” from multiple pesticides. All but two of the samples had total contamination levels below the “maximum residue level” (MRL) allowed for human consumption under EU laws. But Mitchell said there was little published research on the effect of neonicotinoids on vertebrates, though there were some indications of harm. “You can wonder if the MRLs are really good enough – I think this is an open question, ”Mitchell said. Prof Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex, UK, and not involved in the new work, said: “Entire landscapes all over the world are now permeated with highly potent neurotoxins, undoubtedly contributing to the global collapse of biodiversity. It is hard not to feel a sense of deja vu: Rachel Carson was saying the same things more than years ago , but we seem not to have learned any lessons. It is high time that we developed a global regulatory system for pesticides, to prevent such catastrophes being repeated over and over again.” Christopher Connolly at the University of Dundee, UK, said: “The findings are alarming. It is time that these chemicals are heavily restricted for use. In this way, their impact on the environment can be limited and their efficacy against pests preserved for when there is no other alternative option.” Free school fruit contains multiple pesticides, UK report shows Jonathan Storkey at Rothamsted Research in the UK said the situation has arisen as much through the overuse of neonicotinoids as through their chemical properties, which may be more benign overall than older alternatives. “Rather than seeking an outright ban, research should focus on developing strategies for limiting their use,” he said. In a global assessment of neonicotinoids concluded that their widespread use was putting the global food production system at risk . An updated assessment, to be published in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research, found even stronger evidence of the insecticides’ harm: “The consequences are far reaching and cannot be ignored any longer.” Jean-Marc Bonmatin, at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Orléans, France, and one of the assessment team, said: “The use of these pesticides runs contrary to environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. It provides no real benefit to farmers, decreases soil quality, hurts biodiversity and contaminates water, air and food. There is no longer any reason to continue down this path of destruction.” Three neonicotinoids were banned from use on flowering crops in the EEU in The European commission has drafted new regulations that would ban these pesticides from all fields and these look likely to be passed in the coming months. “The global neonicotinoid contamination in honey is another reminder that wildlife is threatened by these chemicals around the world, and there is growing momentum in support of a new global solution to ensure that high standards of protection for the environment and people are applied everywhere,” said Matt Shardlow at Buglife UK.",909,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/honey-tests-reveal-global-contamination-by-bee-harming-pesticides

63,"Summer washout failed to dampen the prospects for the red admiral , one of the UK most popular butterflies, whose numbers rose by compared with last year, according to the annual Big Butterfly Count . Other butterfly species were less fortunate, however, with declines seen across the three common species of white butterflies. The green-veined white and both the large white and small white were down more than a third on last year, reflecting difficult weather conditions. The red admiral is one of the best recognised butterflies in Britain thanks to its distinctive black, orange and white markings. More than were counted in this year census carried out by the Butterfly Conservation charity between July and August. The large showing came on the back of a bumper year last year, and a mild winter and spring that helped some of the species stay in the UK – a new development in recent years, possibly assisted by a warming climate, for what used to be a summer visitor from southern Europe. Urban butterfly declines compared to drop in countryside The red admiral was not the most numerous butterfly in the count. The gatekeeper , also known as the hedge brown, with orange and brown wings and prominent black spots, was seen more than times, up nearly a quarter on last year. This year wet summer, the wettest on record (though temperatures were above average), spelled poor conditions for butterflies, which thrive in warmer and sunnier summers. Last year was also a bad year for butterflies and moths , so improvements this year are relative in many cases. It was a bumper year for the count itself as a record people took part in the three-week census which is the world biggest survey of butterfly numbers. More than butterflies were recorded, but the record number of surveyors hides a more concerning picture: each participant saw on average only about butterflies, the lowest number per person since the count began in Richard Fox, head of recording at Butterfly Conservation , said: “It hasn’t been a vintage summer for butterflies, but there have been some real positives. The highlight has been the huge number of people that have got involved, spent time enjoying and counting our native butterflies and moths, and done something useful and important in the face of so much wildlife decline.” The other most numerous butterflies spotted by volunteers were the meadow brown, whose numbers were third highest, the peacock with nearly examples, the common blue with nearly and the speckled wood butterfly at more than Despite the good news for the red admiral, butterflies in the UK are under threat , both from a changing climate, with the last years showing a pattern of damper summers, and from human factors. Butterflies are losing their habitat as a result of intensive farming, pesticides, urbanisation and populations becoming cut off, and the added pressure of weather changes is having an impact on their breeding and food sources. Butterflies and moths are also valuable to farmers and gardeners as pollinators, though on a smaller scale than bees.",514,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/25/red-admiral-thrives-in-butterfly-count-while-whites-show-decline
64,"lready a peacock butterfly has selected our curtains for winter quarters, but it is early for this fly to be going into hibernation, and many are still on the wing, settling on the scabious and ragworts in the lanes or the flowers in our gardens. Perhaps the yellowing foliage of the sycamore and showers of curled, crisp beech leaves already down had given it a warning; it had a duty to fulfil: a long death-like slumber and a short flight next spring to find the young nettles and lay its eggs, thus linking up the years. It is many years since peacocks and red admirals were so abundant as they are now; everywhere people are struck by the numbers, not only locally nor even in other parts of England. A friend in France writes:– “The crops here are barbed wire, thistles, and nettles; I don’t know what the first produces, but the two last have brought out great lots of painted ladies, red admirals, peacocks, and a positive swarm of small tortoiseshells.” The weeds of the war-scarred, untilled land have produced one beautiful crop.

I hear of its occurrence recently at Sale, and yesterday the corpse of one in a toffee-box reached me by post.

65,"Drowning wasps in beer in the name of science may seem a socially acceptable way to exterminate a seasonal pest. But a citizen science survey “harnessing the public dislike of wasps” has been criticised for its “hateful language” and for unnecessarily killing rare insects. The Big Wasp Survey is encouraging volunteers to build homemade bottle traps before posting the dead wasps to entomologists to produce a clearer picture of the much-maligned insect decline. But the project, which is supported by the Royal Entomological Society , has been stung by criticism from other conservationists. “It hard to form good intentions with hateful language,” said Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife , of the Big Wasp Survey. “We’re uncomfortable with their underlying message – that it fine to kill wasps if we don’t like them.” According to Shardlow, the survey “indiscriminate” traps will kill other potentially rare insects and beetles and “the ends do not justify the means” in terms of the data this survey will produce. Shardlow said its citizen science data will not be as valuable as that acquired by a new insect survey established by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as part of its national pollinator monitoring programme – supported by both Buglife and the National Farmers’ Union. Why climate change is good news for wasps This survey will also kill insects but will do so “in a very careful way”, according to Shardlow, as traps at representative sample sites across the country ensure the minimum number of insects are killed. In contrast, he said, the Big Wasp Survey data will predominantly come from people gardens and will not provide such useful scientific data. Shardlow also said the survey could not guarantee that only old worker wasps are killed, and queens – the source of next year colonies – could potentially be trapped, hitting wasp populations. But the scientists behind the Big Wasp Survey, Dr Seirian Sumner of University College London, and Prof Adam Hart of the University of Gloucestershire , have defended the project and said its design minimises the likelihood of queens or other insects being killed. “We’ve thought very carefully about this. We are experts in wasp ecology and life history, unlike Buglife,” said Sumner. “These traps are the standard method to monitor wasp populations around the world. Sometimes you get flies in them, sometimes you get the accidental falling of an insect in them but there no way a beetle or bee would be attracted to them.” According to Sumner, the survey is running from August to September to minimise the risk of catching new queens and reproductive males which both emerge later in September. At most, the number of wasps collected – – will be less than reside in a single wasp colony. Buglife has not called for the survey to be cancelled but Shardlow said: “We wished the researchers had investigated first how they could assist and support the already existing national monitoring scheme.” Sumner said the Big Wasp Survey was “much more fine-scaled” than Defra national monitoring plan, which will catch all kinds of insects. “Our aims are to quantify wasp species abundance, distribution and diversity across the UK which we currently don’t have anything other than very patchy data for,” she said. She said the data gathered would have numerous other scientific uses and could reveal urban-rural wasp distribution and whether regional differences in wasp colour can be attributed to environmental contamination. Where the warring entomologists agree is on the importance of the different species of wasp. “I’m probably the biggest wasp-lover in the world, I’m the last person to want to instil hatred of wasps,” said Sumner. “This is about raising public awareness of these much-maligned insects. They are the gangsters of the natural world, the top predators without which we would be inundated with aphids. They pollinate, they disperse seeds. They are on a par with bees with the ecosystem services they provide.” Shardlow added: “Wasp populations are tiny compared to what they were in the and We should cherish what we’ve got left. They are an important indicator of the health of our environment. Getting to grips with their numbers is very important.”",698,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/23/conservationists-slam-hateful-survey-promoting-wasp-killing
66,"n a sloping meadow near the centre of Oslo, red-tailed bumblebees gather pollen from hairy violets, spiders spin webs between maiden tears while hoverflies buzz between yellow daisies and white yarrow. Such a bucolic scene might normally be associated more with a rural past than an urban future, but it is part of a thoroughly modern attempt to reverse the decline of bee populations and put biodiversity at the heart of city planning in Norway capital. Since last year, Oslo municipal government has established more than meadows, botanists run workshops on scything and planting, and garden owners are replacing their trimmed lawns and exotic plants with grasses and wildflowers to attract pollinators. It is linked to a national strategy that includes measures to encourage private garden owners to cultivate wildflowers along an urban insect corridor. An NGO – Bybi – is encouraging more people to keep hives. The enthusiasm has surprised some of the campaign most ardent proponents. “We had more than people come out in the rain for a recent tour,” said Kristina Bjureke, a botanist at the natural history museum who wrote part of the plant management plan for Oslo meadows. “It must have looked a little crazy to see all those people staring at a patch of grass.” Although biodiversity is usually associated with tropical forests, this northern municipality – which was recently named Europe Green Capital for – claims to be the most species-rich capital in Europe thanks to its fjord, forests and parks, home to varieties of flora and fauna. Until recently, however, the city better known green credentials – and efforts to offset the uncomfortable fact that its main source of revenue is oil – have been impressive goals to halve carbon emissions by recycle waste and promote the use of clean transport with tax credits, free charging, free tolls and use of bus lanes. But biodiversity has moved up the political agenda since the small Green party became kingmaker in the city governing coalition two years ago. The Greens championed the hay meadows to protect some of Oslo most vulnerable species at a time when the city human population was increasing more rapidly than that of almost any other European capital. “We know that we need to protect and restore biodiversity even as we build new homes. In a city that is growing fast, it also important to make it nice to live. That means good quality green areas,” said vice-mayor Lan Marie Nguyen Berg from the Green party. “We’d like to transfer the knowledge that we have to other cities.” For centuries, meadows were used here and in many other countries to grow winter fodder for cattle on nutrient-poor land that was unsuitable for continuous large-scale grazing. The annual cycle of cutting and growing nurtured an abundance of insects, plants, fungi, birds, small mammals and wild grazers such as deer on these sunny grasslands. But they have declined in recent decades due to the expansion of industrial farming and land use for buildings. Botanists say there are almost no meadows left in nearby Denmark. Britain has also witnessed a decline . With of Oslo red-listed species depending on meadows, the government decided to recreate the habitat in a dozen pilot plots. This number is set to grow. The Norwegian council for biodiversity (Sabima) has lobbied the government to provide a budget for farmers to maintain meadows and other ecologically important areas. There are now of these biodiversity hotspots. Over the next decade, they aim for “Oslo can be considered a model because we know what there and how to protect it,” biologist and campaigner Anna Blix said during a rainy walk through one of the latest additions in Tøyen Park. “We don’t have huge endangered mammals in meadows, but there are many important plants and insects that are at risk.” As well as the economic benefits that come from pollinators, she said a strong natural habitat was likely to be more resilient to storms and rising temperatures. “It is increasingly recognised that biodiversity is crucial for action against climate change.” The cost is low because some of the meadow grasses are “weeds” that would grow by themselves on untended land. But there is also a technical side of the project that involves the selection of appropriately poor soil and the cultivation in nurseries of the right species to maximise ecological richness so that bees and other pollinators can thrive for much of the year. Bjureke said the campaign made economic sense – and not just because of the bees. She cited the case of mountain arnica, which is used in the production of anti-inflammatory creams. This ground-hugging yellow daisy depends on the regular scything of longer grass once a year so it can get sufficient light. But with this custom in decline over recent decades, the once common flower is now on the nation red list for endangered species, leaving the cream business dominated by German pharmaceutical companies that buy daisies from Romania. Thanks to the improved collaboration between city hall, scientists and NGOs, she hopes Oslo can arrest the decline. “More and more people are asking how they can get involved and they are getting younger and younger. For me, the most positive trend is that more students are now interested in field biology than lab studies of DNA.” Amateur biologists are now helping scientists with a nationwide biodiversity census that aims not just to count and locate species, but to highlight their value. There is a long way to go. Insect corridors help to raise awareness in cities but they cannot solve the bigger problems in the countryside caused by pesticides and industrial farming. Those who want to protect Oslo ecological wealth know it is more important to prevent development encroaching on the forest and to scale down the nation dependence on fossil fuels. Compared to the areas of robot-mowed grass in the city parks, the urban meadows are tiny but their value is not just a matter of size or money, according to Bjureke. “When I go to the meadows, I feel complete. I see the activity and complexity of nature, the composition of small and big species. It the best way to relieve stress. Much better than meditation or medication.”",1042,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/26/oslo-meadows-biodiversity-bees-urban-gardeners
67,"The EU has dropped plans to force toaster-makers to improve the energy efficiency of their products over fears of the political costs of being seen to be intruding in people daily lives, it has emerged. But while a new EU plan to cut emissions controversially omits several appliances, the manufacturers of electric kettles, refrigerators and hand driers will have to make their future products consume less energy. Solar panels and building automation systems are among the six product ranges set to benefit from the Ecodesign package, which should help Europe meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement. But hairdryers, hot drinks vending machines and toasters – the subject of a tabloid campaign during the Brexit referendum – will be excluded, the commission first vice-president, Frans Timmermans, told a Brussels press conference. “We want to put the products on the list that have the highest energy yield,” he said. “That is why kettles are on the list, because they are very high in terms of energy yields, and toasters are not on the list.” An internal EU “lines to take” document from last month, seen by the Guardian, shows that fears of hostile press coverage were central to the proposal genesis. The cabinet-level document notes that the EU has been “regularly accused of regulatory over-reach and intrusiveness in people daily lives and behavioural choices, when banning products from the market and limiting consumer choice. “The strong negative publicity about intrusiveness raises the question whether the estimated but hardly evaluated economic benefits are worth the political costs for the EU and the commission in particular.” The commission broke with a tradition of announcing the package after extensive studies and consultation due to an initiative by Jean-Claude Juncker to make all commissioners take “political ownership” of it. A separate internal EU note seen by the Guardian shows that the six-product list was personally chosen by Juncker for “explicit validation” by other commissioners. In the document, lines are drawn through products such as toasters, hairdryers and signage displays, which “Juncker recommends … above all not to be part of a possible package,” the document says. After an legislative delay, green groups said they were uncomfortable about the EU announcement. “The decision to remove five domestic and industrial products from the Ecodesign list will cost consumers annually from onwards,” warned Chloé Fayole, a spokeswoman for the Coolproducts campaign. “We are also concerned about the fate of three IT products, including smartphones, which are not part of the list.” Stéphane Arditi of the European Environmental Bureau said that smartphones were a “glaring absence” in the package, throwing doubt on how the EU would cut their emissions from manufacture, use and disposal, which are considerable. The Ecodesign framework brings in an estimated in extra revenue for industry, creating as many as jobs and saving Europe householders an estimated in energy bills each year, according to the EU. Ecodesign is also responsible for half of the EU energy savings expected by – and a quarter of its emissions cuts. But energy efficiency can be a hard sell in consumer societies, and the EU ecodesign plans have spurred newspapers such as the Daily Express to decry them as a threat to “the British way of life”. Speaking to journalists in Brussels, Timmermans acknowledged that the tabloids had been “very influential” in drawing out the EU ecodesign policy-making process. “We were very sensitive to what we’ve seen the media whipping up in the last couple of years,” he said. “But after careful analysis you have to make a choice – if you go along with this rhetoric or let the evidence speak for itself and that what we did.” The Ecodesign package should still save as much primary energy as Sweden consumes annually, although its predecessors saved as much energy as was generated by Italy.",636,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/08/eu-drops-plans-to-make-toasters-more-energy-efficient-over-intrusion-fears
68,"he bullet that pierced the shoulder of Ugandan ranger Samuel Loware had already taken one life and could easily have added his. The shell was fired by a Sudanese poacher trying to flee back over the border with contraband meat from the Kidepo Valley national park. Loware had been tracking the fugitive - one of a band of heavily armed raiders - from the early morning with the help of a local villager. As the two pursuers approached a gully, the poacher opened fire from behind a tree trunk that had been pushed down by an elephant. One shot passed through the chest of the villager into the body of the ranger, who was returning fire. The poacher escaped, leaving the villager dead and Loware with a bullet lodged under his skin. The bone was not fractured but the wound could have been fatal. By the time the ranger reached the nearest clinic, the bullet had moved so far from the entry point that nurses were unable to find it. The sergeant had to be driven several hours further to a hospital in Kitgum , where X-rays revealed the location – four inches down his back – allowing a surgeon to cut it out before it could claim a second life. This episode on February was the latest in a series of deadly clashes between Ugandan rangers – who are dedicated to protect elephants, giraffes, zebras and buffalos – and heavily armed guerrilla-turned poachers who are desperate for food and money after deserting from the Sudanese People Liberation army. Five months on, Loware is sitting at a broken plastic table in an empty dining room in Apoca, the rangers camp in the centre of the vast expanse of savanna that makes up the Kidepo Valley national park . His wounds have healed, but he knows the risks have not gone away. The person who shot him is still at large. Countless other desperate Sudanese are taking their and Kalashnikovs on raids across the border, where they terrorise villagers, hunt antelopes, bucks, zebra, buffalos and other animals for meat, or kill elephants and ostriches on behalf of Chinese ivory and bone-marrow smugglers. His family have begged him to return home because they are worried about his safety but he tells them that being a ranger is the best way he can provide for his seven children, as well as contributing to the local economy and the world. “They should be happy that I survived,” he says. Loware profession is the most perilous form of environmental defence in the world. Close to a hundred rangers have been killed every year since according to Thin Green Line , an NGO that lobbies for greater protection for nature frontline protectors. In the past year, most of the deaths have been in east and central Africa. For Loware, the worst previous period was when he was caught up in two deadly operations. In the first, two Ugandan self-defence force soldiers were killed in a joint operation with rangers against buffalo poachers armed with On another mission, he saw his commander killed in a gun battle with Sudanese poachers near the Kidepo river. “That was a terrible time,” he recalls. “I was traumatised. I thought of quitting.” This is a familiar refrain among rangers, who often suffer from mental as well as physical strains. Their burden is huge. As in the Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Rwanda and Kenya, rangers alone cannot save Africa wildlife, but they do slow the slaughter. Inside the park, many villagers have been persuaded to give up illegal arms. There have been numerous confiscations of skins and ivory. Many poachers have been arrested or killed. But the porous border with Sudan remains a problem. The key, Loware believes, is better frontier management and greater education for young Sudanese. Many poachers are teenagers who have spent their lives in war zones rather than schools. They have guns but no concept of conservation. “In the north these guys have no relationship with animals. They say, we are keeping these animals for what?” he explains. By contrast, Loware says he was raised to believe in wildlife protection as a necessity and an opportunity. Conservation is often portrayed as a foreign concept, but he says indigenous people in his region practiced sustainable culling of wild animals long before the creation of the Kidepo national park in During British rule, his uncle asked for the support of police to punish those who failed to follow the rules. This led to the establishment of “game guards”, the precursors of today rangers. That same uncle also used to proselytise in the village, telling his family and neighbours that if they did not care for giraffes, elephants and other animals, then their children might only know them from books. Several family members took up the cause. Loware joined the Uganda Wildlife Authority Rangers in The six months of training was gruelling. Of the who were recruited alongside him, he was one of only who graduated. Now a sergeant, his duties include ecological monitoring, fire management, radio operation and wildlife database updating. For him, fire prevention is the most important task, but it is usually only when there is a conflict with poachers that his increasingly militarised work makes the headlines. Despite high risks and low pay per month), he plans to continue and another generation of his family could follow him into the job. He tells his seven children about his work and the importance of conservation to Uganda and the world. He says the wildlife he protects brings academics and tourists, whose funds help to build schools and clinics. There are also jobs for researchers and hotel workers. The Ugandan ranger forces is set to add another to its ranks this month. The perils remain. Overall Loware says the situation is no better than when he started. But he no longer thinks of quitting as he did after the death of his commander. “As of now I am comfortable because - as they say - if you run you will never run from death,” he says. “Even a man who sits at home and doesn’t work as a ranger can die in an accident or be killed by raiders. So from that time until now I decided that for the love of conservation, for the love of the rest of my colleagues and for the love of the country, let us work.”",1073,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/you-will-never-run-from-death-shot-by-poachers-in-uganda
69,"or years, Fatima Babu struggled to galvanise the citizens of Tuticorin in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu against the toxic threat posed by the Sterlite Copper smelter. Often working thanklessly and sometimes alone, she filed lawsuits, organised workshops and gave interviews to raise awareness. The English professor-turned-activist hoped that people would eventually rally to the cause, but never in her wildest dreams did she imagine how quickly opinion could change or how violently the authorities would respond. On May this year, a crowd of about took to the streets to oppose plans to double the size of the plant, which would have made it the second biggest copper smelter in the world. The numbers completely overwhelmed the police who responded first with tear gas, then live rounds. It was the world deadliest environmental protest so far this year, with people killed and dozens injured. The authorities say protesters pelted police with stones and burned vehicles. Babu says their response went far beyond reasonable force. “It wasn’t shooting to disperse a crowd. It wasn’t tear gas or rubber bullets. The shots weren’t fired above people heads or below the knees. They were fired directly into the crowd,” she says. “I think they wanted to suffocate the protests against St erlite and other projects. They wanted to teach us a lesson; if you raise your voice, this is what you get.” Babu had attempted moderation by holding talks with the local government. “We had no plans for violence. We knew women and children would be coming,” she said. “When we heard thousands of police were being mobilised we feared there would be baton charges so we advised women to wear something other than saris, which make it hard to run.” The authorities have launched an inquiry into the killings. Sterlite has distanced itself from the police actions and expressed regret about the deaths. The Tamil Nadu government has shut down the smelter. Despite campaigning against the plant since its foundation stone was laid in Babu is not in a mood to celebrate victory. The cost – in terms of human lives – was too high and past experience suggests the shutdown may be temporary. But she is relieved that, for now at least, there may be a reduction of health risks. In Pandarampatty, a village not far from the plant, residents report people have been diagnosed with cancer since Babu also says there have been more cases of respiratory diseases. Sterlite – a subsidiary of the Vedanta Resources conglomerate – has previously denied this, saying cancer rates are lower than the average in India and that its facilities have met all environmental guidelines. Sterlite were approached for comment by the Guardian but did not respond. But when electricity was cut following the shutdown, managers said the plant suffered a severe leak of sulphuric acid with serious environmental consequences. According to Sterlite website, the existing smelter has a capacity of tonnes of copper per year. In addition, it has a coal-power plant and facilities to produce tonnes per year of sulphuric acid and more than metric tonnes of phosphoric acid. In the wake of the shutdown, much of these chemicals have been shipped away. Babu hopes the closure will also ease the pressure on her. “I have been through tough times. The company has always singled me out as the enemy. That a dangerous position to be in.” She says her opponents have tried to malign her reputation, divide her family and use her Christian religion to turn believers of other faiths against her. “They brand us anti-social or anti-India, or they claim it because I am a Christian. But there are also Hindus and Muslims in this struggle. We are patriotic. We want to save the resources of our country,” she says. Now years old, she says she is too old to worry about risks to her life, but she is incensed by the smear campaign against her and other environmental campaigners. “Something in happening in the world. Activists are being branded as terrorists, but we are not against the country. We’re very patriotic. That why were are doing this. We don’t want our country sold out for profit,” she says. “This phenomenon of destroying people and the planet for profit is not just happening in India . It across the globe. We need to come together for future generations. We need to be strong and courageous and hold on to our values.”",743,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/we-had-no-plans-for-violence-indian-campaign-against-toxic-smelter-turned-deadly
70,"A warning voice on the telephone, a home intrusion, a punch in the face, a pistol barrel prodded against the ear. The intimidation of Maria do Socorro Silva has come in many forms since she began defending her Amazonian home against the world biggest alumina refinery and its local government backers. As a leader of forest dwellers – indigenous, quilombo and riverine communities – Socorro ought to be terrified. Her home is in Pará, the deadliest state for land activists in Brazil , the most murderous country in the world. Two associates and friends have been killed since December. But there is fury rather than fear in the eyes of the diminutive, powerful woman as she speaks of the industrial plant that threatens her quilombo, a community established in the forest by African slaves who broke their chains. “Will we fight this? Yes. Will more die? Yes!” she spits, her hands forming fists. “They kill the water, the air and the animals. They should be put in prison.” To be in the presence of Socorro is to face a storm. Animated and angry at the refinery company and the government, she also sheds tears over the plight of her community and environment. This - the people and the land - comes first. Only then does she speak of herself, quietly letting slip that she has just been diagnosed with cancer. Test results indicate high levels of lead contamination in her blood. For years, she has been fighting on multiple fronts: against the Norwegian-owned Hydro Alunorte refinery in Barcarena , against the Albras bauxite mine that supplies it, against powerful land-grabbing politicians, against investors, against first-world consumers who use tin cans, foil, non-stick pans, beer kegs and aeroplane parts without a thought about the environmental and social costs. For an outsider, it may seem strange at first that a descendent of African rebel slaves should be leading Amazonian forest people in this campaign. But for Socorro, the struggle is deeply personal, as well as historically symbolic. It is about land, race, inequality and justice. Her ancestors were among the million Africans brutally forced to work in homes and plantations in Brazil, the world biggest slave-owning nation and the last to abolish the practice. Some rebelled, many fled into remote regions like Barcarena to build their own free refuges, known as quilombos. Today, there are of these communities which are home to an estimated million residents (or quilombolas). Even after emancipation in the conditions for Afro-Brazilians remained grim. For more than a century, the most the quilombolas could hope for was to be ignored. But in recent years, they have campaigned for legal status, which entitled them to property rights and social benefits. When Socorro community was finally acknowledged by the government in she said it was among the most important moments in her life. “This is a recognition that I am not an invader, I am a quilombola,” she said at the time. Getting the land was one thing, keeping it another. In Congress, the powerful bancada ruralista (rural lobby) is pushing to overturn the rights of quilombolas and indigenous groups so more land can be taken by agribusiness and mining companies. This is the primary driver of violence in Pará, which has more quilombos than any other state. Barcarena is no longer isolated. The population has grown with the opening of road and river links, a bauxite mine and industrial zone. It takes only three hours to drive the here from Belém, a journey that once took days. Among the palm trees, quilombo vegetable patches and indigenous aldeia now have to jostle for space with factories and shops. Tension over space is growing. The expansion of the alumina refinery is at the heart of economic development plans promoted by local politicians. In the way, stands Socorro, her community and their allegations of land-grabbing, pollution and corruption. Almost a decade ago she began to denounce the refinery, then owned by Brazil Vale mining company. One of the tailings pools, she claimed, was built without permission on an environmentally protected area. “At first, we didn’t realise what was happening because the factory was small. But as it grew, we began to realise. First the fishermen, then the animals. Our plants have been destroyed,” she says. “I’ve been complaining since but nobody does anything because the mayor is involved. The government are bandits and murderers. They have no respect for us.” The authorities ignored her warnings, she said, because they were on the side of the company, and, besides, she was a quilombola - arguably the most overlooked group in Brazil. But she kept pressing the case. As president of the Association of Caboclos, Indigenas and Quilombolas da Amazônia (Cainquiama), which represents thousands of local forest-dwellers, she arranged protests and filed two lawsuits against Hydro Norte. She denounced the company to public prosecutors, the Pará state legislative assembly, and the media. “The Norwegians get rich at our expense. They don’t care about our poor and miserable people,” the matriarch lamented as family and friends looked on at her walled home. Her life is at risk. Last year, Earth defenders were murdered in Brazil, more than a fifth of the world total , according to Global Witness. The vast majority took place in the Amazon, where rich nature, poor policing and dire corruption breed a culture of strongest-takes-all. Pollution, illness, threats and murder: is this Amazon factory the link? Since December, two Cainquiama leaders have been murdered - Fernando Perreira on December and Paulo Sérgio Almeida Nascimento on March. Police have no leads on the killers. The group lawyers believe they are linked to local politicians who want to silence opposition to the industrial plant. So does Socorro. “Fernando died, Paulo Sergio died, but the truth is that it [the industrial plant] is slowly killing all of us. Every day we drink the water, every day we die a little bit. This is not just now, it has been happening for years. No one else has the courage to denounce it,” Socorro says. Norsk Hydro - the Norwegian company that owns of Hydro Alunorte and of Albras - is not implicated in the killings and it has condemned the use of intimidation tactics. The company says it operates in accordance with Brazilian criminal law and environmental regulations, and that its plant has not had a negative impact on the health of local residents. Socorro claims about pollution were strengthened on and February when heavy rains flooded the Hydro Alunorte site, leading to reports of contamination of surrounding waters. Researchers from the Evandro Chagas Institute, which is affiliated to the health ministry, discovered high levels of sulphate, chloride and lead in the nearby community of Bom Futuro. Levels of aluminium were more than times Brazil legal limit. When the Guardian visited several weeks later, the water was still an unhealthy milky white and residents complained of diarrhoea and stomach pains. A subsequent investigation by the authorities found a waste pipe that was not supposed to exist. Courts recognised that one of the waste ponds was built illegally and punished the company by ordering a production cut of The governor of Pará is demanding $ in damages. Hydro Alunorte has appealed. It says other studies show no contamination from the plant. But it also apologised and promised to provide free medical care and bottled water to more than local people. Socorro feels vindicated, but she is far from satisfied. She believes refinery executives, political leaders and local environmental officials should be punished. “Everyone knows what happened in Barcarena, but they turned a blind eye. They have to be arrested,” she says. Then, in case anyone might think intimidation might end her campaign, she adds a vow to fight on. “They do not like what we do.

71,"Who are land and environmental defenders? Land and environmental defenders are people who take peaceful action, either voluntarily or professionally, to protect the environment or land rights. They are often ordinary people who may well not define themselves as “defenders”. Some are indigenous or peasant leaders living in remote mountains or isolated forests, protecting their ancestral lands and traditional livelihoods from business projects such as mining, dams or luxury hotels. Others are park rangers tackling poaching or illegal logging. They could even be lawyers, journalists or NGO staff working to expose environmental abuse and land grabbing. How does Global Witness document killings of defenders? Global Witness uses online searches and its extensive network of local contacts to source evidence every time a land or environmental defender is reported as murdered, or as having been abducted by state forces. A number of criteria must be fulfilled for a case to be verified and entered into the Global Witness database. A credible online source of information is required with the victim name, details of how they were killed or abducted (including the date and location), and evidence that s/he was a land or environmental activist. In some cases, specialised local organisations are able to investigate and verify the case in-country, meaning that an online source is not necessary. Global Witness includes the friends, colleagues and family of defenders if either they appear to have been killed as a reprisal for the defender work, or because they were killed in an attack which also left the defender dead. While Global Witness endeavours to keep its database updated in real-time, verification of cases can be time-consuming, meaning that the names of some individuals are added weeks, or even months, after their death. Why does Global Witness say that its data is incomplete? There are a number of reasons why the information in Global Witness database is likely to be incomplete. Many killings go unreported, and very few are investigated by the authorities, which is part of the problem itself. Suppression of the media and restrictions on human rights in some countries reduces the number of organisations and outlets documenting killings. In high-conflict countries it can be difficult to verify that a killing was linked to somebody activism. Some countries are likely to be under-represented because principal searches are currently limited to English, Spanish, Portuguese and French. Global Witness network of local sources is also stronger in some regions than others. For full details of Global Witness methodology, visit globalwitness.org/defenders/methodology Global Witness would not be able to keep its database updated without the close collaboration of local NGOs working tirelessly to document attacks on land and environmental defenders.

72,"hen the soldiers opened fire on Datal Bonglangon village , there was first confusion, then terror, then grief. But Marivic Danyan – one of the younger, quieter members of the community – decided to be strong. Reluctantly, heartbreakingly strong. The young T’boli woman had been preparing lunch when her remote, indigenous community on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao was peppered with gunfire. One bullet ripped into the wooden wall beside her. Another pierced the corrugated tin roof. Ignoring her pleas to take cover, her father – Victor, the village chief – rushed out with a handmade rifle and bow and arrows. He staggered back soon after, shot and bleeding. Danyan held his hand as he breathed his last. For the next hours, she and her two young daughters cowered inside the family home along with a handful of survivors, wondering what had happened to other menfolk who had been working in the cornfields. It was not until the next morning that they ventured out and saw the carnage. In total, eight people were killed by the Philippine army Infantry Battalion on December Half of them were Danyan close family. Along with her father, she lost her husband, Pato Celardo, and two brothers, Victor Junior and Artemio. “That when I decided to be strong so I could tend to the bodies,” she recalls with evident pain. “I had to put part of my husband brains back inside his skull so he was fit for burial. I tried to change the clothes of my dead brothers, but their wounds were too bad.” She also inherited the ceremonial dagger of the tribal chief, or datu , from her father, along with the campaign he had fought for almost three decades against a coffee plantation on community land. Danyan believes it was her father determination to regain territory from the plantation, Silvicultural Industries, that led to the killings. Short, thin and soft-spoken, Danyan appears far younger than her years, but her eyes radiate intelligence and a fierce determination. Even before the attack, she was respected as the first member of the community to graduate from high school. In its wake, she has become the head of her family, a candidate to become the first female chief of the village and a leader in the community efforts to regain its land and protect its environment. The Philippine government says the villagers were caught in a crossfire between the military and the New People Army (NPA) , one of many rebel groups that have turned Mindanao into one of the deadliest conflict zones in east Asia. A bumpy four-hour drive to the massacre site reveals how a simmering land dispute exploded into violence – an all-too-common occurrence under the shoot-first-ask-questions-later presidency of Rodrigo Duterte . Last year, activists were murdered in the Philippines , making it by far the deadliest country in Asia for environmental defenders. Datal Bonglangon is a cluster of one-storey wooden homes, cornfields and a small dirt square where local children play basketball next to a water buffalo pen. It would be bucolic if not for its neighbour. Plantation security guards look down from a watchtower amid hillsides of stubby, dark-green arabica coffee bushes. Danyan was a year old when an earlier leaseholder – a logging company – arrived with bulldozers and chainsaws in Older villagers say they were ordered to evacuate by armed thugs. Some of their homes were burned, destroying the resting places of their ancestors. (In those days T’bolis interred the bodies of their loved ones inside tree trunks that they would use as benches.) Most of the nearby forest – on which the community depended for fruit and medicine – was cut down. The birds, wild boar and monkeys disappeared along with the trees. Since then, the young are no longer taught how to use bows and arrows, because there is nothing left to hunt. After the land was cleared, hectares were acquired for years by Silvicultural Industries . Little is known about this company, but villagers and environmentalists believe it is part of the vast agribusiness, mining and construction conglomerate built by David M Consunji, a former minister during the Marcos dictatorship. Villagers say the plantation – also known as Dawang Coffee – left them struggling for survival. “We have very little land left. Not enough to grow the food we need. People go hungry,” says Dande Dinyan, the regional chieftain of Tamasco, the umbrella group campaigning for T’boli, Ubo and Manobo rights. These indigenous peoples once inhabited the fertile plains. Centuries of colonisation pushed them into the hills near Lake Sebu. In recent decades they have been squeezed further with the arrival of extractive industries. I urge people not to buy coffee from this region. It has caused us so much suffering Marivic Danyan, T'Boli community “This is their last frontier. If they lose this land, where else do they have to go?” says Sister Susan Bolanio, executive director of Oblates of Notre Dame-run Hesed Foundation, who has worked with the community for decades. Danyan father dedicated his life to recovering the territory. For years he waited for the expiry of the plantation lease, which was up in December Shortly before then, however, the government declared an extension of this lease and a bundle of others linked to Consunji. This was the final straw for the chief, who hacked down a area of coffee trees and replanted the land with corn. With her husband and brothers, he then marched into the camp of the plantation guards and ordered them to leave. Arrest warrants were issued for Victor and several other members of the community. They say they received death threats from fellow T’boli tribesmen who were employed by the company? Then the army became involved. NPA insurgents praised the villagers’ resistance against what they called the “environmentally destructive enterprise” of Consunji. With tensions rising, mediators linked to the Catholic church arranged talks between Victor and the government on December. Hours before they were due to go ahead, soldiers opened fire. Army commanders may genuinely have believed they were attacking a guerrilla base. The government claims two soldiers were killed along with an NPA leader, and that four guns were later found at the site. But human rights groups, indigenous campaigners, independent forensic experts and legal activists say the chief was a respected and peaceful campaigner who was deliberately silenced to end his protests. Danyan is convinced her father was killed because he stood up against a powerful company, and tried to grow corn for a hungry local community instead of coffee for export. “I want his protest to be remembered,” she said. “I urge people not to buy coffee from this region. It has caused us so much suffering.” Her supporters have called for an independent investigation into both the killings and the dubious extension of the plantation lease. The campaign goes on. “I don’t have a choice,” Danyan says. “Blood has been spilled and we are ready to give our lives. I won’t use violence. I will use the law, but I will continue to fight.”",1181,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/philippines-lives-land-lost-coffee-empire-militarised-politics
73,"irhan Erkutlu and Tuğba Günal moved into the forests of Antalya to get away from it all. They wanted a natural, peaceful life free of capitalism, consumer culture, social media, the internet, even electricity. Fate had other plans. Fourteen years on, the two artists are now figureheads of a campaign to protect rivers and trees from a cascade of hydropower plants. Their tweets and Facebook posts attract hundreds of thousands of followers. They use drones to expose wrongdoing. And they have overcome threats, warning shots and a hostile political culture to lobby successfully for the creation of a new protected area. “We have become guardians here without intending to,” says Erkutlu. “But now we see how many others are doing this around the world. It has opened our minds. Maybe our problems are small compared to the Amazon and elsewhere. But it is the same threats, the same courts.” The Turkish couple high-tech activism is accidental. The artists have known each other from their teens. They left wealthy neighbourhoods of Istanbul in and built a home in the Alakir Valley without electricity, telephones or internet. The goal was to explore the possibilities of an alternative lifestyle; to escape rather than confront consumer culture. But it caught up with them five years later when they heard the sound of bulldozers and chainsaws near their woodland home. The Kürce HES power company were clearing land alongside the Alakır river so they could begin construction of a cascade of six hydroelectric dams. “We decided to do everything we can to stop them,” says Erkutlu. “We saw birds raise chicks here. Squirrels and foxes too. After a while, they become like family. When someone comes to your home and starts to kill them, it a normal reflex to try to stop them.” They changed tack. Abandoning a policy of isolation and total self-sufficiency, they asked friends for donations to help pay for a legal challenge against the project, then painted pictures, released albums and performed street art to raise awareness and funds. Most effectively, they have taken to social media to mobilise public opinion, posting photos of the destruction. A backlash followed. Some in the local community turned against them for opposing a company that had brought jobs and tax revenue. Their visitors were threatened. Lawsuits were filed. Police called them in repeatedly for questioning. Shots were fired outside their home. The political climate in Turkey was also becoming more hostile to environmental activism. In a small demonstration to save trees in Istanbul Gezi Park from a shopping mall project morphed into a nationwide wave of anti-government protests that brought hundreds of thousands of people into Taksim Square. After that, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said opponents of development projects were traitors. Underscoring the risks was the high-profile murder in Antalya last year of two anti-quarry campaigners – Aysin and Ali Büyüknohutçu – who were shot in their homes on May soon after winning a landmark court case against a marble company. The alleged killer said he was paid to carry out the hit by the company boss, but was found dead in prison before he could tell a judge. Guards said it was suicide. The case was closed. “That was a shock,” said Erkutlu. “It was a message to environmental defenders that you can be killed and nobody will be punished.” Their alternative lifestyle drew media attention to development issues that otherwise get little coverage in Turkey, which has the world worst record for arresting journalists. “Until then, there was little journalism about the environment,” said Günal. “We invited some journalists and said they could write about our lives as long as was about the environment. That was our deal,” she said. “It a thin line. We don’t want to be killed … and we don’t want to be arrested by the government, but we want to defend the environment.” The couple say the company has bought much of the land around their plot, felled swaths of trees – including oaks that were several hundred years old – and diverted the underground spring that was their main water supply. The company says the hydro-dams are necessary for economic development, but the two artists have collaborated with scientists, lawyers and other environmental groups to reveal the plant is generating less than a fifth of its capacity, providing barely enough electricity for a single, mid-sized shopping mall. “We don’t want to be seen as anti-hydroelectric. But to say that because of the climate you need more alternatives,” Günal says. To demonstrate, they have installed a solar panel on their home. The photovoltaic energy has enabled them to operate drone patrols that exposed violations of environmental regulations. As a result, the company has received two hefty penalties. One more and its licence could be suspended. “We started by getting away from technology and now it ironic that we have become digital activists,” Erkutlu says. The couple are now connected by social networks to indigenous groups in the Amazon and Borneo, treehouse communities opposing opencast mining in Germany Hambach forest , anti-fracking campaigners in the UK and pipeline opponents in the US and Canada. “We didn’t realise this at first, but it global,” says Günal. “If you want to protect the environment, you are treated as a terrorist. It everywhere now.” But the cause is not hopeless. Public support for their campaign has prompted the government to create a protected area at the source of the Alakir river and to scrap two planned dams. The couple said more environmentally conscious urbanites should move into the countryside. “If we weren’t here, none of this would be here,” said Erkutlu. “The more people do what we do, the more areas will be guarded. Local people are not so educated and they are very afraid. But if you know the laws you can struggle. We are just two people from Istanbul. If we can do this, anybody can.”",987,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/we-have-become-guardians-turkeys-accidental-forest-protectors
74,"he bullet-proof is speeding through the countryside of western Colombia with two armed bodyguards, reggaeton is blasting out from the speakers, banana trees flit past the reinforced windows and the protected passenger – a threatened, recently bereaved campesino (poor farmer) – is explaining from bitter personal experience why he thinks Netflix Narcos TV series is trash. “It glorifies killers,” says Ramón Bedoya. “Drug dealers and paramilitaries. These are the type of people who murdered my dad.” The young man speaks with a maturity far beyond his years, perhaps because he has been forced to grow-up fast in the seven months since his father – a leader of the opposition to palm oil plantations – was assassinated by a gang linked to agribusiness and narco-traffickers. Hernán Bedoya was shot times on December while he was riding his horse to the vet in Pedeguita y Mancilla, Chocó. It was broad daylight when the two gunmen rode up by motorcycle and carried out the hit, but no witnesses dared to come forward. The death is among the most prominent in a wave of murders of land rights activists, environmental defenders, human rights campaigners, journalists and lawyers that followed the peace agreement between the Colombian government and Farc (Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia) rebels. That deal made headlines around the globe by bringing an end to the world longest-running civil war, which killed people over half a century. But in its wake, paramilitary groups have rushed to fill the power vacuum in former Farc-held territory. This pushed up the death toll of land defenders in Colombia last year to making it the third deadliest nation in the world. In Chocó – the nation most murderous region – these gangs provide the muscle for big extractive industries to ride roughshod over land rights and the environment. I want to continue this. My dad raised me to care for nature. We planted these trees together Ramón Bedoya Bedoya, who dresses in the typical style of a Colombian teenager in jeans, sneakers and a football shirt, has grown up in the shadow of this struggle. A journey to the family finca (farm) shows why his father was a target and why he now needs bodyguards. Outside the reinforced car, the path is highly exposed. It flanks a banana plantation, crosses a wooden plank over a muddy ditch, and passes through an area of scrubland before reaching a small fence and a sign declaring “ Mi Tierra (My Land) Biodiversity zone for the defence of life and territory. Area of protection, conservation and recuperation of native ecosystems, rights and food.” A panoply of international backers’ logos are emblazoned on the bottom: Christian Aid, Caritas Canada, InspirAction, Mundubat, Agencia Vasca. “I think the local businessmen hated that because it showed we had outside support,” says the young man. He and his father cleared half the land for cultivation of subsistence foods – corn, manioc , mango and papaya, but left the remainder as wild forest. They also collected and planted the seeds of rare native plants such as roble, romula leon and coracol (snail tree) – a rich contrast to the monoculture plantations of banana and African palm that surrounded the finca . “This is a last hold-out. Everywhere else has been cleared,” says Ramon. “I want to continue this. My dad raised me to care for nature. We planted these trees together.” He fears the same people who killed his father will try to kill him. Two bodyguards have been provided under a federal government protection programme, but there are still threats. He and his brother and mother had to evacuate one night after tip-offs of an imminent attack. The family say Hernan grandmother bought the plot in but they were driven off four years later by paramilitaries. The land was then taken over by the businessman Juan Guillermo Gonzáles Moreno, who owns a palm oil and fruit company called Cultivos Recife. The family returned in were evicted again in and returned once more in A year before he died, Hernan warned the palm oil companies planned to plant another hectares acres), which would be impossible unless he and more than a dozen other campesinos were dispossessed. Ramon believes his father death was ordered by a politician, who secures land for businesses with the hired muscle of the Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. This narco-army has its roots in the Los Pepes death squads that targeted Pablo Escobar Medellin cartel in the early The AGC – as it is most widely known – claims to be the country largest neo-paramilitary group with members. As well as cocaine smuggling, its former commander Vicente Castaño was a proponent of the palm oil business and used his forces to drive campesinos from their land in the late The same appears to be happening again, particularly in Chocó. This mountainous and forested western department – which is home to just of Colombia population – has seen of the forced displacements since the peace deal as more than Afro-Colombians and indigenous people have been driven from their farms. As extractive industries move in, those that resist become targets. Ten days before killing Hernan, it is alleged the AGC murdered Mario Castaño, who was leading a campaign against the AngloGold Ashanti mining project in nearby Larga Tumaradó, Urabá. The police do little to stop this. Those who are not corrupt are too weak to counter the paramilitaries. The most the federal government does is provide bulletproof vests, mobile phones and – in extreme cases – bodyguards. Ramon Bedoya is undaunted. He plans to study law, become a rights activist and realise his father ambition to restore the forest and build a “great finca ” with trees and cows. The key he says is the support and understanding of the outside world – environmental NGOs, the United Nations and consumers. “People would use less palm oil if they could see the damage it is doing to people lives and to the environment. The companies take our land and give nothing back.” The odds are stacked against the but he is his father son. “I want to finish what he started,” he says as we return to the car and drive back past the plantations. “We campesinos can win. There are many of us and we are ready to fight for our rights.

75,"eep in the heart of Africa, a dedicated group of rangers patrol the Chinko nature reserve . In baking equatorial heat, they are weighed down with body armour and camouflage fatigues. Beads of sweat run down their faces; mosquitos whine. The men keep watch over a vast patchwork of savanna and rainforest in the Central African Republic – a country mired in civil strife and one of the many frontlines of a poaching war that spans the continent and reaches across the globe. Chinko rangers are the guardians of an ecosystem that is home to a rich variety of species. These include buffalos, chimpanzees, forest elephants, leopards, lions and the icon of this park, the giant eland – an imposing antelope. With no permanent human settlement, the land around the Chinko river basin offers one of the largest intact wildernesses in central Africa . But these rangers face an array of dangers: poachers, rebel militants, cattle herders, diamond miners. All of these intruders are well-armed and determined to rip out the resources from this remote sanctuary. Day-to-day, Chinko is managed by David Simpson, a from North Yorkshire. Poaching and cattle migrations would present enough of a conservation headache. But the struggle to protect Chinko is made even harder by a brutal armed conflict that has engulfed the country for years. War broke out in when a predominantly-Muslim rebel coalition known as the Séléka overthrew the government and committed widespread atrocities. An alliance of mostly Christian militias known as the anti-balaka carried out vicious reprisals, with subsequent clashes killing thousands. After a brief lull, the Séléka splintered into rival groups, with violence uprooting hundreds of thousands of people. Last year, fighting brought the country humanitarian crisis to Chinko. Militants attacked a nearby town and forced more than civilians into the reserve ; Chinko employees have offered them food and shelter, and, more recently, helped them return home. Chinko is run by African Parks , a conservation non-profit with a ranger force that operates in a network of reserves spanning hectares across nine countries. Last year, the organisation says its rangers removed more than snares and traps, confiscated almost tonnes of bushmeat and helped secure convictions. “Rangers are the frontline defence against the intense and ever-present risk of poaching in Africa critical conservation areas,” said African Parks CEO, Peter Fearnhead. “Their efforts are building a future in which people and wildlife can benefit from stable and ecologically functioning landscapes.” Each dry season, armed nomads lead thousands of cows from Chad and Sudan towards grasslands further south, poaching wildlife on the side and lighting massive wildfires. In recent years, cattle swarmed through the park. But outreach campaigns, ranger patrols and the occasional shoot-out have pushed out these herders and their mass of cows, creating an environment for wildlife to thrive once more. In this, one of the most anarchic and marginalised areas on Earth, Chinko rangers are the region sole security force. Such threats are by no means confined only to Chinko. In wildlife reserves across the world, rangers put their lives on the line daily to protect our shared natural heritage from poachers whose brutal trade is fuelled by the insatiable demand for bushmeat, ivory, animal skin and traditional medicine. July each year is World Ranger day – an occasion that commemorates the rangers killed or injured in the field. The day also celebrates the work of these courageous men and women who protect the planet endangered species and natural treasures, often at great personal sacrifice, far from their families.

76,"Indigenous people in the Brazilian Amazon are mourning the murder of a community leader who campaigned to protect the forest from logging amid escalating violence in the region. Jorginho Guajajara, a cacique, or leader, of the Guajajara people, was found dead near a river in the city of Arame, Maranhão state, at the weekend. Members of the tribe say his death was the result of a fierce conflict provoked by the incursion of loggers into their land. Up to Guajajaras have been killed in the area since Protect the lone Amazonian tribesman. He deserves to live in peace | Fiona Watson “Jorginho body was found dumped by a stream which is renowned for being a dumping ground for Guajajaras killed by loggers or people connected to them,” said Sarah Shenker, a senior researcher at Survival International , the global movement for tribal peoples’ rights. Guajajara supported a group called the Guardians of Amazon , who have taken direct action to reduce illegal logging in the Araeibóia reserve in Maranhão state: tying up loggers, burning their trucks and tractors, and kicking them off the reserves. The Guardians say they defend the forest for their families and for the uncontacted Awá people that live in the same territory. “Given they are uncontacted, they are extremely vulnerable people, who will face a catastrophe unless their land is protected,” Shenker says. “Survival International has been pressuring the Brazilian government to protect the land and also to protect the land defenders – as well as to investigate and bring all criminals to justice.” Indigenous activist Sônia Guajajara, – who is from the Araribóia reserve and is currently running as vice-presidential candidate for the Socialism and Freedom party, said: “Our people are dying on their land. This was not an isolated case, but part of an ongoing genocide.” Guajajara candidacy has cast the spotlight on the Guajajaras, one of Brazil largest indigenous groups, who inhabit more than protected areas in the eastern margin of the Amazon in Maranhão. This area is subject to intense deforestation, and according to government data, of the biome in the state has already been cleared. “Maranhão is a state with a high rate of indigenous conflicts,” she said. “The loggers enter our territories to exploit our natural resources, and the violence escalates. Many leaders are being threatened by these invaders and we urgently need to end this situation; we do not want to lose any more relatives who fight and protect our Mother Earth.”",413,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/16/brazil-jorginho-guajajara-amazon-indigenous-leader
77,"onfiscated bottles of cyanide, fishing dynamite and more than chainsaws decorate the office of Robert Chan , leader of arguably the world most effective direct-action eco-vigilante organisation. The Palawan NGO Network Incorporated risk their lives to protect reefs and coastal forests in the Coral Triangle, a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and violent environmental crime. Operating in the biggest province in the Philippines , the small group of activists enforce conservation laws that usually go ignored by local police and coastguards. Chan – a long-haired, music-loving bundle of energy, ideas and enthusiasm – initiated this campaign in “We had to do enforcement work because the government wasn’t doing it,” he said. “We can’t stand watching our resources being destroyed in front of our faces.” The campaign remarkable record is apparent at the group headquarters in Puerto Princesa , which has become a scrapyard monument to citizen action – and sacrifice. Illegal fishing vessels have been towed into the yard, which is ringed by a fence of rusting chainsaws, some of which are also stacked into a high tower. There are bundles too of barbed wire, pulled from the boundaries of unlicensed development projects linked to powerful businessmen and politicians. Inside, the walls and cabinets are filled with homemade guns seized from poachers, and explosives and poisons illicitly used to flush fish from the corals so they can be sold to home aquarium owners in China. On the sofas, Chan is singing karaoke and drinking beer with his colleagues at a late-night goodbye party for a departing member of the team. It is an important moment of light relief for activists engaged in an extraordinarily dangerous job. Unlike many of their adversaries, they do not use guns. Instead they rely on stealth, support from local communities and a little-known citizen arrest law to intercept and disarm those involved in forest crime. “We have had eight dead and dozens injured and countless threats,” says Chan, who is at such high risk that he no longer dares to leave the group headquarters. He has been repeatedly warned to stop his activities, which also include legal challenges and media campaigns. In the Palawan governor, Jose Chaves Alvarez, was so incensed by Chan opposition to a mining project that he publicly fumed : “What does he want, war? If he wants, we can square off, the two of us.” Yet Chan – an environmental lawyer – continues to coordinate monitoring work and challenge tourism, plantation and mining projects that are likely to lead to forest clearance or pollution run-off into the turquoise waters around the island, which are increasingly suffering from coral bleaching and wildlife loss. Asked what keeps him going, he refers to his Catholic faith. “God wants you to act on what in front of you; one tree at a time, one beach at a time, one politician at a time.” Donors are reluctant to provide funds for such dangerous interventions, but Chan calls for laws to strengthen the powers of communities to take direct action and confiscate and compound vehicles and tools used illegally. If left to the government or international organisations, he believes nothing gets done. “They end up trying to stop a logger or dynamite fisherman by holding a heavily funded environmental education workshop or seminar, while programmes like ours beg for gas money and are often put down, ignored or downplayed,” he says. “We need open-minded policymakers and funding agencies that will support third world solutions to third world problems, and not first world remedies that are intellectually stimulating and really look good on paper but have no real effect.”",601,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/god-wants-you-to-act-on-whats-in-front-of-you-enforcing-conservation-law-in-the-coral-triangle
78,"A criminal gang involved in land trafficking has tortured and murdered a community leader in northern Peru , according to his wife and local villagers who witnessed the killing. José Napoleón Tarrillo Astonitas, was attacked by four men in his home on Saturday night. His wife, Flor Vallejos, told police he was bound by his hands and feet, beaten with a stick and strangled with an electric cable. Six farmers shot dead over land rights battle in Peru As she was covered in a blanket and forced to listen to her husband screams, the attackers told him they had been paid to kill him, Vallejos told a national radio station. A local police chief said a murder investigation had been opened and the killers were being hunted. A community leader in El Mirador village, Tarrillo, known as Napo, opposed land traffickers who had taken over parts of the Chaparrí Ecological Reserve and were clearing land and sowing crops. The reserve is a wildlife hotspot, with one of the largest populations of the rare spectacled bear in South America. Vallejos said her husband had received death threats from people within his community for opposing deforestation and land invasions in the private reserve. “He was threatened two days before he was killed,” says Juan Carrasco, a fellow member of the Muchik Santa Catalina de Chongoyape farming community, in Peru northern Lambayeque region. “He was a brave man and he never lost his nerve. He said we must organise our own patrol to evict the land invaders because the authorities would not take action.” “This was to be expected,” Ana Juarez, a biologist working in the area, told the Guardian. Juarez claims the murderers are known to the community and were responsible for the brutal killing of three farmers in October in reprisal for the eviction of land traffickers from the nearby San Francisco de Salas community. Famous for its spectacled bears, the inspiration for the fictional Paddington Bear, the Chaparrí reserve receives visitors from all over the world. It is considered a model for community ecotourism and generates income for the local people. The reserve is also home to the critically endangered white-winged guan, a bird once thought extinct. North-west Peru is considered a hotspot for endemic bird species. Heinz Plenge, a renowned Peruvian wildlife photographer and one of the founders of the private reserve, says the criminals operate with “absolute impunity” and that land traffickers have infiltrated the peasant community which owns the communal land on which the reserve is situated. The defenders: recording the deaths of environmental defenders around the world The announcement of an irrigation project for the Lambayeque region in which would place two reservoirs in the Chaparrí reserve, sent land prices skyrocketing, Plenge explains. The project is on hold, but some land prices have risen from to per hectare, he says. “These mafias are trying to grab hold of as much communal land as possible and take over peasant communities which can be easily bought off,” he adds. “These lands are bought up by small operators, but behind them are politicians and very powerful businessmen.” Javier Ruiz Gutierrez, founder of the Save Chaparrí Defence Front, said the land traffickers are “trying to terrorise the population” so they can clear land for the proposed reservoir, which could transform the reserve into prime agricultural land. “The absence of an effective government response to environmental crimes exposes local conservationists to intense social pressures, violence, and death threats, which are often carried through,” said Noga Shanee, a local conservationist and founder of the Neotropical Primate Conservation NGO. “In this case, like in many others, reports were filed to all the relevant authorities about forest destruction and death threats, but were repeatedly ignored,” she adds.

79,"ot all land defenders fight in remote forests and coastlands. Some take the battle to the centres of power: to courtrooms, parliament buildings and corporate headquarters. The veneer of urban civility may be glossier here, but the struggle is no less dangerous. In some cases, it can be worse. Isela Gonzalez has been threatened more times than she can remember by university-educated men in suits, whose business interests – in logging, mining, agriculture and narcotics – are challenged by her work as director of Alianza Sierra Madre to protect indigenous land rights in Mexico western Sierra Madre. The warnings have been muttered on steps outside legal hearings, whispered on the phone, or via conversations she has been deliberately allowed to overhear. They are not idle. The nurse-turned-activist has seen dozens of her fellow campaigners murdered in recent years. Armed guards have been deployed by the state to provide her with protection, panic-buttons have been installed in her office, locks have been upgraded in her home, and she and her staff have received crisis training. But her enemies, she says, can hire an assassin for as little as pesos or a few bottles of beer, regardless of whether she is in a remote village or Chihuahua city. “Even if I am not in the community a hitman could come and kill me,” she says. “We have protocols to protect us but we are at high risk, and we are conscious, fully aware that even if we have bodyguards, if they want to do something to us they will do it.” Mexico is rapidly becoming one of the most dangerous countries in the world for environment and land activists. In defenders were killed (a more than fivefold rise over the previous year), pushing the nation up from to place in the grim global rankings . All but two of the victims were indigenous. The most prominent in recent years was Isidro Baldenegro López, a Tarahumara leader who won the Goldman environment prize for his efforts to protect the old-growth forests of pine and oak in the Sierra Madre. He was killed by a gunman in January . The backdrop is a broader wave of assassinations and disappearances of civil rights activists and journalists in Mexico. While narco-gangs are usually blamed, the state is often complicit . Senior politicians receive bribes and kickbacks for granting lucrative mining and logging concessions on indigenous land. When local communities resist attempts to clear their forests, pollute their rivers or destroy their crops, they are met with violence and assassinations. “This is about the government giving permits to exploit everything recently,” she says. “And then you have communities who don’t want to sell the land, they have a different vision of things, they want to keep things as they are.” Gonzalez has no material incentive to risk her life. She is not a member of the indigenous groups that she defends. She has no land at stake. She simply believes it is the right thing to do. A nurse by training, she later switched to anthropology. Some years ago, her research took her for the first time to isolated villages among the pine-oak forests of the Sierra Madre, where she spent time with three tribes – the Rarámuri, Ódami and Tepehuán (who are together jointly named the Tarahumara by outsiders). She was awestruck by their social structure, use of forest medicines and relationship with the land. “It clear that they have a special connection at a spiritual level. They only take what they need, they never take more than that, they really care about the environment and the way that they interact with the forest,” she says. “It a culture that laughs, it a culture that knows how to smile. I learned that other living beings such as animals and trees, water and plants, we shouldn’t see them as different from us but as a whole.” Gonzalez group – Alianza Sierra Madre – initially started out as a biodiversity NGO. But they changed strategy when they realised the frontline of environmental protection was indigenous land. The constitution and law is nominally on the side of indigenous groups, who account for about a sixth of Mexico million population. They have the right to prior informed consent before any use of their land. But their territory is often disputed because for centuries they lived without any need for documentary proof of ownership. Even when they have it, the authorities often bypass them to grant concessions for mining, logging and agribusiness (often resulting in illegal marijuana or opium poppy crops). The public justification is economic development. The private reality is bribes and personal interests. To defend the Tarahumara rights, Gonzalez has organised protests, led occupations of government offices, filed lawsuits and compiled dossiers for the national government, the Inter-American Court for Human Rights and the United Nations. Part of her motivation is to ensure the deaths of her friends is not for nothing. “I keep doing this because some of these men and some of these women are not with us anymore. I am just telling a story; this is their story.” With risks rising, she now rarely visits the communities, but still campaigns on behalf of the or so people who she describes as her companions in the struggle. “Now that I cannot go, I have this urge to do something, to fill my day with activities, working towards the same goal, helping the communities because I wish I could be there.” At years old, many people of her age might think of retiring, but she has no intention of easing up. “I think of myself as a senior, I think I could stay in my home cooking for my family, I think I could just go out with my friends, but how could I do that when I know that this culture exists? I believe in this fight and I believe we need to change as a country and I believe the world needs to change. This is something that I will keep doing with Alianza or without them. My family knows this and I believe that I won’t stop until this is fixed or until I die.” For those who want to fight alongside her, she says the only way to confront destructive economic interests is through civic activism and political change. If people see the fight for the Earth as distant, alien and unwinnable, she fears they will give up hope. For Gonzalez, this plays into the hands of those who want to seize the land. “They use ignorance and apathy in their favour. This is the struggle that we have. Our society should make it their own.” She believes Mexico is descending into a situation like that of Colombia, a nation with too many guns, too many drugs and a conflict between on one side – big corporate extractivists and the state – and on the other, a cluster of militias and insurgents fighting for the land rights of poor, often indigenous, communities. Dealing with this growing conflict requires political action, better laws and a realisation of what the fight for the land and environment really means. “We as a country are at war and we need to address this,” she says.",1207,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/nowhere-is-safe-for-mexicos-land-defenders-as-violence-grows
80,"s a child, Nonhle Mbuthuma would wake up in her family thatched hut listening to the waves crashing on South Africa Wild Coast , then go and play on the sand dunes, head off to school or help her parents cultivate sweet potatoes and bananas on the family plot. Today, she can rarely stay in the same place for any length of time and is more likely to be keeping her ears alert to signs of danger. At times she needs bodyguards or goes into hiding. “I wake up each morning and thank God I am still alive,” said the Amadiba woman, who has been told she is on a hit list. “I know I am a target. My husband and my family and friends are worried. They tell me to go into hiding. But I can’t do that. It not me. I choose this road.” She is battling for her community right to say no to the exploitation of their territory. South African judges have been considering this question since April, when Mbuthuma and her neighbours got their day in court against an Australian mining company that has pushed for access to lucrative titanium deposits discovered in the russet dunes where she used to play. Defence of this land – located in an ecologically rich coastal region of Pondoland – has pitted Mbuthuma against her tribal chief and the regional government. Several of her fellow campaigners have been killed after being warned not to oppose a project that would bring jobs and money to one of the poorest regions in South Africa . Mbuthuma is uncowed. She says residents of her village of Xolobeni are overwhelmingly opposed and without their approval, the mining company and its supporters should back off. “The law says we have a right to be consulted, but what we say doesn’t seem to matter. We have told the company many times that we don’t want their mine. How many times do we have to say no?” she asks. The is an accidental activist. During her teens, she found work as guide for foreigners wanting to see the Pondoland biodiversity zone which sits between sub-tropical and temperate climates. As well as a multitude of endemic species, visitors were attracted by whales off the coast and rugged inland landscape that was used for the set of the film Blood Diamond. With the European Union planning to back further eco-tourism projects, it looked for a while as if this could be a turning point in the development of this region, Life changed with the arrival of an Australian mining company Mineral Commodities with still bigger investment plans to turn the area into an opencast pit for the extraction of zircon, rutile and titanium, which is used in countless products including laptop computers, bicycles, golf clubs, watches and drill bits. The proposal, which aimed to generate annual revenues of for the life of the mine, divided the Amadiba community. Those living in the inland half were largely in favour because their land would be relatively unaffected, they would have a new road and the possibility of jobs. Residents closer to the coast were opposed. They feared they would lose their farms, that rivers would be contaminated, wildlife driven away and future generations condemned to a miserable existence in townships. They also suspected a racial hangover from the apartheid era. During that period of segregation and white rule, Pondoland was designated a homeland under black tribal rule. This meant nominal political autonomy but economic neglect. Twenty-six years on, Mbuthuma says its legacy remains. “Why are they doing this here? Why not in a white area? It is because it is cheaper. Discrimination is still entrenched in our economy.” Her inspiration is her grandfather, a veteran of the Pondoland revolt, one of the first major protests against apartheid. “He told me all the stories about how he used to fight and why. It was to keep the land and ensure the people are happy. Now he says it is up to me, that my decisions must not hurt the next generation.” She says her tribe current chieftain has failed in this task by accepting a directorship in the mining company and a new in return for approving a deal he had no right to make. Tradition, she said, dictated that such big decisions could only be made by consensus at a meeting in the great hall of the tribe. The mining company said it was listening to community leaders and opponents’ fears are largely unfounded. It promised not to destroy homes, to leave dunes untouched, to create buffer zones beside ecologically sensitive areas and to restore the land after the work is finished. “The company believes that the development of the mine and the balancing of the environmental impacts with the social and economic upliftment can be managed to the satisfaction of all stakeholders,” said Mark Caruso, executive chairman of Mineral Commodities, which is now in the process of divesting its share in the project. What nobody doubts is that the once strong community is now violently divided. Mbuthuma and others opposed to the mine formed the Amadiba crisis committee in In four of their members were assaulted in the wake of a visit by mining consultants. A year later, the leader of the group, Sikhosiphi “Bazooka” Rhadebe – was shot dead after he organised a road block to forestall drilling operations. Mbuthuma feels threatened by the supporters of the mining project. “Bazooka said we were on a hit list. He warned me to go into hiding,” she said. “His last words to me were ‘Go home, stay indoors. Those guys are after us’.” Although she does not trust the police, she has faith in the courts and the power of international public opinion. In the wake of Rhadebe killing, the government imposed a moratorium on the mining project. It is due to expire later this year, but Mbuthuma hopes her legal case, which was heard in the Pretoria high court in April will be decided before then. Her lawyer, Johan Lorenzen, says judges have the chance to clear a hangover of the apartheid era by recognising the right of communities like Xolobeni to say no to mineral extraction. “Mining is South Africa original sin. There a fetish around it,” he said. “But this case can be precedent-making. If we win, it will dramatically change the power dynamics.” Mbuthuma sees the issue more in terms of choice and participation. She is not rejecting investments, but wants to be sure they are not destructive and that they serve local people over the long term. “When it comes to development, you have to be involved. You can’t just think about now. You have to think about tomorrow.”",1124,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/i-thank-god-i-am-alive-standing-firm-against-mineral-extraction-in-south-africa
81,"“For me, there are two very important anthropological concepts,” says Patrick Friesen, speaking Spanish with a thick accent. He is a descendant of protestant Mennonites who left Europe to found agricultural colonies in the arid region of the Paraguayan Chaco; he is also the communication manager of Chortitzer, one of the three large Mennonite cooperatives that dominate the economy of this inhospitable part of the country. “The first [concept] is that people from the north[ern hemisphere] need to stockpile. They work from sunrise to sunset, investing, so they can survive the winter. But a person from the south, to put it crudely, can sit under a mango tree and wait for a mango to fall on his head. Nature provides security,” he says, differentiating what he believes to be the mental maps of the Mennonites and the indigenous peoples who have been living together in the Chaco for a century. Formed by dry forests resistant to drought and scalding temperatures, the Chaco occupies more than half the land in Paraguay . Over the past decade, cattle farming in this region has grown rapidly and it now has of the country livestock population, and is increasingly becoming the crucible of Paraguay growing export industry, selling soybeans, meat and leather to the rest of the world. But as Paraguay export market develops and the country becomes a bigger player in the international market, the darker side of the Chaco region is coming into focus, with reports of illegal deforestation and slave labour among the indigenous population. So far only one case has actually resulted in a conviction. In November on a farm called Estância Ruroka, government inspectors found people working and living in inhumane conditions on a farm in the department of Boquerón, near the border with Bolivia. The workers were Aché people recruited nearly a thousand kilometres from their communities to produce charcoal from native forest felled to prepare the way for grassland. The group included children and adolescents with injuries on their hands caused by the charcoal kilns. Sleeping on mattresses on the ground and protected from the sun only by plastic tarpaulins, the group did not have enough drinking water to quench their thirst, though temperatures can reach in the Chaco. The workers were also in debt to pay for food from the recruiters. In an attempt to save money, they even went without dinner. The inspection was carried out by the public prosecutor office after they received a complaint. “The situation needs to be under much stricter control,” says Teresa Martínez, Paraguay public prosecutor. “If it not watched, these things will continue to happen. In this case, we went because they asked for help. But we have a problem: the inspectors cannot enter without a warrant. And for us to get this warrant, we need to intervene [through the courts].” The working conditions in the region, she argues, are “a form of slave labour… They work in camps, move from one place to another on farms, with their things. All they have to use, kitchen utensils, sleeping things, everything they have to buy. The foremen deduct this from what they have to receive as wages. And they usually do not pay until the six months are over so they do not leave. So they stay until they meet the deadline they told them. And when they get six months they owe a lot of money for the food, the clothes, the boots. It really a form of slavery.” But there are numerous obstacles in the way of effective oversight, not least the fact that even the most senior Paraguayan authorities are reluctant to admit there is a problem. It is not difficult to find public statements by government ministers of former president Horacio Cartes – himself a big landowner and rancher in the Chaco – playing down or even denying the existence of slave labour. As one local governor said : “Many people come here from different regions looking for work. Here they will only find good work and good pay.” But the nature of the global market is such that these problems no longer stay local. The long twisted tendrils of global supply chains can now stretch all the way from the dusty empty roads of the Chaco tosome of the best known brands in the world – even when those brands are based in glossy, glassy European headquarters half a planet away. A joint investigation by Repórter Brasil and the Guardian uncovered potential links between Estancia Ruroka and some of the world largest car firms, including BMW, Citroën, Peugeot and Renault. All four have been supplied with leather either directly or indirectly by Cencoprod, a company run by the three Mennonite cooperatives that dominate the economy of the Chaco, one of which is Chortitzer. The farmer convicted of trafficking - Rudi Kauenhowen Friesen - is an associate of Chortitzer. Repórter Brasil and the Guardian approached the car firms about the case. BMW said it was unaware of the conviction involving an associate of the Chortitzer cooperative, but confirmed that one of its leather suppliers purchased materials from Cencoprod. “In cases like this, we conduct an investigation with our direct supplier to check the facts,” the company said. “The BMW Group definitively does not tolerate any kind of violation of human rights in its production chains.” BMW said the Ruroka ranch – where the slave labour was found – was not a supplier of Cencoprod and, therefore, was not directly involved in its supply chain. Renault and the PSA group (responsible for the Citroën and Peugeot brands) stated that their leather supplier – the Italian company Italthierry Auto Leather Spa – stopped buying from Cencoprod in Renault reaffirmed their commitment to “have an active sustainable purchasing policy encompassing respect for human rights, labor law, compliance, safety, quality and the environment”. But Europe remains a vital market for Paraguayan leather, with hundreds of tonnes being shipped into Italy alone in the last year. And while the Chaco area remains so under-regulated it is a risk European companies cannot continue to ignore. Cencoprod and Italthierry were approached but did not comment. Traceability The economy of the Paraguayan Chaco revolves around cattle farming. According to a study conducted by the environmental organisation Guyra, one third of the native vegetation in the region has already been transformed into grassland. “What concerns us the most is that nearly of the deforestation is completely illegal,” said Alberto Yanoski, director of Guyra. The urban centres founded by Mennonite colonists are home to more than descendants of European immigrants. In these cities, it is not unusual to come across traffic signs in German. It is also common to see children with light eyes and fair hair playing in well-kept gardens. On the weekends, the Protestant churches are filled with Mennonites. The headquarters of the three Mennonite cooperatives that dominate the economy of the Chaco are also located in this region. Besides competing in the beef industry with their own processing plants, they also operate in the leather market through Cencoprod. Tackling issues of traceability and sustainability has been a major focus in recent years, says Chortitzer communication manager Friesen. “Obviously, the customer is king. If the customer wants traceability, then we have to comply,” he says. “We have very strict rules regarding the traceability of livestock and the by-products.” However, he says, Chortitzer was not buying livestock from Estancia Ruroka, and so those systems did not apply. It is an extremely large cooperative, Friesen explains. “Chortitzer is responsible for promoting the socio-economic development of some partners, providing them with all services in the production, processing and sale of products in the local, national and international markets.” “We as a cooperative do not, as a rule, require our partners to do anything,” he says. When asked about the Ruroka case, he replies: “We can encourage them, motivate them and also tell the member that they will face the legal consequences. We do not protect them if they do something wrong.” As he points out, “the cooperative is not a police entity, or a citizen control body.” He hopes that the Paraguayan state willstep up its oversight in the Chaco region. “Paraguay branding is in the hands not only of the private sector, but also of the government,” he said. In March this year, the Paraguayan ministry of labour opened an office in the city of Filadelfia specifically to receive complaints from indigenous people. The sole employee in the office is Erundina Gómez, an indigenous woman whose father “worked for years at a farm and never got paid a dime”. She knows that the situation experienced by her father still occurs today. In February this year, four indigenous teenagers aged to were found by the police on a farm where they had been abandoned by a recruiter without food or water. They had been brought in to produce charcoal at a farm owned by a Mennonite colonist in the region. In September, the United Nations is expected to release an official report on slave labour in the Paraguayan Chaco.",1512,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/forced-labour-in-paraguay-the-darkness-at-the-bottom-of-the-global-supply-chain
82,"Europe animal farming sector has exceeded safe bounds for greenhouse gas emissions , nutrient flows and biodiversity loss , and urgently needs to be scaled back, according to a major report . Pressure on livestock farmers is set to intensify this century as global population and income growth raises demand for meat-based products beyond the planet capacity to supply it. The paper co-author, Professor Allan Buckwell, endorses a Greenpeace call for halving meat and dairy production by , and his report broadside is squarely aimed at the heart of the EU policy establishment. Share your stories from inside the farming industry Launching the report, the EU former environment commissioner Janez Potocnik said: “Unless policymakers face up to this now, livestock farmers will pay the price of their inactivity. ‘Protecting the status quo’ is providing a disservice to the sector.” The study calls for the European commission to urgently set up a formal inquiry mandated to propose measures – including taxes and subsidies – that “discourage livestock products harmful to health, climate or the environment”. Livestock has the world largest land footprint and is growing fast, with close to of the planet agricultural land now used for grazing and animal feed production, even though meat delivers just of our calories . Europeans already eat more than twice as much meat as national dietary authorities recommend – far beyond a “safe operating space” within environmental limits, says the Rise foundation study. As a result, huge sectoral “adjustments” will be needed by to rebalance the sector, including a drop in greenhouse gas emissions and a cut in nitrate-based fertiliser use, it finds. Long before then, policymakers, farmers and society as a whole face “deeply uncomfortable choices”, according to Buckwell. “We’re talking about fewer meat meals, less meat portions and moving to flexitarian diets without being dogmatic about it,” he said. “There is a role for softer public health messaging but harder messages are necessary too.” Such a transformation “won’t happen spontaneously”, he added. “It requires strong signals from government so the policy proposal must include measures to discourage consumption of livestock products harmful to public health and the environment.” Buckwell called for targeted taxes on harmful practices, with subsidised meat for low-income consumers, and a realignment of funding regimes to advise, retrain and hire more farmers for work in rural landscape management and animal welfare. The hope is that consumers will eventually pay more for high quality meat produced in environmentally safe conditions, where countryside protection and animal welfare have been guaranteed. 'It not if, it when': the deadly pig disease spreading around the world The study follows angry condemnation of the EU recent common agricultural policy reform, which ignored a growing clamour for moves to more sustainable food systems . Addressing the launch in a video message, the EU agriculture commissioner, Phil Hogan – who dismissed the sector emissions footprint earlier this year – said that he too wanted it to become “smarter, greener and cleaner, and do so fast”. But his claim that more farm efficiency was the answer was slammed as “inherently contradictory” by BirdLife Europe policy chief, Ariel Brunner. The most sustainable farms are often less “efficient” in narrow terms of profit and loss, he argued, unless broader questions of energy and nutrition are considered. One of the largest barriers to this sustainable food vision is Europe farmers themselves, still reeling from the financial blow dealt by this year drought. Liam MacHale, the secretary-general of the Irish Farmers’ Association, told the Guardian that farmers were “an easy target” for environmentalists. “Don’t single out our sector,” he warned the report authors. “Look at greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture is blamed but look at consumer behaviour in the transport sector. They need to fly abroad to relax [despite] the emissions associated with that. The airlines are not being closed down, yet you’re talking about possibly eliminating the livestock sector.” Buckwell told the Guardian he envisaged a contraction of the sector of between “We have to contract consumption by roughly half to come within the safe operating space – a big change, in other words.”",682,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/15/europe-meat-dairy-production-2050-expert-warns
83,"Amputations, fractured fingers, second-degree burns and head trauma are just some of the serious injuries suffered by US meat plant workers every week, according to data seen by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism . US meat workers are already three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker, and pork and beef workers nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries. And some fear that plans to remove speed restrictions on pig processing lines – currently being debated by the government – will only make the work more difficult. Government and industry bodies point out that there have been reductions in worker injury rates over the last couple of decades, although the figures still remain higher than average. They argue that despite the lifting of speed restrictions, the need to adhere to strict rules on food safety will impose its own limit on line speeds . Records compiled by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reveal that, on average, there are at least “severe” incidents a month in US meat plants. These injuries are classified as those involving “hospitalisations, amputations or loss of an eye”. Amputations happen on average twice a week, according to the data. There were incidents in a period spanning to according to the OSHA figures. Most of the incidents involved the amputation of fingers or fingertips, but there were recordings of lost hands, arms or toes. During the period there were a total of serious injuries which cover of the states so the true total for the USA would be substantially higher. Recorded injuries include: An employee left arm had to be surgically amputated at the shoulder after it was pulled into the cubing machine during sanitation A worker was reaching down to pick up a box to clear a jam when his jacket became caught in a roller. As he tried to pull it out, his hand got pulled in as well. His hand and lower arm were crushed While an employee was attempting to remove the ribs from the spine of a cattle rib set, his hand made contact with a running vertical band saw and two of his fingers were amputated An employee working on a sanitation crew pushed the stop button after removing parts from the upper portion of a machine. The employee then placed his foot into a horizontal grinder while climbing down from the machine, causing all five toes on his right foot to be amputated A worker was clearing the hydrolyzer when back pressure caused hot feathers to discharge on to him. As he moved out of the way, he fell six feet, breaking a bone over his left eye and suffering first- and second-degree burns to the hands, arms, face and neck. Chronic ailments are an even bigger issue, leaving many workers permanently disabled, and leading to losses and costs, both individually and publicly. According to one published study, carpal tunnel syndrome costs more than annually in medical treatment costs alone, for workers in all US industries. “Every co-worker I know has been injured at some point,” plant worker Eric Fuerstenberg told the USDA as they examined the case for implementing reforms that would include speeding up the line. “I can attest that the line speeds are already too fast to keep up with. Please, I am asking you not to increase them any more.” A meat plant worker who asked to remain anonymous told the Guardian that although he has managed to avoid injury himself, most of his friends have needed surgery at some point. “If you complain about your hands, they just say you’ll be fine … they want you to put ice on it during your break time or lunchtime” – rather than during production hours. The year-old worker, from Nebraska, adds, “When I get home I have to stretch my hands, I feel a pinch, it hurts... You never get used to the work. I do it because I have to support my family. I don’t have an education.” Amanda Hitt, from the Food Integrity Campaign, said: “Increased line speeds pose a real threat to workers. In addition to heinous injuries resulting from speed such as amputations and physical injury, workers are also at risk from injuries resulting from repeated motions. A pork plant worker may make … hard-cutting knife motions while working on a line. This repetition puts the worker at risk [of] debilitating musculoskeletal problems.” However, official injury rates in the sector have been reduced over the last years after an industry and government push to improve training and guidelines. “Worker safety is considered a non-competitive issue in the meat and poultry industry,” said Eric Mittenthal, spokesman for the North American Meat Institute (NAMI), “meaning companies openly share best practices with each other at meetings throughout the year, with the goal of making our facilities as safe as possible for the people working in them.” Training has been increased, say industry bodies, and, in a joint effort with the unions, the government and industry, a set of voluntary ergonomic guidelines for the meat packing industry has been drawn up, described by OSHA as a model for other sectors. “And these efforts have really paid off,” said Mittenthal. “In we saw all-time lows for industry injury and illness rates.” According to the most recent data published by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics “injury incidence in the meat and poultry packing and processing industries has decreased significantly over the past years, reaching an all-time low of cases per full-time workers per year”. There remains, according to the Government Accountability Office, a persistent problem of under-reporting. In according to BLS data , the incidence rate for injuries for meat packing plants was over In the case of “lost workday injuries”, points out Mittenthal, the rate for animal slaughtering and processing was cases per workers versus for “all industries including private state and local government”. A number of industries have higher rates than this. However, some fear that aspects of a new system being piloted by the USDA may stall that progress. The New Swine Slaughter Inspection System (NSIS) will re-allocate some of the line inspection duties, and remove speed caps from the processing lines. USDA estimates that it could potentially save the agency more than a year. But the plans will lead to more injuries, believe unions and workers. “When it production at all costs, people are going to get hurt,” said Mark Lauritsen, head of the meatpacking division for United Food and Commercial Workers (the main union for meat plant worker in the US). “There really no need for this, taking the caps off the line speed – there plenty of capacity to kill plenty of pigs … but they’re just getting greedy about it.” “I am strongly opposed to any provision that would allow employers to increase the number of forceful repetitions workers are required to perform,” David Michaels, the former top OSHA administrator under President Obama, wrote in response to the plans. “The proposed rule allows employers to increase the line speed without adding additional workers. This will, without doubt, increase worker injuries and illnesses.” But NAMI argues that the removal of line speed caps is not about speeding things up, but about allowing the line inspector to decide a speed that is appropriate for safety. Plants would not be capped at pigs per hour, but they could only operate as fast as adhering to food safety rules would allow, said a NAMI spokesperson. In fact, under the pilot programmes that have been running, some plants actually ran more slowly than the current capped rate, they point out. The USDA believes that the current inspection system forces vets to concentrate on areas that actually are not the priority for food safety concerns. They believe the NSIS will “improve animal welfare and compliance with the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA); improve the effectiveness of swine slaughter inspection; make more efficient use of the agency resources; and remove unnecessary regulatory obstacles to innovation”.",1341,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/amputations-serious-injuries-us-meat-industry-plant
84,"The number of male calves being killed straight after birth is on the rise again, despite efforts by the dairy industry to end the practice known as ‘the dirty secret’. A Guardian analysis shows that it can cost a farmer up to per calf to sell it on for beef or veal, while early disposal costs just A growing number of farmers feel compelled to take the latter option, with killed on-farm in the most recent set of figures. We get the knackerman out to do it. I could never do it. Anonymous dairy farmer Dairy farms depend on female cows to produce milk, so when male calves are born, they are surplus to requirements and farmers are currently faced with few options. They can immediately dispose of the calf, either by shooting it themselves or contracting a knackerman to do it [licensed slaughter business that will kill or collect dead farm animals]. They can sell the calf to be raised for veal or beef. Or they can sell the calf for live export. A few farms are experimenting with keeping the calves with the mothers for longer, but this is an expensive and rarely chosen option. Early disposal is known as the ‘dirty secret’ by farmers, and none relish it. But keeping the calf to sell on to be raised for beef or veal means the farmer will have to rear them for two to four weeks to a good enough weight to interest buyers, at a typical cost of around a day, with selling prices at market as low as This doesn’t include extra costs such as getting the calf to market, registering its birth or veterinary bills. In contrast, shooting the calf costs as little as including the cost of the knackerman who will incinerate the body, or in some cases send them to kennels to be turned into dog food. Calves shot on farm cannot enter the human food chain and farmers can only dispose of calves themselves if they have a licensed incinerator. Dairy farmers in the UK have been under extreme pressure to cut costs for the last two decades, with milk long used as a loss leader by supermarkets to draw shoppers into their stores. “Some farmers might do the maths and figure out after rearing, transport and time away from the farm it might not add up,” says Chris Dodds, from the Livestock Auctioneers’ Association (LAA). The estimated calves disposed on-farm represents of the male dairy calves born, according to the most recent figures from the dairy industry body AHDB. In the number had fallen to of male dairy calves born from a previous The exact numbers shot on farm is difficult to collate as farmers destroying calves within a few days of birth on farm do not need to register the birth - and neither does the company collecting and disposing of the animal. One dairy farmer, who asked to remain anonymous, explained to the Guardian that she could not find a market for her male calves. “This year we’re shooting the Jersey crosses, because we’ve not got the space or money to keep them. It doesn’t make me feel good. “We get the knackerman out to do it. I could never do it. I can’t even feed them if I know they are going to be dead in a few days.” She said the issue was still “kept under the carpet” by the wider food and farming industry and that consumer markets needed to be developed and farmers financially supported to rear the calves. Another farmer told the Guardian: “I shoot black and white bull calves [the Holstein Friesian breed that predominates the dairy sector in the UK], but am still not hardened to like doing it. We have too many calves here. The space available on the farm [an dairy herd] is only suitable for a maximum of The less calves I have the better for the overall farm. This is a business and it has to be financially viable to make it worthwhile.” A joint NGO, retailer, farming and government initiative to promote markets for bull calves, that closed in estimated more than was being lost from calves killed before realising their economic worth. Some farmers might do the maths and figure out after rearing, transport and time away from the farm it might not add up. Chris Dodds, from the Livestock Auctioneers’ Association (LAA) The alternatives to early disposal are not simple. Half a million calves used to be exported from dairy farms via ferries to the continent, which has a larger market for veal.But public protests and industry pressure against animals being sent on long journeys in lorries and lower animal welfare standards in other countries has seen that outlet largely disappear. No calves were exported from England last year, although an estimated calves did leave from Scotland and a further from Northern Ireland . Attempts to promote a market for high welfare British rosé veal, championed by the likes of Jamie Oliver and Jimmy Doherty, have met with mixed success with margins for farmers tight and consumer interest low. The RSPCA is calling for the food industry to be allowed to rename veal as rosé beef to end consumer misconception of it as a white meat produced from calves kept in crates and fed milk – a system that was banned in the UK in the early Another alternative is to rear the calves for longer and sell them as beef. One of the companies doing that is Buitelaar, set up in and which collected more than calves from dairy farms across the UK last year. It arranges for them to be reared indoors on a mixed diet and then sold after months through UK supermarkets, restaurants and fast food chains. But some breeds such as Jersey cows are not seen as suitable for this option. There has been a steady growth in the use and effectiveness of sexed semen since the early accounting for of total semen sales in It increases costs for farmers but can reduce the proportion of male calves being born to less than Supermarkets could play an important role in reforming the situation and providing a market for meat from bull calves. Tesco, Aldi, Iceland, Lidl, the Co-op and Asda do not ban their milk suppliers from shooting bull calves and it is not outlawed under organic standards . But some of the large chains – the Co-op , Morrisons , Sainsburys and Waitrose – have launched schemes, in conjunction with beef companies such as ABP, Buitelaar and Dunbia, to collect calves and ensure they are reared rather than destroyed. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) warns that post-Brexit trade deals could make it harder for farmers to find a market for male calves. “A trade deal that allows cheap beef from countries with lower standards of production will most definitely damage many of the positive initiatives that have been developed over recent years to utilise dairy bull calf beef and veal within the UK market,” said NFU dairy advisor Siân Davies. Animals farmed: join us for monthly updates A small number of dairy farmers are experimenting with trying to make more use of the bull calves. David Finlay, who runs Cream O’Galloway, one of the UK largest ethical dairy farms in southwest Scotland, keeps his male and female calves with their mothers for the first five months. The male calves are then reared separately before being sold to a veal producer at eight months. He loses a large proportion of the milk produced by the female cows, but says his use of a dual purpose breeds of cows (good for milk and meat) means he gains a better market price for the animals. “The message coming to farmers from their peers and the industry is still to chase litres at all costs. But if you are chasing milk there will be a cost in terms of bull calves.” Send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com",1336,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/26/dairy-dirty-secret-its-still-cheaper-to-kill-male-calves-than-to-rear-them
85,"Slick industry PR campaigns about antibiotics in food are muddying the water around a serious public health risk, say critics. Pharmaceutical and meat companies are using similar tactics to the cigarette industry, in an attempt to confuse consumers and hold off regulation, despite the fact that the rapidly growing risk of anti-microbial resistance is one of the biggest health risks of our time. It estimated that by million people might die a year because we have overused antibiotics. In one facebook ad entitled “How to survive as a working mom” a stressed woman has a baby on her lap and a phone under one ear. “Breathe,” the advert says. “Pour a glass of wine (if that your thing). Prepare your family the chicken. Whether the label says ‘no antibiotics’ or not, the meat and milk you buy is free of harmful residues from antibiotics.” The Enough Movement – the “global community” behind this advert – promises to tell you the truth about food. But it a PR campaign funded by Elanco, a multinational animal drugs company that sells antibiotics for use on livestock. Elanco operates in more than countries and in accounted for of the veterinary pharmaceuticals market. A subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company, last year it was valued at They’re trying to brush us off like we’re hysterical women who need a pat on the head and a glass of wine to calm down. Sarah Sorscher, Center for Science in the Public Interest Elanco, along with other organisations with vested interests, is using slick advertising campaigns to downplay consumer concerns over giving antibiotics to animals, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has found. Mothers are clearly the target for many of the Enough Movement adverts. Some – such as one titled “Eat. Sleep. Mom. Repeat” – make no reference to antibiotics or agriculture at all. Another from its Twitter feed reads: “Making mom friends can be difficult. Making food decisions doesn’t have to be. Whether the label says “no antibiotics” or not, the meat or milk you buy is free of harmful residues from antibiotics.” These adverts – just a handful of the many posted on social media by the Enough Movement – refer to Food Safety Inspection Service testing, which makes sure the meat on supermarket shelves has no more than trace amounts of antibiotic. But many scientists are more concerned about the rise of antimicrobial resistance - where bugs don’t respond to medicine - than about antibiotic residues. The heavy use of antibiotics on farms is believed to be a major contributor to this problem, seen as one of the most dangerous public health issues of our time. The Enough Movement potentially confuses consumers, who are increasingly looking for antibiotic-free meat, by shifting the debate from resistance to residues. Sarah Sorscher, Deputy Director of Regulatory Affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest said: “Ads like this are patronising. Industry should be looking for ways to address valid consumer concerns. Instead, they’re trying to brush us off like we’re a bunch of hysterical women who just need a pat on the head and a good glass of wine to calm down.” Besides the Elanco adverts’ tendency for being “grossly sexist”, says Dr Thomas Van Boeckel – an epidemiologist specialising in antimicrobial resistance – they are also “a classic strategy to divert the debate about residues rather than focusing on the core issue, which is the selection for resistant bacteria in the live animals due to the constant exposure to those drugs on the farm”. Scientists believe that using antibiotics on farm animals is one of the major causes of the growth of antimicrobial resistance. Any resistant bacteria that has thrived across a large herd of animals in close quarters can potentially spread from farms and infect humans through food, contact with farm workers or in soil and fertiliser. Drug resistance has been dubbed one of the greatest public health threats the world faces. It is estimated to kill people worldwide , a figure that will rise to million by if no action is taken. Ferd Hoefner, a senior strategic advisor at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, believes the way industry has responded to calls to reduce the amount of antibiotics in agriculture is strikingly similar to techniques adopted in the smoking and climate change fields: “PR companies … are just constantly raising doubts. They’ve turned that kind of thing into an art form.” Prof Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the US-based Center for Disease Dynamics Economics and Policy, agrees: “It not surprising. It pretty standard. In the case of tobacco the industry played down the effects of smoking – ‘a few cigarettes won’t hurt you’. They tried to appeal to women by making smoking Virginia Slims a sign of the feminist movement. “The truth is that companies like Elanco are likely to face significant financial hardship given that many of the world consumers will no longer want to buy meat raised on antibiotics.” In a report commissioned by the British government, former economist Lord Jim O’Neill found that out of academic studies – excluding those funded by industry or government bodies – supported evidence of a link between antibiotic consumption in animals and resistance in humans. Only argued that there was no link. Of the studies compiled by Lord O’Neill, the most recent academic paper to find no link was written by a student at a Hawaiian high school in Out of four industry-funded papers identified by the review, two didn’t support evidence that banning agricultural antibiotic use would have an effect on the level of resistance in humans. Even so, one of those industry-funded papers said stricter regulation of newer antibiotics in agriculture could potentially extend their effectiveness in humans. The authors of the study – which was funded by Pfizer, one of the world biggest drug companies, and published in – suggested that recently discovered antibiotics should be used prudently on farms before resistance emerges. But they argue that controlling the use of antibiotics in agriculture after resistance has already emerged will have little impact on the number of superbugs in hospitals. The Elanco-funded Enough Movement reads like a humanitarian report, offering “practical solutions” on ensuring there is enough food for everyone as the population grows. The ‘movement’, which includes a report, a website and social media adverts, promotes modern farming procedures that could ensure a steady supply of meat and dairy. The campaign Facebook page has more than followers and Elanco claims its messaging gains million impressions online per week. Animals farmed: join us for monthly updates In response to the Bureau findings, Elanco said: “The Enough Movement works to bring awareness to food security and answer consumer questions about how food is produced. Recent labelling initiatives have increased consumer questions about antibiotic use in animals. And we have a responsibility to answer those concerns, especially when it comes to the safety of the food we eat.” Sanderson Farms, the third largest poultry producer in the US, launched a similar campaign to Elanco in as its CEO called meat labelled as “antibiotic-free” as “misleading”. In one TV advert, a man in a supermarket, dressed in a plaid shirt, khakis and a cap, says: “Some chicken companies try to get you to spend more money by using labels like ‘raised without antibiotics’. At Sanderson Farms, we don’t believe in gimmicks like that. No antibiotics to worry about here.” Last month, a report by the investors’ group Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return ranked Sanderson Farms among the worst companies for its policies on antibiotic use in animals. Sanderson Farms did not respond to a request for comment, but a statement on its website says it is “committed to taking steps toward finding alternative ways to control disease to reduce antibiotic use, and to work with its drug suppliers to phase out the use of antibiotics that are important to human medicine when alternatives become available”. Although the majority of the scientific community accepts antibiotic use on farms is a genuine threat to human health, the true scale of the problem remains unknown. And this gap in knowledge has proved fertile ground for the agricultural and pharmaceutical industry to suggest the threat may be at most minimal. Not only are companies targeting consumers with adverts, the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries are also pumping money into scientific research on antibiotic resistance. Some of these studies either play down the potential risk to human health from antibiotic use in farm animals or support claims that more research is needed before policy decisions are made. Elanco has indirectly funded studies that point to the need for more research on the link between antibiotic use on farms and resistant infections in humans. Along with other major pharmaceutical companies, including Bayer Animal Health and Boehringer Ingelheim, it is one of members of the Animal Health Institute (AHI), which has funded this work. Eight out of the AHI members listed on its website sell antibiotics for use in farm animals. AHI also spent almost on lobbying between and according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A number of companies have fervently opposed stricter regulations arguing that, without antibiotics, not only will animal welfare be compromised but food prices will go up. Until antibiotics were widely used as growth promoters on US farms, helping livestock grow fatter more quickly. When farm animals are sick it is sometimes necessary to give them antibiotics. But US farmers are still allowed to routinely give them to healthy animals to prevent disease, a practice many believe can often take place as a way of dealing with overcrowding and poor hygiene. This so-called “prophylactic use” of antibiotics is currently being scrutinised in the EU, with stricter regulations under consideration. Dr James Rogers, director of Food Safety Research and Testing at Consumer Reports and a former FSIS employee, said: “There is intense pushback because we are talking about an economic effect, that if they were not allowed to use antibiotics, especially for growth promotion, you’re going to get fewer pounds per chicken, which means less money.” In November the US Department of Agriculture rejected further restrictions recommended by the World Health Organization. The guidelines proposed a ban on giving healthy animals antibiotics important for human medicine. The USDA acting chief scientist, Dr Chavonda Jacobs-Young said they were “not in alignment with US policy and not supported by sound science”. Hoefner, who is a regular attendee at the monthly meetings between industry representatives and USDA officials, described her comment as “outrageous” given the weight of knowledge behind the WHO guidelines. Last year agribusiness organisations, including all livestock, crop and tobacco industries, spent more than on lobbying in the US, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Critics say industry is perceived to have been able to tighten its grip on the USDA during the Trump administration, especially on the issue of antibiotic use. Hoefner said: “We were making some inroads in the last administration here in the US, but even then it was difficult. We weren’t making huge strides but we were making some strides. But now it totally impossible so we’ll just have to wait this out.” But Prof Laxminarayan is more hopeful. Referring to Elanco Enough Movement, he says: “I see all of this as the last cries before it goes down,” he said. “It will still have a role in animal health, but the days of pushing antibiotics in livestock for growth promotion, their widespread use on farms to prevent disease, are soon to be over.” How much does big pharma make from animal antibiotics?

86,"Thousands of British cattle reared for supermarket beef are being fattened in industrial-scale units where livestock have little or no access to pasture. Research by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has established that the UK is now home to a number of industrial-scale fattening units with herds of up to cattle at a time being held in grassless pens for extended periods rather than being grazed or barn-reared. Intensive beef farms, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are commonplace in the US . But the practice of intensive beef farming in the UK has not previously been widely acknowledged – and the findings have sparked the latest clash over the future of British farming. The beef industry says that the scale of operations involved enables farmers to rear cattle efficiently and profitably, and ensure high welfare standards. But critics say there are welfare and environmental concerns around this style of farming, and believe that the farms are evidence of a wider intensification of the UK livestock sector which is not being sufficiently debated, and which may have an impact on small farmers. In contrast to large intensive pig and poultry farms, industrial beef units do not require a government permit, and there are no official records held by DEFRA on how many intensive beef units are in operation. But the Guardian and the Bureau has identified nearly a dozen operating across England, including at sites in Kent, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The largest farms fatten up to cattle a year. Drone footage and satellite images reveal how thousands of cattle are being kept at some sites in outdoor pens, known as corrals, sometimes surrounded by walls, fences or straw bales. Although the cattle will have spent time grazing in fields prior to fattening, some will be confined in pens for around a quarter of their lives, until they are slaughtered. Supermarket demand is believed to be, at least in part, driving the trend. In addition, some smaller and medium-scale beef producers have struggled to farm profitably in recent years, with sometimes tight margins and fluctuating costs. Most of the units identified are believed to have grown incrementally, rather than setting up from scratch. A number of retailers, including the Co-op, Lidl and Waitrose, are among those found to be sourcing beef from UK intensive industrial scale farms, most of which are privately owned but sell to beef processing companies, which in turn supply retailers. Chris Mallon, director of the National Beef Association (NBA), the industry trade body, said the reason the largest units have come about was purely down to “efficiency”. Share your stories from inside the farming industry “What we’re talking about here is commercial production, for feeding people. It not niche market. A lot of this will be on supermarket shelves – that where it coming into its own. In the catering side as well, they’ll be doing it,” he said. “One of the things we’ve seen over the years is supermarket domination of the beef trade. What they want is specification, size of cuts, size to fit certain packaging, size of roasts – this has all become incredibly important.” But he cautioned that farms dedicated to fattening cattle had always been bigger than those rearing them, “so actually having higher concentration of feeding cattle on units [isn’t new]. “The difference is we’re getting some larger units now and that will be because of economies of scale … if you can give the people you’re supplying a constant supply of cattle that are in the right specification, that makes you more valuable. And that one of the reasons we’ve seen a move towards it.” Dr Jude Capper, a livestock expert who has studied intensive beef units in the US and elsewhere said that due to economies of scale “it almost inevitable that a larger farm can produce a greater quantity of a more affordable product – we see this in almost all agricultural sectors globally, just as we do in other industries”. The Guardian and Bureau last year revealed that poultry and pig “mega farms” or CAFOs have appeared in the British countryside in recent years, some housing more than a million chickens or about pigs. Following the revelations, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, pledged that Brexit would not be allowed to result in the spread of US-style agribusiness: “I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country, ” he said in a parliamentary statement. Although the number of beef units is tiny in comparison with intensive poultry or pig farms, the latest findings have further fuelled fears that the UK could be embracing industrial-scale practices. Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavillion, said the farms were “gravely concerning” and that “with Britain hurtling towards Brexit, and with our animal and environmental protections facing an uncertain future, I’m worried that we could end up adopting more of this US-style agricultural practice”. Richard Young, Policy Director at the Sustainable Food Trust, said: “Keeping large number of cattle together in intensive conditions removes all justification for rearing them and for consumers to eat red meat... More than two-thirds of UK farmland is under grass for sound environmental reasons and the major justifications for keeping cattle and eating red meat are that they produce high quality protein and healthy fats from land that is not suitable for growing crops.” Young added that that smaller scale beef farmers might feel the impact, as larger farms were likely to be “more efficient in purely economic terms”, allowing the supermarkets “to drive down the retail price of beef below the price at which more traditional farmers can produce it. As a result they go out of business.” The changing face of traditional UK beef production Beef production in the UK typically involves three distinct stages - calf rearing, growing and fattening - with many farms specialising in one part of the rearing process. Cattle may move between a number of different farms during their lifecycle. (A smaller number of farms rear cattle from birth and keep them on the same farm until being sent to the abattoir.) After spending time on pasture many cattle are moved to dedicated “finishing units” and are typically housed in barns or grazed whilst being fattened ahead of slaughter, often for around months. Many are fed specialist diets designed to encourage weight gain. But in the US, much beef fattening takes place in “feedlots” with cattle held in vast outdoor pens where the largest facilities confine up to livestock. Such “feedlots” have proved controversial in the past, both because of their size and because many cattle were given hormones and antibiotics, sometimes to encourage rapid growth. (Such practices are not permitted in the UK). Despite acknowledging the arrival of intensive beef farming in the UK, experts reject the notion that the British beef sector will see a wholesale shift towards farming on a US-scale. “Are we likely to see huge – head – feedlots? No. We don’t have the market, infrastructure or public demand for them,” said Capper. “However, could we make better use of male calves from dairy farms by rearing them for beef in feedlot-style operations, using feeds that we cannot [or] will not eat, such as by-products from human food crop production? Absolutely – some beef producers are already doing this.” Caroline Lucas called for the system of permits to be tightened up, and said “the Government should be officially recording the number of feedlots rather than letting reporting slip through a loophole … we need a proper debate in this country over what kind of agriculture we want in the future.” A spokesperson for DEFRA said that “beef farms are regulated in exactly the same way as any other farms”. But it later acknowledged that “Defra does not have a database of feedlot style units...The Cattle Tracing System can provide figures on the number of holdings split by premised type e.g. Agricultural Holding, Slaughterhouse, Market etc. and the number of animals registered to each. However, it does not hold any data in respect of the feeding practices on the holdings.” Waitrose said of its own supplier: “Animal welfare is of the highest importance to us and a large farm does not equal poor animal welfare standards. The farm is run under a bespoke environmental management plan in conjunction with Natural England. All the cattle graze the marshes during the summer season then during the winter months, when the grass is dormant the cattle are bought back to the yard when the finishing/fattening cattle are housed in covered sheds. For clarification the length of grazing season is weather dependent, once the grass stops growing the cattle need to be yarded and fed a forage based ration in accordance with animal welfare and best practice.” A spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium said: “Our members take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously and work closely with trusted suppliers so that high welfare standards are upheld. They have strict processes in place and will thoroughly investigate any evidence of non-conformity to ensure that any problems are immediately addressed.” The Guardian approached several of the largest units but all declined to comment. Some in the beef industry itself have expressed unease about the intensive farming system. Russ Carrington, of the Pasture Fed Livestock Association, said: “It is sad that the travel towards cheap, de-valued food has led to the removal of livestock from fields. There is a very different, more sustainable way of producing high quality beef which is also considerably healthier for humans to eat – grass-fed and grain-free, which has lower total and saturated fat content, a better ratio of omega to omega fatty acids and more vitamins and minerals, which comes from the diverse pasture they eat.” Pressure group Compassion In World Farming (CIWF) have raised concerns that some cattle held at in “feedlots” are kept in “high stocking densities” with little or no shelter or shade and “no dry ground to rest on.” The group says it believes “cows belong on pasture”. In response Dr Jude Capper said: “In my experience at feedlots all over the world, I’ve yet to see any welfare issues that are inherent to the system. If we are to assume that cattle must be able to graze to lead a ‘happy’ life, then confinement may be regarded as an issue. However, I’ve yet to see this being backed by [any evidence-base].” Evidence compiled by the Bureau and Guardian suggests that most intensive beef farms appear to operate to high welfare standards. Chris Mallon said: “Cattle actually will be very happy in [these systems]. Cattle in the wild don’t build nests for themselves or hide in caves, they’re an outdoor animal and I think we’ve got to remember that.”",1802,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/29/revealed-industrial-scale-beef-farming-comes-to-the-uk
87,"Farm antibiotic use rarely features on food labels or marketing in the UK, so it very hard for shoppers to know how to support farmers who are using less. For whole meat and butchered cuts, there are some rules of thumb for the conscious shopper: Buy British – overall, British farmers are making reasonable progress on reducing antibiotic use. (Although more so in beef, dairy, chicken and eggs and slightly less so in pork. The two countries from which the UK imports the most pig meat – Denmark and the Netherlands – use only about a third of the British antibiotic use per head.) Buy higher welfare – animals reared in healthier conditions tend to be more naturally resistant to disease, so are less likely to need medication – look for free-range, RSPCAassured, pasture-fed and certified organic Buy organic – this is the only certified system that explicitly limits farm antibiotic use and requires farmers to use other methods to prevent and treat disease Be careful of “antibiotic-free” claims. Some animals need to be treated with antibiotics and there may be welfare issues – find out more about the farm. However, many of us don’t buy meat in its whole form, nor in butchered cuts. Much of the meat eaten in this country is served to us by somebody else. With minimal provenance information appearing on most menus, it is almost impossible for a consumer to judge the antibiotics status of the meat in their curry, ready meal, pub lunch, hospital meal or school dinner. The best you can do is to look for higher welfare and organic and to say that you are concerned. Some larger catering companies, restaurant chains and wholesalers might be prepared to adopt a policy. You could also ask smaller food outlets if they have an antibiotics policy – though realistically, farm antibiotics awareness is likely to be very low. Encourage them to get involved in a group looking at such issues, such as the Sustainable Restaurant Association. With limited opportunity for shoppers to buy antibiotics-friendly meat, dairy and eggs, probably the most important thing that we can all do is to make our voices heard – especially with those in the position to make change happen at scale. If you’re concerned about farm antibiotic use, then please consider the following. Tell your supermarket you want them to get their meat, dairy and egg suppliers – British and overseas – to ban “prophylactic” (just-in-case) antibiotic use, to reduce their antibiotic use overall, and routinely to provide data on progress. Ask your supermarket routinely to publish data on antibiotic across their meat, dairy and egg supply chains, as Asda, M&amp;S, Waitrose and the Co-op have already done. Tell them you want them to participate in a national and healthy “race to the top” on phasing out profligate use of farm antibiotics. Participate in action to let UK trade secretary Liam Fox and UK agriculture secretary Michael Gove know that they must consider protection of antibiotics when they negotiate international trade deals. Some countries use farm antibiotics at many times the level of British farmers, for example five times as much in the US. Trade deals for antibiotic-intensive cheap meat risk undermining the good work of British farmers.

88,"range tip butterflies jink over grassland and a buzzard mews high on a thermal. Blackthorns burst with bridal white blossom and sallow leaves of peppermint green unfurl. The exhilaration in this corner of West Sussex is not, however, simply the thrilling explosion of spring. The land is bursting with an unusual abundance of life; rampant weeds and wild flowers, insects, birdsong, ancient trees and enormous hedgerows, billowing into fields of hawthorn. And some of the conventional words from three millennia of farming – ‘hedgerow’, ‘field’ and ‘weed’ – no longer seem to apply in a landscape which is utterly alien to anyone raised in an intensively farmed environment. This is Knepp, a farm in densely-populated lowland Britain, barely miles from London. Once a conventional dairy and arable operation, at the turn of this century, Knepp owners, Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree, auctioned off their farm machinery, rewilded their land and, as much by accident as design, inched towards a new model of farming. Some view the result as an immoral eyesore, an abnegation of our responsibility to keep land productive and tidy. Others find it inspiring proof that people and other nature can coexist. A pair of storks circle in the spring sky, great white egrets stalk the waterways and violet dor beetles – previously unseen in Sussex for years – mine the cowpats on the front lawn of Burrell and Tree historic, castellated home. The farm employs a full-time ecologist rather than farm labourers these days. Its advisory board of ecologists and other conservationists help analyse the rapid changes to their land and its animals. These changes are almost always uplifting. They used a drone for the first time to count grey heron nests this year and found rather than the of last year. This wild nature helps Burrell and Tree have a thriving glamping site and ecotourism business but they are still producing food from their free-roaming, “rewilded” livestock. “It just like ranching really,” says Tree. She has just written a book, Wilding , which tells the story of the Knepp transformation, and their own personal transformation too. She met Burrell through mutual school friends when she was he attended agricultural college and then, aged inherited the Knepp estate in His family have farmed this land since it was a medieval deer park but what sounds like an archetypically privileged aristocratic tale is a little more complicated. Burrell inherited the estate from his grandparents, just after the twin blows of the hurricane that destroyed millions of trees in southern England and the Black Monday stock market crash. The farm is on the famously heavy clays of the Sussex Weald. It no coincidence that Sussex folk have more than dialect words for mud, from clodgy to gubber: this poorly draining “marginal” soil sets like concrete in summer and porridge in winter, and will never provide high yields of crops. For years, Burrell did what the conventional farming world told him to do: intensify, and diversify. Tree quotes Burrell aunt: “We were all brought up to believe we would go to heaven if we made two blades of grass grow where one had grown before.” They invested in better machinery, unleashed the latest pesticides and launched their own brand ice-cream. They almost doubled their wheat yields. It didn’t work. After years of farming, they made a cash surplus in only two. Both Burrell and Tree enjoyed wildlife. “We’d go all over the world looking for nature, never thinking about what we were doing to it here, or how it could be here,” says Tree. In the ancient oaks on their land were inspected by an expert, Ted Green. He told the couple that their trees were in poor health because of their farming system ploughing of roots and the destruction of mycorrhizae, a vast subterranean fungal network that is crucial to plant health. His visit, writes Tree, coming just when they realised their farm business was unequivocally failing, was an epiphany. Country diary: wilding calls to the turtle dove Nearly two decades on, Knepp is a completely different farm to its neighbours. In fact, after two decades, it is still unique: the only sizeable farm in lowland Britain to rewild itself. Its land is no longer a place of conventional food production. Arable fields have been left to run wild and the way animals and plants have bounced back has been constantly surprising, and rapid. Taking their lead from Dutch ecologist Frans Vera, Burrell and Tree have introduced free-roaming herbivores to mimic the grazing of extinct animals such as aurochs and tarpans. They “farm” head of English longhorn cattle cows and their youngsters), Tamworth pigs, red and fallow deer and Exmoor ponies. Knepp challenges agricultural conventions but also tears up the orthodox conservation rulebook. Rather than set targets to protect specific rare species, their principle is to allow “natural processes” to unfold. So there are no internal fences, and no predator control – to say, stop foxes predating ground-nesting lapwing (a declining bird in Britain) – and no “scrub-bashing” so favoured by conventional conservationists. The uniqueness of Knepp poses three questions. Why did Burrell and Tree do it? Why has no-one else in Britain done it yet? And can Knepp success be replicated elsewhere? Tree believes the answer to the first question is their unusual personal situation. They both acknowledge their good fortune: Burrell is not a tenant farmer but inherited the estate from his grandparents. Because Burrell was so young when he took over, when he realised conventional farming was failing he was still young and energetic enough to try something different. “Naivety,” laughs Burrell. Unlike many young farmers, because Knepp skipped a generation, he was also not burdened by farmer parents criticising change: intergenerational dynamics are a huge influence on how farmers farm. Tree also believes that because Burrell spent his childhood in Africa and the Australian bush he was familiar with Serengeti-type landscapes, and a vision of free-roaming animals was not an anathema. Many might assume Knepp has not been adopted by other British farms because it cannot be financially viable for anyone but the wealthiest of farmers. “We’re always going to get this criticism levelled at us – ‘It alright for you, you live in a castle and you went to public school,’” says Tree. Tenant farmers or farmers with massive mortgages might not be able to start a Knepp (although Knepp was overdrawn when it changed its farming model) but this is not a self-indulgent hobby. Knepp economics are striking. The farm today makes a annual profit from one field – one-third of the average annual income its entire conventional farm of mixed crops, beef, sheep and dairy cows used to make. “That bloody mad,” says Burrell. This magic field is worthless in agricultural terms but sits in a scenic valley surrounded by ancient trees and rewilding excitement, and now features yurts and an outdoor bath for glampers. In their previous incarnation as an intensive farm, Knepp may have averaged a year profit but lost money in all but two years because of endless capital investments in new machinery, such as dairy technology or new slurry lagoons or sewage systems to adhere to new legislation. A wilded farm has much fewer capital demands. Apart from glamping turnover (not profit) in annual farm incomes totalled from selling tonnes of live weight high-grade organic meat, from renting former farm buildings to local businesses (attracting full-time jobs to the local economy), and from renting seven former workers’ cottages. As Burrell and Tree accept, such lucrative income streams are not available to every farmer; Knepp benefits from its proximity to Brighton and London. Finally, the farm currently receives for having its land in the highest level of environmental stewardship scheme and in “basic payments” which every British farmer receives via EU funds. As all British farmers know, Brexit is certain to see the end of such generous subsidies. It may not look like farming but Knepp animal husbandry is subtle and complex. Conventional beef cattle reared on silage and grain are slaughtered at months; Knepp free-range cows are months old. (If they are slaughtered over months they are priced less because of old regulations from the BSE health scare.) So in farming terms, “we’re losing four months from a conventional system,” explains Burrell, “but we’ve not had to put any imputs into growing the animals – we’re not making silage, growing wheat, housing them, getting rid of the dung, treating them with antibiotics. We have none of the costs associated with the production.” The farm sole conventional employee is its stockman, Pat Toe. The animals roam wild but cows still need to be periodically rounded up for TB tests and for slaughter – not easy when they are hiding in Knepp burgeoning sallow thickets. “Just checking is a massive part of it,” says Toe. “This kind of system doesn’t take much labour but the labour is pretty intense sometimes.” When he arrived years ago, he rounded up the cows on quad bikes. “It as near to chasing them as it could be and we just thought ‘no’ - it dangerous, and it not good for the animals. There were seven of us and we still wouldn’t get them all in.” So Toe watched long and rather tedious videos of American “cow whisperer” Bud Williams, who teaches ranchers how to round up cows simply by walking them. “There no running, no hitting with sticks,” says Toe. Instead, subtle movements help start the process, and each herd gathers its members together on its perambulation through unfenced former fields. Much of Toe job is observing animals, assessing their condition, and making sure Knepp stock density is just right for the natural food available. While the farm wants to allow “natural” environmental processes to unfold, if they let livestock populations grow too high, the animals will starve in the winter. The land will also suffer – grassy fields become muddy and “poached” while trees are eaten and destroyed. At first, Burrell and Tree worried that there wouldn’t be enough grass for the animals over winter because “weeds” such as fleabane ran rampant in the early years of rewilding. But they discovered how nature is usually self-regulating and weeds, and species that devour them, boom and bust. Also, watching “wild” cows has been a revelation. “What extraordinary when you allow animals free reign in the landscape is that you suddenly see their behaviours,” says Tree. “They are endlessly surprising.” The biggest surprise has been to discover the pigs dive into waterways to collect swan mussels to eat. Tree is also amazed by the amount of sustenance that cows browse from trees and hedges, particularly in winter. Each February a vet observes the cow condition. In they had to reduce their cows in their northern section by because the herd had rapidly grown too large. If winters are hard, the vets help determine if animals require supplementary feeding. “Natural” starvation isn’t permitted; animals must be slaughtered well before that point. “The key concern, as farmers, is to ensure [herd] numbers are always low enough so that, even in the harshest or wettest winter, the animals can come through it in good condition,” says Tree. Surprisingly, perhaps, even after the latest unusually wet and cold winter, their animals did not require any supplementary feed. Tree has seen what organic farmer Rosamund Young has observed in her book, The Secret Life of Cows: free-ranging animals will “self-medicate” with certain plants if they are poorly, and find alternatives when there no grass growing. While Knepp organic meat already has a premium price, Tree believes the basic “organic” label is underselling it. “Nobody knows that it free-roaming, self-medicating, conservation project rewilding meat. It as ethical a meat as you can get. It doing the least possible damage to the animal, it positively good for the environment and it positively good for us nutritionally because it entirely pasture-fed,” she argues. Tree hopes they can create their own brand and sell more meat direct to consumers. Vegetarian campsite guests “will actually eat our meat because all their objections are invalid when they see what we are doing,” says Tree. “Our daughter will eat our meat but she won’t eat dairy.” Knepp is attracting the attention of both farmers and environmentalists, and Tree new book must be unique in receiving glowing endorsements from both George Monbiot, the bete noir of sheep farmers, and James Rebanks, the sheep farmer and author who defends the cultural value of upland farming. Both have visited Knepp. And yet the farm also attracts criticism from all sides too – farmers, traditional conservationists and rewilding purists, who dismiss Knepp as insignificant “rewilding-lite” with its fenced enclosures and absence of apex predators such as wolves. Meanwhile, some traditional conservationists have suggested that Knepp is already “overgrazed”, albeit in a less extreme way than Oostvaardersplassen , the rewilded nature reserve in the Netherlands where herbivores roam free with minimal intervention. How much livestock can Knepp land carry? “We’ve got no preconceived idea,” says Burrell. A conventional farm may put five, six or seven “Grazing Livestock Units” (one modern dairy cow; a lowland ewe is livestock units) on each hectare. “Conservation grazing” according to Natural England, the government conservation watchdog, should be no more than livestock units per hectare. Knepp graze much less than conventional farms, and much less than conservationists too – just livestock units per hectare. Burrell has long discussions with Knepp advisory board about “overgrazing” in certain areas of Knepp. “It always used as a derogatory term, rather than ‘highly grazed’ or ‘tightly grazed’. Ok, overgrazed – for what? Dor beetles love tightly grazed ‘lawns’ but Essex Skippers [butterflies which require long grass] don’t. If you are a botanist and want more flowers you’d say it was overgrazed. The carrying capacity of the land is often much higher than one might think because we’re unused to seeing it.” Of the charge that Knepp is not “proper” rewilding, Burrell and Tree never claim that they are. They can’t bring back wild boar which, despite populations re-establishing themselves in the Forest of Dean and elsewhere, are classified as dangerous wild animals in law. They can’t even put a stallion among their Exmoor ponies for fear of scaring the horses that are ridden on public byways through Knepp. “We’re not a big area. we’re not a national park, we’re not a wilderness, we haven’t got apex predators,” says Tree, “but we can still do something really interesting by introducing drivers of change [herbivores] and then letting go.” They would like to introduce more but Burrell even found an innocuous-sounding plan to reintroduce storks was thwarted when some members of Sussex Wildlife Trust opposed the scheme. Knepp has gone ahead and brought in storks anyway, and next hopes to bring back the beaver. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has approved schemes releasing beavers into fenced enclosures to alleviate flooding and benefit biodiversity but beavers are still controversial with many farmers. While conservationists endlessly debate such issues, Burrell and Tree, like all farmers, are ultimately doers. “Of course you want to carry popular opinion with you but when you can see something in the flesh it often more powerful than the analytical argument,” says Burrell. “As soon as you see them [storks or beavers] you think, actually, it fine.” To return to the question of whether more British farmers will follow Knepp, landscape change and new species are “scary” says Tree. “People come here the whole time and think, ‘how amazing’ but going back and doing it in your own backyard is a different thing. If a landowner is in a position like us, quite often they have parents who are still alive who think it appalling. Partly it fear of what the neighbours think. People really mind being criticised. Even just leaving dead wood on the ground, people say, ‘It so untidy’. If we’ve grown up having a happy childhood roaming barren hills, seeing it scrub up is very difficult. It challenging an aesthetic. Once it happens, you learn to love it but it making that leap. So many farmers are on the cusp of doing this. It just a little incentive – whether that removing the subsidies, or being paid for some ecosystem services to make something a bit wilder.” Burrell and Tree firmly believe their model is applicable to other farms, and smaller farms too, but it will depend on whether society is willing to pay for “ecosystem services” such as unpolluted water, flood protection and restored soils provided by truly sustainable farming. In Britain, it will also depend on what sort of farm payments post-Brexit Britain decides it can afford. Environment Secretary Michael Gove mantra is “public money for public goods”, suggesting farmers will be rewarded for supporting ecosystem services. Some predict that marginal agricultural land will become “environmental” land while fertile lowland areas will be ever more intensively farmed. But Burrell and Tree hope this vision doesn’t come to pass in Britain. “There has to be nature put back into landscapes which are fertile farming land – it can’t just be the marginal land that gets turned back to nature,” says Burrell. As Tree puts it: “To expect people living in good agricultural land to have no access to nature – everybody should have access to nature.” Burrell understands that farmers are sometimes reluctant to embrace wildlife-friendly farming because they fear that regulators will then step in to protect that wildlife. “This has always been aimed at me by farmers – ‘If you turn your land into something good for nature, they’ll screw you. They will stop you ever farming again,’” says Burrell. So his big idea is “pop-up Knepps” with government regulation to support farmers devoting land to wildlife as Knepp as done for a limited period of years. After this period, the restored soil can be turned back to agriculture if required, and the wildlife that has made the area its home can move to another pop-up rewilding project nearby. It a super-scale, long-term rotational farming system for nature. Burrell and Tree won’t turn their land back to conventional farming, and Burrell guesses his children won’t either, but he pragmatic enough to recognise that some farmers might need to, and it needn’t be bad for nature if there replacement land nearby. Perhaps our static conceptions of landscape, farming and nature reserves are outmoded? Burrell is also interested in GPS fencing – using GPS collars on livestock to create virtual fencing, which graziers in America, France and Norway are already trialling. These could exclude livestock from certain areas for certain periods, mimicking the behaviour of apex predators. Burrell and Tree know wolves won’t be returned to southern Britain any time soon. “We need to rebuild ecosystems so that future generations will be able to choose whether they want to bring back wolves and bears,” says Tree. “The rewilding word is useful shorthand for the layperson – you can say ‘rewilding’ and people have an idea but it means so many things to so many different people. But unlike that little suffix, ‘re’, we’re not trying to go back. The world is so changed we can’t possibly ever go back to the past, if we could even understand what that was. We want to get some dynamism back into the landscape, because that where you get all the knock-on effects like soil restoration and water purification. What does seem to be true is that herbivores can kickstart dynamism into the system again, and lift the glider into the sky. Whether it cows or beavers, something exciting happens when you get free-roaming herbivores in the landscape again.” Wilding by Isabella Tree is published by Picador Animals farmed Agriculture Wildlife Conservation Birds features",3292,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/15/the-magical-wilderness-farm-raising-cows-among-the-weeds-at-knepp
89,"igh in the hills of Fuzhou, surrounded by acres of rustling bamboo, is a small farm that is pioneering something genuinely unusual in China . Here in Fujian province, they have turned their backs on industrial farming in favour of natural methods. After years of working in the industrial farming sector Mr Sun (not his real name – he asked to remain anonymous) wanted to create a space to raise animals with “respect for nature, respect for life”. He dreams of producing high-quality, organic crops – honey, eggs, pork, goose, chicken and fish – and creating a platform on which people can share knowledge and ideas around natural farming practices. Covering just acres and run by agricultural students, the farm eschews antibiotics and its pigs and chicken get plenty of exercise. Animals farmed: join us for monthly updates Sun was inspired in part by his profound concern about the rising number of antibiotics and growth hormones being fed to animals on Chinese farms. “Last century people decided that they didn’t want fatty meat, they wanted leaner meat, so factories started producing ractopamine to make the animals muscular,” he told the Guardian. “Then it got banned and they stopped. Consumers do impact [the decisions] of the factories.” Right now, China is the world largest consumer of agricultural antibiotics, out-dosing even the US by eight tonnes to every one. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that tons of antibiotics are consumed in China each year, with going to animal husbandry. In the US, of antibiotics amounting to tons are consumed by livestock each year. At another, very different farm nearby, Mr Zhang (not his real name) rears pork on a larger scale using methods more typical of intensive farming. Animals are reared in indoor pens in much closer proximity on a diet of factory-made meal. With pigs on site, the air in the pig sheds is stifling. Zhang farm is part of a chain that specialises in “ecological agriculture” and prides itself on its environmental approach to raising, slaughtering and processing meat. On its website, it states a commitment to “safety, health and deliciousness”, and a “customer-first” approach. “Here we give pigs antibiotics twice in their lifetime, whether they are sick or not. Once when they come out of nursery, and once when they are adult. We try to avoid putting the antibiotics in the feed but many farmers do, it very common,” he says. Animal antibiotics: Calm down about your chicken, says big pharma Zhang estimates it costs about yuan on average to raise a lean hog to adulthood, with medicine accounting for of the total bill. We learn from the vet that the antibiotics used by other local farmers include amoxicillin, tilmicosin and florfenicol, which are added to feed, whereas chloramphenicol, which is used on humans to treat ear and eye infections, is injected. Chlortetracycline, used to treat skin ailments on pigs – and on people – and cephalosporin are used, too. “Nowadays everyone uses antibiotics. Profit is motivating the whole thing. Using antibiotics is a precaution against loss of pigs. A mortality rate of is considered acceptable. But there are certain super bacteria that cannot be stopped. For farmers, they are cutting out the risk,” he explains. China at risk But a global alarm has been sounded about antibiotic prescription on farms following the rise of anti-microbial resistance. A growing number of bacteria that are resistant to some of our most important antibiotics are now leaving humans exposed to serious and previously curable illnesses . The heavy use of antibiotics on farms is believed to be a significant factor in the rapid growth of anti-microbial resistance (AMR). In fact it was in China that one of the biggest red flags on anti-microbial resistance went up for scientists, when a bacterium resistant to colistin, a so-called “last in line” drug, was detected in Microbiologist Tim Walsh, one of the report authors, describes the discovery as “the Holy Grail moment” in this field of science. Discussions led to the Chinese government swiftly banning the use of the drug in agriculture. Share your stories from inside the farming industry “Forecasts predict that by the big poultry producers in the world will be China and India. Knowing what we now know there has to be a complete revising of how we globally manage our food systems,” Walsh says. In Fudan University school of public health tested the urine of schoolchildren aged in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and found that in of samples at least one antibiotic was found, with two found in of the samples. It detected drugs, such as tylosin and enrofloxacin, that are only licensed for use on farmed animals. The study found evidence that exposure to antibiotics in childhood can raise the risk of obesity by threefold. What the law says For many years Chinese farmers have been able to buy and use antibiotics without the need for any prescription. “The Chinese government is shortening the list of antibiotics approved for animal use,” according to Wanqing Zhou, an associate of environmental NGO Brighter Green. “However, it has been and is still the case that the farmers can obtain and use antibiotics without a prescription.” China government is now trying to crack down on medicating healthy farm animals (a practice known as metaphylaxis). After all, China has a lot at stake. It currently produces half of the world pork , and chicken and beef farming are also on the rise, albeit more slowly. In its drive to feed the population, and allow them the access to cheap meat that the west already enjoys, it has embraced the industrial farming model pioneered by the US. The government has committed to addressing AMR. It is one of signatories to the UN “One Health” agenda. The former Ministry of Agriculture has made three recommendations to tackle the issue: the gradual phase-out of certain types of antibiotics critical to treating humans; tightening regulation to ensure some drugs are legal only with prescription; and improved monitoring of drug usage. Campaign group Greenpeace Asia says this does not go far enough and is calling for an immediate ban of the use of drugs critical to humans, and the phase-out of antibiotic use as a growth hormone (already banned in several countries). It advocates the promotion of alternative methods for promoting animal health, such as free-range farming and the use of natural herbs and medicines to treat sickness. But convincing farmers to stop using the antibiotics, which are heavily promoted by drugs companies, will not be easy. “The government has realised the public health risks and is trying to gradually reduce antibiotic use in the livestock industry,” says Wanqing, “but given the sheer amount of medium-sized animal farms, law enforcement will remain extremely challenging and any progress is expected to take place rather slowly.” “Even though some growth hormones have been banned, farmers still continue to use them. They hide it from inspection authorities when they come around to check their books,” says Zhang. On his small patch of green, Sun believes the government will tackle the problem quickly, but is realistic about the future. “The government is monitoring this situation closely. They need to let farmers know about the dangers of overdosing. They need to provide examples. They have already set up training courses and put up posters and created new certifications. Implementation and monitoring will be the biggest challenge.” “To recognise the truth is very important to consumers. I am optimistic. This [surveying the farmland around him] is not the final solution. This is my personal utopia.” Charlotte Middlehurst is an environmental journalist specializing on China and international climate policy How much do pharmaceutical companies make from animal antibiotics?

90,"he locals call this area the Ryaba-land. That the name of the chicken brand Nasha Ryaba under which MHP – the largest poultry company in Ukraine and the owners of Vinnytsia farm - sells poultry meat in supermarkets. There are more chicken sheds than houses here. Even the village signs bear the MHP brand. There are, as is so often the case, tensions between the industrial farms and the villagers. But in this case, anger is focussed not just on the company, but on their funders – the big international development banks that hand out public money. Earlier this month residents of three of the villages – Zaozerne, Kleban and Olyanytsya – filed a complaint to two of the world largest development banks, protesting against the development of the giant poultry farms which they say have profoundly affected their health, their water, and their homes. The International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have, between them, lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Ukraine largest poultry producer Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP). In it had received at least since MHP is mainly owned and run by Yuriy Kosiuk, who is a former deputy presidential chief of staff. Their flagship farm, Vinnytsia Poultry Farm (described on their website as the largest poultry producer in Europe ), now houses over million chickens. It plans to double its production by . But according to the villagers who have filed the complaint, the farm is a source of misery, leading to heavy traffic that is damaging houses, and unpleasant smells. The villagers say water levels in their wells have fallen, and that they worry about the quality of the river water. They say they are concerned about the pesticides being sprayed on fields of grain for the chickens, and claim that there have been threats of violence against anyone who complains about the company. And meanwhile, they add, a forest that the company promised to plant around the site has never materialised. And now the poultry farm has almost completed the construction of another poultry unit – a set of chicken houses, which hosts almost million chickens – near Zaozerne village. Some of the villagers have organised petitions against the new construction, organised pickets, sued the company in court and even traveled to Kyiv and met with President Petro Poroshenko chief of staff Ihor Rainin in Nothing has helped. “We want to live a normal life, not to be poisoned like cockroaches here,” says Oksana Bazyliuk from Zaozerne village. “A big problem here is that the information that being disclosed by the company about its local operations and the impacts they will have and the impacts they are already having has been really lacking,” says Caitlin Daniel, attorney of the Global Communities programme at Accountability Counsel, an international non-profit organisation that is helping farmers with filing the complaint. “And it has lead to a lot of fear among the local people and a lot of questions that haven’t been answered.” But there is also enormous concern about the fact that public money is funding these kind of industrial farming ventures. “I’m concerned about the fact that international financial institutions, acting under development mandates, are supporting this type of business in Ukraine,” said Xavier Sol, director of Counter Balance, a coalition of European NGOs monitoring international investment banks. “There are various problems linked to the project, from the company refusal to engage in an open dialogue with the local population (and its lack of transparency and accountability) to environmental and social impacts of the project.” MHP told the Guardian that they make sure that any particularly heavy trucks do not go through the village, and also says that it is currently building new roads. “We have no relation to the disappearance of water in the wells, because we do not use water at all from the wells for the production needs of the poultry factory. Water is taken exclusively from the South Buh River. In addition, the plant operates cleaning facilities, so water is returned from the river in better quality than it was when we extracted it. Our attitude towards the environment and the health of residents is unequivocally serious and responsible.” In relation to the promised forest they said: “Unfortunately, we can not plant the forest on agricultural lands, this is prohibited by the legislation of Ukraine. Representatives of the company that communicate with communities in the Vinnytsia region have repeatedly provided explanations on this issue.” They added that “the company is in constant dialogue with the communities through public hearings, anonymous forms of appeals, and so on”. The Guardian contacted the International Finance Corporation but they were unable to comment. Anton Usov at EBRD said the bank has had two investment projects with MHP since which have “no relation to the current complaint”. But he added that since EBRA started work with MHP, the company has improved its dialogue with the local communities with the assistance of the EBRD specialists. “We were not just giving money for some operations, we made the company totally revise its social and environmental procedures,” Usov said. Back in the village, though, many of the worried residents say they are afraid to give their names to the Guardian. “The foreign institution is our last hope,” one local activist said.",892,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/23/living-next-door-to-17-million-chickens-we-want-a-normal-life
91,"wo poles that once hoisted a clothes line stand rusting and unused in Elsie Herring back garden in eastern North Carolina. Herring lives next door to a field where pig manure is sprayed and the drifting faecal matter wasn’t kind to her drying clothes. “The clothes would stink so you’d wash them again and again until they fell apart,” said Herring, whose family has lived in Wallace since her grandfather, a freed slave, purchased land in the “You stand outside and it feels like it raining but then you realise it isn’t rain. It animal waste. It takes your breath away. You start gagging, coughing, your pulse increases. All you can do is run for cover.” For years here in North Carolina - the second largest pork-producing state in the US - the pigs have been outstripping the humans. They currently number around to one in Duplin county, with the impact, say local groups, falling disproportionately heavily on African-Americans, Latinos and native Americans. But in the last few weeks, two court decisions may have tipped momentum in a new direction, awarding compensation and bringing in new penalties for polluters. The pig farms of North Carolina produce around gallons of faeces a year, which is more than the volume of waste flushed down toilets by the human population of Germany. The waste falls underneath slatted floorboards and is discharged into murky lagoons that sit beside the barns. There are around of these cesspools in North Carolina. The sludge is broken down and sprayedonto nearby fields. In order to prevent ammonia washing off into water systems, the liquid is sprayed on crops that can, farmers say, soak up a lot of nutrients, such as Bermuda grass. Still, some residents, like Herring, have drinking water wells they’ve had to seal up. State regulators and the pork industry insist that a rigorous system of permits and inspections ensure that this waste doesn’t spill from lagoons into waterways, or drift in a sprayed mist onto nearby residents. A miasma of “offensive and sustained swine manure odors” lingers around the homes. Report, Shane Rogers, former EPA engineer But in April, a jury in Raleigh awarded in damages to neighbours of the Kinlaw farm in Bladen county, which has three waste lagoons. And that case is just the first in a series of similar claims against various hog operations in North Carolina, with the next to start on May. A study of several of the plaintiffs’ homes by Shane Rogers, a former Environmental Protection Agency engineer, found widespread evidence of pig faecal matter on walls, mailboxes and street signs. A miasma of “offensive and sustained swine manure odours” lingers around the homes, Rogers wrote. “Things are changing in North Carolina, we’re moving in the right direction for the first time in a while,” said Rick Dove, senior adviser at Waterkeeper Alliance, who has campaigned against the hog facilities for years. “The industry has the choice to either put in proper technology to treat the waste or shut down. If these judgments keep coming in they will face the situation the tobacco industry did and hopefully they don’t want that.” The complaints are targeted at pork producer Murphy-Brown, a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods (owned by Chinese conglomerate WH Group), rather than the individual contracted farmers who are nominally responsible for waste management. Smithfield called the lawsuits “an outrageous attack on animal agriculture, rural North Carolina and thousands of independent family farmers who own and operate contract farms.” It is appealing the Kinlaw case and said it won’t consider settling the remaining litigation until the appeal is decided. “Anything white people don’t want, they dump on eastern North Carolina.” Naemma Muhammad, North Carolina Environmental Justice Network But this opening victory for the anti-hog farm group was swiftly followed by another breakthrough. A civil rights complaint alleging that African Americans, such as Herring, as well as Latinos and native Americans are disproportionately burdened by “grossly inadequate and outdated systems of controlling animal waste” was settled with the state, which agreed to a new regime of water and air monitoring, along with a rejigged system of penalties for polluters. A study by the University of North Carolina has found that black people and native Americans are around twice as likely to live within three miles of an industrial hog operation than whites. “Anything white people don’t want, they dump on eastern North Carolina,” said Naeema Muhammad, co-director of North Carolina Environmental Justice Network. “It a new thing every day, this crap don’t ever stop. But someone is finally holding this industry accountable for the damage it has done.” But on the other side of the battle, the families who raise the pigs are nonplussed by this view of an industry they still consider rooted in family farming. Thomas (who also works in construction) and Sharon King (a dialysis nurse) raise hogs for Smithfield and hope to pass their hog operation onto one of their four children. “Farming is a way of life I’ve always known, tobacco used to be the money maker but it not now,” Sharon said. “We want our children to know something else than punching a time clock. We feed the world. Bacon comes from people like us and a lot of work goes into getting it onto the shelf. People forget that.” The Kings have a long tunnel-like barn containing around hogs near Wallace. The pigs mill around, occasionally drinking water from metal tubes that dangle into their pens. An automated system pushes a corn and grain-based feed (Smithfield says it no longer uses antibiotics for growth) into troughs, fattening the pigs for around weeks until they reach “market” weight - around The swine scatter when the barn door opens but then approach visitors with curiosity, snuffling at the bars that enclose them. Huge fans push air across the pigs, salving the North Carolinian heat and expelling their fragrance out of one end of the barn. Neither the barn nor faecal lagoon are immediately unpleasant to the nose and the Kings maintain they follow state rules around waste storage and disposal. In a state with a fetish for barbecue and foundational ideas of familial farming, criticism of the industrialisation of hog farming is often met with reflexive, but polite, disagreement. Share your stories from inside the farming industry “People don’t like me talking this way, I don’t get invited to many things any more,” said Don Webb, a former hog farmer turned opponent of the industry. Webb, a former teacher who is gave up his hog operation after complaints from his neighbours more than years ago and has been tangling with Murphy-Brown and its supporters ever since. “I got a call a few years ago saying ‘we will kill you, you goddamn nigger-loving son of a bitch’,” said Webb, pulling out a revolver from his truck glove box that he said he carries for protection. Webb, a tall man who sports red braces and a baseball cap, purchased around acres he hoped to turned into a campsite and line dancing venue, only for a hog farm to sprout up across the road. “I can’t use my property the way I’d like to, because of the odour,” he said. “These hog pens aren’t next to country clubs, but we are asked to live in the third-world conditions with hogs and faeces. We are humans, not animals. It wrong to stink up other people lives. God made it stink so we’d stay away from it.” Webb said he raised the issue with Wendell Murphy, a farmer turned state representative considered the progenitor of North Carolina hog warehouses, with no success. Political support for the industry is now entrenched – a state bill passed last year limits the amount of damages paid to hog farm neighbours, meaning it unlikely the in the Kinlaw case will be paid out. A moratorium on new lagoons was put in place in and this has slowed the growth in hog farm numbers. Still, more than hog facilities remain in the state, with North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality imposing fines for violations over the past five years. Another complication is the lack of alternatives for the lagoons and field spraying – Smithfield agreed to invest in finding new technologies in and yet, nearly years on, no single system has been deemed viable as a replacement. In lieu of this, the company points to improvements in waste reduction and schemes that would trap methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the lagoons and convert it into energy.

It a huge animal,” says photojournalist Carolina Arantes, who took the arresting portrait of Jabriel. “I think it reflects the energy of the business – the power, the heaviness and the size and the force.” Arantes, who is now based in France, spent three years travelling back and forth to her home country to document the secret and often spectacular world of luxury cattle farming. Her project, entitled Holy Cow , traces the rural capitalists and their designer cattle that make up this billion-dollar industry. “I don’t think Brazilians know exactly how important it is. Some people know the size, but they don’t know exactly the weight of this and the global meat industry,” she says. Jabriel is the property of Navirai Farm. One of their most important clients is the Rodrigues family, owners of a farm, and one of the Brazilian families that has for decades been cross-breeding cattle to improve the quality of the meat and the profitability of their beef herds. Their work dates back to the century when the zebu – a horned and humped animal – was brought over from India to mix with the European breeds that were already being farmed in Brazil . Viewed as a holy animal in India, the zebu is has, in a way, become sacred for the Brazilian farmers too, as its genes are part of some of the most prized bulls in the country, like Jabriel. Farmers work with genetics companies to improve the performance and profitability of their herds . In laboratories such as Alta Genetics in the state of Uberaba, the genes of the most elite cows and bulls are stored and fertilised before the embryos are transported to the company clients – breeders and wealthy farmers – to artificially inseminate surrogate cows across the country. Alta Genetics has the capacity to house bulls, carefully looked after to make sure there a good production of semen. These farmers and scientists are working to create cattle types that will be fatter, stronger, quicker to maturity, according to Arantes. “The farmers in their genetic labs are thinking how are they going to cross to create animals that can go to slaughter houses earlier, that can be fat enough, that can handle storms and rains for a long time, or dry moments for long time – animals that can be adapted to the impacts of climate change.” The end goal, Arantes argues, is to increase Brazil power in the international meat industry, even to the point of producing animals to be resistant to changes brought about by global warming. She says the sperm of these elite bulls may cost per dose, so buying them is an investment. “It an animal that turning into a bank – its genetic material is selling for so much. “The owners of this cattle are keeping them in these labs; it like a pet shop. The owner keeps the bull at Alta Genetics, and on his farm he crosses its genetic material with other animals of quality, and then maybe he sells the [offspring of] these animals in auctions.” At the cattle auctions, which are drink-fuelled and extravagant affairs, the animals are judged for their quality based on ankle size, testicle size, and even the distance between their eyes. The auctions are exclusive, dominated by wealth and macho culture, Arantes says. “It a very male environment. All this cattle business is very conservative in Brazil, very catholic, macho, white – and it important because they are very linked to politics,” she says. It is the exclusivity and wealth at the top of Brazil meat industry that makes it so intriguing. Though the industry has been tainted by the use of slave labour in its farms , to corruption scandals reaching the higher echelons of government, Brazil overtook the US as the biggest meat producer in and aims to reach a chunk of the international beef market soon – almost doubling its current status. The production levels are incredibly high. Hong Kong, for example, bought more than tonnes of beef in February alone. There currently roughly one head of cattle per person in a country of million people, and though Brazil is a large country with vast amounts of land, the environmental implications are significant. “It the intention of the [agricultural] lobby to double this number [of cattle] in the next decade, but do we, the Brazilian people, want them to double this number? Is it what we need to do now in the world? This should be discussed openly,” Arantes says.

93,"hey call Chris Winn the signatures guy. A delivery driver by day, he spends his free time drumming up support for animal rights. “When I did the shark fin ban I got signatures,” says Winn, “Usually I’m the top guy in California .” Now he on a new mission. It a cold Saturday afternoon in San Francisco and Winn is jubilant, bundled in a hat and sweatshirt, scouting for signatories for a proposed law that would ban the sale of any eggs, pork or veal that comes from an animal that spent its life in a cage. If passed it would be the most progressive farm animal welfare law in the world. Share your stories from inside the farming industry The law is only possible thanks to the quirky US ballot measure system which allows organisations and individuals to bypass politicians and put potential laws directly to a vote by the general population – as long as they can get enough signatures to support the measure in the first place. In California that means collecting a tremendous signatures – and so for the last four months animal lovers across the state have been fanning out on street corners every chance they get, clipboards in hand. So far they are nearing but even with less than two months to go before the May deadline, Carol Misseldine, the campaign northern California coordinator, is optimistic. “The response has been very positive,” she says when we meet, as volunteers assembled for a day of signature hunting. “Most people see it as a no-brainer. That being said, we are all gonna have to hustle.” The new measure would ban cages of any kind for hens, gestation crates (known as sow stalls in the UK) for mother pigs, so narrow they can’t turn around, and veal crates for calves, which restrict movement for their entire lives. By the end of all hens would have to be cage-free – living, at minimum, on an open barn floor or in an indoor aviary with multiple levels for birds to go up and down. It would have national implications, applying not just to in-state famers but to any farmer doing business with the world sixth largest economy. “This is history in the making,” says Josh Balk, the vice-president of farm animals protection for the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), one of the numerous organisations that has supported the law along with Animal Legal Defense Fund, Compassion in World Farming and local groups such as the San Diego Humane Society. “This is the greatest shot farm animals have ever had.” Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farming, calls the measure “a remarkable step” that would put California ahead of the EU – which has banned battery cages since – and even cage-free leaders such as Germany and the Netherlands . The last couple of years have seen some steps forward for farm animal welfare across the US. In McDonalds announced that its US and Canada locations would be going cage-free , impacting eggs a year, while saw pledges from major supermarkets including Safeway , Albertsons , and Walmart – which alone sells of the nation groceries – to go cage-free by And California has been ahead of the curve, passing Proposition in which banned battery cages and said animals must have space to turn around, lie down and stretch their limbs. But in Massachusetts made history with the first sales ban on products from confined animals, which passed by a landslide That currently makes it the best place to be a farm animal in America – a trophy California wants to reclaim. “There a certain pride around here,” says Misseldine. “We want to be back in the lead.” Animals farmed: join us for monthly updates But some US farmers and industry bodies are deeply concerned by the changes. Nationally, the US Department of Agriculture points out that with just of the country million hens currently in cage-free housing, meeting demand would require a “momentous” shift and cost egg producers billions. In Iowa, the nation largest egg producer, a bill currently poised to become law would require grocers selling cage-free eggs to stock cheaper, caged eggs as well. Lawmakers say the bill, which would affect grocers participating in a federal food-assistance program, is an effort to help low-income shoppers. Pork, veal and egg producers say California plan will raise prices for consumers, come at a high cost to small farmers, and in the case of veal, which has largely moved away from crates, ban a problem that doesn’t exist. For farmers, the shift can be crippling. “When a farmer invests in a cage system he hoping to get at least a lifespan,” explains Ken Klippen, the spokesman for the National Association of Egg Farmers. “Then if just a couple years later he got to go cage-free, which can cost up to per chicken, the financial burden is so oppressive that some just give up.” Californian poultry farmer Frank Hilliker is making the switch to cage-free, but he worried about the price tag. His farm, Hilliker Ranch Fresh Eggs , in Lakeside was started by his grandparents. After Prop he converted several barns to cage-free and others to cages compliant with the new space requirements. “To date I’ve spent about Hilliker says. “The bank owns me right now. And I’m not even done. In total I’ll probably have spent about Hilliker sees cage-free as a good business opportunity, but says being pushed to change too fast is unsustainable. “The voters of California shouldn’t be legislating the way I farm. Do they know more about egg farming than I do?” Chickens live well in cages, he adds, because they’re cleaner (wire floors allow bird droppings to pass through, rather than gather underfoot) and less stressful – hens are quick to establish a pecking order and, in large, free roaming groups, birds are more vulnerable to attack. “Look, I love being a farmer,” he says by phone while driving into California central valley. “I take more pride in that than anything. But sometimes I just get down a little bit, because people consider us the enemy.” But polling in April by the HSUS found in favor of the new law. If the campaigners get the signatures they need, there is an excellent chance that it will be passed. “Factory farming has only been a part of our reality since the says Misseldine. “I think it will be a relatively short phenomenon, historically speaking. It just so clear that it is inhumane not to let animals that were born to move to move.” Should the measure get the go ahead, she’ll find out if Californians agree. Back in San Francisco, Winn is making steady progress with a crowd gathered to watch the Chinese New Year parade. A dragon puppet snakes its way past as music soars above the street. Cassandra Taylor, a vegan from nearby Alameda, adds her signature gladly, calling the idea “common sense” . “When I see these chickens all cooped up, stuck on top of each other, it not good. They can feel things. It just wrong.”",1190,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/07/history-in-the-making-california-aims-for-worlds-highest-farm-animal-welfare-law
94,"The RSPCA has launched an investigation after the release of footage that appears to show farm workers brutally kicking and punching pigs at a farm in Lincolnshire. The footage, released on Wednesday by animal protection group Animal Equality, appears to show workers at Fir Tree farm repeatedly kicking pigs in their heads and stomachs, with more than incidents recorded over days. At one point two workers join together to kick a pig which screams loudly in pain. One worker prods pigs with the tines of a manure fork. At another moment in the footage a worker leaps into a pen to kick the animals inside. The campaigners say they received a tip-off about the conditions on the farm, and placed hidden cameras in the buildings where violence had been reported. The images they captured shocked hardened campaigners. “We’re used to seeing the everyday brutality of these places,” said Dr Toni Shephard, Animal Equality UK director. “But this sort of violence you really don’t often see. The workers show complete contempt for the animals in their care and seem immune to their suffering, even when the pigs scream in pain. We demand that they be brought to justice.” Shephard added: “Consumers can help end this cruelty by trying the increasing variety of plant-based foods available in shops and restaurants – which are often healthier than meat as well as cruelty-free.” According to some reports the workers responsible have now been sacked. The family that runs the farm said: “We are shocked by the actions of those involved as their abhorrent behaviour does not represent our business. We are a family-run farm where the care and welfare of our pigs is paramount. We have been able to identify the four individuals in the film and following an immediate investigation their employment has been terminated.” The RSPCA does not comment on individual cases, but stated: “Farm animals are sentient creatures who feel pleasure and fear. Like any animal they deserve to be treated with kindness, compassion and respect. We would like to reassure people we will always look into and, if necessary, investigate any complaints made to us about animal welfare.”",358,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/23/rspca-to-investigate-lincolnshire-farm-after-workers-filmed-kicking-pigs
95,"he way that meat, eggs and milk are produced is surrounded by one of our great silences, in which most people collaborate. We don’t want to know, because knowing would force anyone with a capacity for empathy to change their diet. You break this silence at your peril. After I published an article on chicken farming last week, I had to re-read it to check that I hadn’t actually proposed the slaughter of the firstborn by terrorist devil worshippers – so outraged and vicious were some of the responses. And that was just the consumers. The producers didn’t like it much either, though their trade associations responded in more measured tones. In letters to the Guardian on Saturday , the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) and the British Poultry Council (BPC) angrily defended the industry. The NFU wrote: In the UK of all chicken is produced to Red Tractor standards and this demonstrates that the chicken has met production standards developed by experts on animal welfare, safety, hygiene and the environment. Farmers take the welfare of their birds extremely seriously, and therefore to accuse the sector of cruelty is absolutely unfounded. The BPC maintained that chicken “provides a wholesome, nutritious, sustainable and affordable source of protein, produced by an industry unsubsidised by government.” Let spend a moment examining these claims, before raising the issue of how they get away with it. In my view, the Red Tractor standard is a classic example of an almost meaningless label, whose purpose is to reassure customers in a vague and fuzzy way while holding producers to standards that scarcely rise above the legal minimum. That a long-winded way of saying bullshit. Take the key welfare issue, stocking density. Here what the government recommendations say : The maximum stocking density for chickens kept to produce meat for the table should be which should not be exceeded at any time during the growing period. But the standard for broiler chickens set by the Red Tractor scheme is actually worse: Planned stocking densities must not exceed for broilers Incidentally, this stocking density – – gives each bird an area the size of a piece of paper . This meets the legal requirement only because the UK uses a cruel derogation from European law, permitting a maximum stocking density of So much for the NFU statement about taking the welfare of chickens extremely seriously. On almost every welfare indicator, and across all the main farm animals, including chickens, Red Tractor scored worse than any other certification scheme evaluated by the charity Compassion in World Farming. Amazingly, the Red Tractor label imposes no restrictions on the growth rates of chickens: it allows the most overbred varieties to be stuffed with high-protein feed, with the result that the birds often suffer from painful and crippling health problems, as their hearts, lungs and legs are overloaded. As for the BPC sustainability claims, if chickens fed on soya – as the great majority in this country are – are sustainable, what does unsustainable look like? Soya production is one of the major agents of the destruction of rainforests, the Cerrado and other threatened habitats in South America. The environmental impacts of chickenfeed are, well, anything but chickenfeed. The mass production of chickens has major consequences at the other end of the bird too: the mountains of excrement cause both water and air pollution. Crops for animal feed destroying Brazilian savannah, WWF warns Nor is the claim that this industry is unsubsidised correct. Many chicken growers barely break even on the sale of birds, and survive only as a result of the government renewable heat incentive (RHI). This is a remarkably generous scheme whose ostensible purpose is to reduce carbon emissions, but which functions as another subsidy for businesses , especially farms. Most new chicken units use biomass boilers subsidised by the RHI, and it is immensely profitable. So now to the real question: how do they get away with it? How is it that we, who regard ourselves as a nation of animal lovers, accept such terrible standards of meat production? If dogs and cats were treated as pigs and chickens are, there would be a deafening outcry: in fact there are plenty of people in Britain who campaign against the raising of dogs and cats for food in Asia. But what the difference? Why is it acceptable to treat some animals – even creatures as intelligent and capable of suffering as pigs – so brutally, but not others? In part, this reflects the deep disavowal in which we tend to engage when we eat meat. But I also believe that a major part of the problem is the fairytale view of farming implanted in our minds from the very onset of consciousness. Many of the books produced for very young children are about farms; and most tell broadly the same story. The animals – generally just one or two of each species – live in perfect harmony with the rosy-cheeked farmer, roaming around freely and talking to each other, almost as if they were members of the farmer family. Understandably enough, none of the uncomfortable issues – slaughter, butchery, castration, tusking, separation, battery production, farrowing crates – ever feature. So deeply embedded is this image that I believe many people go through life unable to dismiss it from their minds. It is not easy to unlearn what we are taught when we’re very young, and even the grim realities of industrial farming cannot displace the storybook images from our minds. At a deep, subconscious level, the farm remains a place of harmony and kindness – and this suits us very well if we want to keep eating meat. Perhaps the starkest example of this myth-making I’ve come across is a children book distributed with Saturday Guardian called The Tale of City Sue . It tells the story of a herd of cows on an Irish farm. “This friendly, Friesian family were free to roam and browse and eat the freshest, greenest grass which made them happy cows. “They belonged to farmer Finn Who called them by their names And when it was their birthday He brought party hats and games. “He played his violin for them inside the milking shed, and sung them soothing lullabies when it was time for bed.” Only after I had unthinkingly read it to my three-year-old then turned the back cover, did I discover that it wasn’t a book at all, but an extended advertisement for Kerrygold butter. It wasn’t billed as such. The Guardian website marketed this publication as “A tale from the meadow of imagination: children author Jeanne Willis latest book captures the idyllic atmosphere of rural Ireland.” Following my questions to the Guardian, this has now been changed to make its provenance clearer . I find disguised marketing of any kind objectionable, and disguised marketing to children even worse. I feel that this book misleads children about the nature of farming and milk production and sanitises the relationship between farmers and their animals, on behalf of a large corporation (Kerrygold parent company, Adams Foods). It exploits children credulity and natural sympathy with animals for corporate profits. When I challenged the Guardian about this, its spokesperson told me: All branded content should be clearly labelled for the benefit of our readers in line with our guidelines. On this occasion the insert was not correctly labelled and we apologise for this error. I also wrote to the author, Jeanne Willis, who replied as follows: “I was commissioned by Kerrygold so it best they answer your questions. Xxxx Xxxx from Brazen PR will be in touch soon.” Brazen PR. Hmmm. I wrote back, asking her: Do children authors not have a responsibility towards those they write for? Is there not an issue of conscience here for you? After all, if a children author is misleading children on behalf of a corporation, that a serious matter, surely? It has been done in your name, and promoted as your “latest book”, so simply shrugging off responsibility like this feels wrong to me. You must have a view about whether or not accepting this commission was the right thing to do, and whether you were justified in discharging it as you did. She responded as follows: ... to the best of my knowledge, Kerrygold seem to be particularly strong on animal welfare so there wasn’t a question that what I created was going to be misleading. The brief was very simple: Kerrygold cows spend a lot of time outside feeding on grassy meadows so let tell some fun stories about our cows. I don’t feel it exploiting kids because the only take out is that it better to feed cows on grass and ensure they spend as much time outside as possible. I’m very careful which brands I work with to avoid this exact situation – I wouldn’t have done this if I thought it was morally wrong. It a storybook for families to enjoy. There is no overt message to buy butter. It just about the cows. That said, it clearly says Kerrygold on the inside cover and on the back. It seems to me that subliminal persuasion of this kind (“the cows are happy”) can be more insidious than overt marketing (“buy our butter”). To my mind, Kerrygold is seeking to persuade people of the inherent goodness of its products at a deeper level than merely flashing up the products. As for the issue of animal welfare, Kerrygold website states “We work with small co-operative farms where small herds are free to graze on lush Irish meadows.” But it does not say “We work only with small co-operative farms ...”. The parent website run by Adams puts it slightly differently : “Kerrygold is ... owned by Irish dairy farmers, many of their farms are small and family run”. Which could also mean that many of them are not. So I asked the company, “What is your milk buying policy? In other words, what specifications – on scale, feed, the treatment of animals, process etc – do you put in place that your suppliers have to adhere to?” I have not had a response. From what I can glean, Kerrygold marketing seems to rely on the public perception that Irish dairy farms are small and mostly grass-fed. But they are changing fast. Last summer, dairy farmers visited the biggest dairy operation in the country (which has milking animals) to discover how to increase the scale of their operations. This farm has made a major investment in indoor facilities , and supplements the grass they are fed with maize, barley and soya. According to the former chair of the Irish Farmers’ Association, “scale must go up. ... The dairy farm of the future is going to have to be bigger.” Could the current Kerrygold marketing blitz be an attempt to embed in our minds a bucolic, superannuated image of an industry that is now changing beyond recognition? If so, it might be an effective way of pre-empting criticism about the changing nature of its suppliers. Dairy cows, like chickens and pigs, also get a rough deal , while the effluent from dairy farms creates major environmental problems . Imagine the response if children were exposed to such blatant sanitisation of a harsh and polluting industry in any other sector. But so prevalent is this mythologised view of farming, and so wilfully unaware do we remain of the realities of industrial agriculture, that it passes almost without challenge. My guess is that the Guardian made this error – a serious one in my view – partly because the themes Jeanne Willis and Kerrygold exploited are so familiar that they are almost background noise. Isn’t it time that children authors showed a little more imagination and stopped repeatedly churning out the same basic story, even when they are not doing it on behalf of a large corporation? Is it not time that adults weaned themselves off the fairytale version of farming and began to judge it by the same standards as we would judge other industries? And is it not time for all of us to become a little more curious about where meat, milk and eggs come from, and how they are produced?

96,"Using animals’ own immune systems may provide a way to reduce the overuse of antibiotics in farming , replacing the drugs with cheap farm byproducts and cutting the growing risk of resistance to common medicines , new research has suggested. Natural antibodies, produced by the immune system without previous infection, in animals and humans, can protect the body against harmful bacteria. They are present in some usually unconsidered farm byproducts, such as the whey left over from milk production, and they could be administered to animals easily in feed. The research, published in the open access journal Veterinary Research , found that antibodies could provide a protection against immediate infection, and act prophylactically by helping animals’ immune systems to be more resistant over time to potential future threats. A significant benefit of treating livestock preventatively with antibodies, rather than curing them with antibiotics, would be that harmful bacteria would have less opportunity to improve its antibiotic resistance. The authors, from the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, found that “innate immune mechanisms are highly relevant, as they offer rapid general ways to, at least partially, protect against infections and enable the build-up of a sufficiently adaptive immune response”. They found two particularly promising alternatives to antibiotics: immunoglobulins, which can act in the body as defence molecules against infections; and peptides, which help the host system in its defence against pathogens, partly by delaying the establishment of infection. The production of these can be induced in the host animal, or can be used to create vaccines. However, the authors of the new research warned that antibody treatments, while promising, are still some way from common commercial use. For that to be possible, much more research is needed, both to prove their effectiveness and make them widely available. They called for more work on the area as a matter of urgency, if the global antibiotic crisis is to be averted. Treatments for livestock account for the majority of antibiotics used around the world, and they are often controversial. Whole herds or flocks are routinely treated when only one or a few animals are infected, even in regions where antibiotic use on animals is closely regulated, such as Europe. In some other regions, including China and other Asian countries, the routine use of antibiotics to promote faster growth of livestock is also widespread. Physicians are increasingly concerned that the widespread, and sometimes indiscriminate, use of antibiotics in farming is a key cause of the growing resistance to antimicrobial medicines that is leading to an increasing number of diseases becoming untreatable in humans . The World Health Organisation made a plea last year for governments to ban at least the strongest and most important antibiotics, the drugs “of last resort” for human health, for use on animals, but with little response. If even some commonly used antibiotics could be substituted with antibody-based treatments, it would be a major step forward in reducing antibiotic use around the world. For that to happen, cheap alternatives are essential, as antibiotics are so cheaply available, according to the Utrecht researchers. Coilin Nunan, scientific adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics , said: “Any new treatment which can be shown to be safe and effective for individual sick animals would be welcome, particularly if it helps reduce antibiotic use. But instead of trying to develop alternative forms of mass medication, our priority should be to increase animal health through improved husbandry. Piglets naturally receive antibodies in their mother milk and often develop diarrhoea when they are weaned early. What is needed for better piglet health is later weaning rather than adding antibodies to their feed.”",607,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/31/livestock-treatment-may-offer-solution-to-antibiotics-crisis-say-scientists
97,"Record high temperatures have been set across much of the world this week as an unusually prolonged and broad heatwave intensifies concerns about climate change. The past month has seen power shortages in California as record heat forced a surge of demand for air conditioners. Algeria has experienced the hottest temperature ever reliably registered in Africa. Britain, meanwhile, has experienced its third longest heatwave, melting the roof of a science building in Glasgow and exposing ancient hill forts in Wales . The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the rising temperatures were at odds with a global cyclical climate phenomenon known as La Niña, which is usually associated with cooling. “The first six months of the year have made it the hottest La Niña year to date on record,” said Clare Nullis of the WMO. Taiwan is the most recent place to report a new high with a temperature of in Tianxiang on Monday. This followed a flurry of other anomalies. Last week, a weather station at Ouargla in Algeria Sahara Desert, reported a maximum temperature of on July, the highest temperature reliably recorded in Africa. Even when the sun goes down, night is not providing the cooling relief it once did in many parts of the world. At Quriyat, on the coast of Oman , overnight temperatures remained above which is believed to be the highest “low” temperature ever recorded in the world. Downtown Los Angeles also saw a new monthly July minimum overnight record of on July. Globally, the warmest year on record was in boosted by the natural climate cycle El Niño. Last year, temperatures hit the highest level without that amplifying phenomenon . This year, at the other cooling end of the cycle, is continuing the overall upward trend. Swathes of the northern hemisphere have seen unusually persistent warmth due to strong, persistent high pressure systems that have created a “heat dome” over much of Eurasia. “What unusual is the hemispheric scale of the heatwave,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “It not just the magnitude in any one location but that high temperatures are being seen over such a large area.” Northern Russia exceptionally sunny weather – seen on TV by billions thanks to the World Cup – has caused wildfires that affected hectares of forest near the Krasnoyarsk region, which reported daily anomalies of above average. The Western Siberian Hydromet Center has issued storm warnings after temperatures of more than for five days. Climate watchers fear this will accelerate the melting of permafrost, releasing methane – a far more potent greenhouse gas than In California, daytime records were also set last week at Chino Burbank airport and Van Nuys airport In Canada, at least deaths have been attributed to the prolonged heatwave and high humidity in Quebec. Montreal saw a new record high temperature of on July. In Europe, the WMO has warned of droughts, wildfires and harvest losses after the second hottest June on record. Over the past two weeks, records have been set in Tbilisi ( , Shannon and Belfast Britain has cooled slightly in the past two days, after days of temperatures over This was the third longest heatwave on record, following the record run in and the famous summer of when there were two prolonged spells of days and days. Dean Hall of the UK Met Office said Britain temperatures were forecast to rise again over the coming week. The concern is that weather fronts – hot and cold – are being blocked more frequently due to climate change. This causes droughts and storms to linger, amplifying the damage they cause. This was a factor in the recent devastating floods in Japan , where at least people died after rainfall up to four times the normal level. Paolo Ruti of the WMO said it was difficult to ascribe any one weather event to climate change, but that recent high temperatures, intense rains and slow-moving fronts were in line with forecasts of how rising emissions will affect the climate. “Recent analysis suggests that anthropogenic forcing might indeed affect the characteristics of summer blocking events in the Euro-Asia sector, in particular leading to longer blocking episodes,” he said. Extreme weather events have buffeted much of the world over the past from the “Day Zero” drought in Cape Town to the abnormally powerful hurricanes Harvey and Irma that buffeted the east coast of the US and Caribbean. Underscoring the link, a new report from scientists at the World Weather Attribution group indicates that manmade climate change and its effect on rainfall made the recent Cape Town drought three times more likely.",775,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/13/heatwave-sees-record-high-temperatures-set-around-world-this-week
98,"It widely accepted that climate change will have bigger negative impacts on poorer countries than wealthy ones. However, a new economic modeling study finds that the economic impacts on these poorer countries could be much larger than previous estimates. As a result, they suggest that we should be aiming to limit global warming to near, or perhaps even less than the international target of This conclusion is in sharp contrast to current economic models, which generally conclude that the economically optimal pathway results in a global surface warming around . Current economic models mainly treat economic growth as an external factor. In these models, global warming and its impacts via climate change don’t significantly affect the rate at which the economy grows. However, several economic studies have concluded that this is an inaccurate assumption, with a paper by Melissa Dell and colleagues taking the first stab at quantifying the effects of climate damages on economic growth. The new study by Frances Moore and Delavane Diaz of Stanford University calibrates the climate ‘damage functions’ in one of these economic models ( DICE , developed by William Nordhaus at Yale) using the results from the Dell paper. They grouped the world into rich and poor countries, finding that while the economies of rich countries continue to grow well in a warmer world, the economic growth of poor countries is significantly impaired. As a result, Moore and Diaz conclude that the economically optimal pathway could be very similar to the most aggressive scenario considered by the IPCC ( called ). In this scenario, human carbon emissions peak almost immediately and then decline until they reach zero around the year Moore and Diaz find that if climate change does affect GDP growth in this way, then the best path for society would limit temperatures to between and warming in with a best estimate of around warming. The study estimates the impact on economic growth in poor countries if we continue on a business-as-usual carbon pollution and rapid climate change path: The average annual growth rate in poor regions is cut from to which means that by per-capita GDP is below reference. One challenge is that there are two factors that may contribute to the bigger impact of climate change on economic growth in poorer countries, and we don’t know which effect is bigger. As poor countries are, on average, hotter than rich countries, they are exposed more frequently to damaging temperatures and therefore show higher sensitivity to temperature. Under this mechanism, the sensitivity of rich countries would increase as they warm. Alternatively, higher temperatures may be more damaging in poor countries because their economies are reliant on climate-exposed sectors such as agriculture and natural resource extraction, or because risk management options such as insurance or air conditioning are not as widely available. In this case we would expect the sensitivity of poor regions to warming to decrease as per-capita GDP increases. In other words, poorer countries may have the resources to adapt to climate change as they become wealthier in the future. On the other hand, if their economic growth is sensitive to global warming mainly because they’re located in hotter parts of the planet, then their economies will struggle in a hotter future world. The ‘social cost of carbon’ is an estimate of the costs of carbon pollution to society via climate damages. It an important number in terms of setting federal policy. In May the US government revised its estimate of the social cost of carbon from per ton of carbon dioxide emitted to per ton, to great consternation from the Republican Party . The new figure was based in large part on the average of the estimates from current economic models. However, Moore and Diaz conclude that when accounting for climate impacts on economic growth, the social carbon cost rises to between about and with a best estimate of over per ton. This suggests that even the new, higher US government estimate is too low. Frances Moore told me, Our estimate of per ton includes the assumption that there will be fairly rapid and effective adaptation to climate change impacts. If there is no adaptation, then the social cost of carbon is substantially larger. So its not an either / or choice between adaptation and mitigation policy. The results of this study also suggest that estimates of the social cost of carbon to date have underestimated the already large uncertainty in its value. This suggests that climate policies should focus on risk management , as Delavane Diaz explains, Rather than attempt to identify a single exact value for the social cost of carbon, mitigation policy should be designed with the goal being to manage uncertain climate risks. There another important take-away from this study. There have been a lot of arguments , based on current economic models, that the costs from climate damages won’t be so large, and that we should instead focus on other problems. By failing to account for the impacts of climate damages on economic growth, to date these models appear to have significantly underestimated their costs. When accounting for the full impacts of climate damages, there a strong economic case for immediate aggressive efforts to cut carbon pollution.",871,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jan/26/climate-change-could-impact-poor-much-more-than-previously-thought
99,"The Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University (NYU) School of Law recently published a report summarizing a survey of economists with climate expertise. The report was a follow-up and expansion of a similar survey conducted in by the same institute. The key finding: there a strong consensus among climate economics experts that we should put a price on carbon pollution to curb the expensive costs of climate change. The survey participants included economists who have published papers related to climate change “in a highly ranked, peer-reviewed economics or environmental economics journal since Overall, participants completed the survey, which established the consensus of expert climate economists on a number of important questions. Carbon pollution cuts are needed regardless of what other countries do In the version of the survey, the respondents were asked under what conditions the United States should commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. answered that the US should cut its emissions no matter what actions other countries take, while another said that American emissions cuts would be warranted if many or all other countries commit to reducing theirs ( as just happened in the Paris international negotiations ). In the survey, the number of expert economists saying that the US should cut its emissions no matter what rose to A further said that if other countries agree to cut their emissions, the US should follow suit. In other words, there is a consensus among expert climate economists that the US should follow through with its pledges to cut carbon pollution in the wake of the Paris international climate negotiations, and more than three out of four agreed that the US should take action to curb global warming no matter what. This expert consensus is in stark contrast to conservative political opposition to the Paris accord. For example, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said of the agreement , This kind of unilateral disarmament in our economy is reckless, and it is hurting the American Dream Quite obviously an international agreement made by nations around the world is the antithesis of unilateral action. However, of expert economists agree that unilateral action would be appropriate in any case, directly contradicting Rubio comments. Additionally, of the experts agreed that by implementing climate policies, the US could strategically induce other countries to cut their carbon pollution. Climate change is already hurting the global economy When asked at what date climate change will have a net negative impact on the global economy, the median survey response was In the recent past, climate change likely had a net positive impact on the global economy, due primarily to the effect of carbon fertilization on crops and other plant life. However, even contrarian economists agree, when accounting for the vulnerability of poorer countries to climate impacts, global warming has been hurting the global economy since about . The NYU survey asked when the economic benefits we experienced up to would be completely wiped out; of respondents said that already happened. Another answered that it would happen within a decade, and said we’d see net negative economic impacts by If we continue with business-as-usual pollution and warming, on average the experts predicted a GDP loss of about by the end of the century, and that there would be a chance of a “catastrophic” loss of one-quarter of global GDP. Of course, ideally we would have stopped warming the planet in to preserve the economic benefits of global warming to that date. At this point it a question of just how much damage climate change will do to the global economy, and the economic experts are worried that the results could be catastrophic. Climate change will hurt economic growth of the survey participants said that it likely or extremely likely that climate change will have a long-term negative impact on the growth rate of the global economy. That an important point, because most current integrated economic-climate assessment models assume that economic growth will continue regardless of climate change impacts. There been a growing body of research indicating that as you might expect, that won’t be the case . The results of this survey question show that most expert economists agree, climate change will hurt global economic growth. That also suggests that past model-based studies likely significantly underestimated the costs of climate change. Along the same lines, of the experts answered that the US government estimate for the “social cost of carbon” per metric ton), which is largely based on estimates from these models, is too low. of the experts said that value is about right, and just said it too high. Carbon pricing is an efficient way to cut pollution The survey also asked the experts about the most economically efficient method of reducing carbon pollution. said a market-based system (carbon tax or cap and trade system) would be most efficient, while answered that coordinated performance standards and programs that prioritize cleaner fuels and energy efficiency would be most efficient. In the US, President Obama Clean Power Plan is closer to the latter system of performance standards, although the president has said he would prefer the type of market-based system favored by of economic experts. Implementing a carbon tax or cap and trade system would require bipartisan congressional action, but over the past several years, Republican Party leaders have shown scant interest in crafting the efficient climate policies favored by economic experts and by their own voters . Consensus of economic experts: cut carbon pollution The NYU survey reveals a clear economic consensus on global warming. The experts agree: climate change is hurting the global economy, we should mitigate those costs by cutting carbon pollution, and the most efficient way to do that is with a market-based system like a carbon tax or cap and trade system. This expert consensus clearly contradicts the arguments made by Republican Party leaders and other opponents of climate policies – that taking these actions will cripple the economy. In reality, economists are worried that if we fail to cut carbon pollution and instead continue with business-as-usual, it will badly stunt economic growth and may potentially lead to catastrophic economic consequences. However, we can still solve the problem while creating jobs and growing the economy , if our political leaders will listen to the economic experts and their voters. So far, convincing Republican Party leaders to listen to an expert climate consensus has been a fruitless task, but there are signs that the party is starting to move in the right direction .",1082,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution

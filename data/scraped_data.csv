Strict lockdown measures and reduced transport in the country meant many travellers were unable to reach chartered repatriation flights last month. A total of British nationals and foreign nationals stranded in isolated parts of the country were picked up over three weeks. Using the local knowledge of British Ghurka networks based in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dharan, staff at the UK Embassy and soldiers were able to locate the travellers and devise plans to reach them. David Agren The Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has accused international media outlets of lying as stories accumulate on the country alleged undercounting of its case numbers and death toll. Investigations by the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and El País have all included such suggestions. In a rambling response to an unrelated question, López Obrador complained about reporters “going to graveyards” and crematoria to verify deaths. The famously stubborn López Obrador, who seldom lets critical comments pass unanswered, also called for the foreign press to practice some “self-criticism”. There a crisis of the lack of ethics in the handling of information in Mexico, in the world. The world most famous newspapers lie, slander. The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Financial Times, El País, are very famous, but without ethics. The outburst came after Reforma, a Mexican newspaper López Obrador frequently criticises, reported it had received threats from someone claiming to be part of the Sinaloa Cartel to blow up its building if it didn’t stop critical coverage. Mexico has reported cases and deaths as of Thursday. A Sky News investigation estimated Mexico City death rate is five times higher than the official figures. Still, parts of the country will reopen on Monday and López Obrador says the curve has been “flattened”. The president has said he will ask the health secretariat it is okay for him to resume his tours of the country to check on the progress of mega projects under construction and open branches of a government bank. Medical experts have questioned if Mexico is ready to reopen; the country has guided its response with disease modelling, rather than testing. Its testing rates rank among the lowest in Latin America at per people. Paul MacInnes English Premier League squads could be quarantined in the event of a single failed test if clubs vote to return to training next week. Players are to be tested for twice a week during a first stage of return, with a positive test requiring the player to isolate for seven days under Public Health England guidelines. But the rules also require that a “contact” of a known case should isolate, as someone would if they were living in the same house. That quarantine period should last for days. The English Football League, in training protocols sent to its clubs this week, confirmed that a “playing group” would be quarantined for days if one of their number tested positive. The Premier League would not comment on the details of its protocols but confirmed it was following PHE guidelines. Single failed test spells quarantine for Premier League squads Patrick Wintour Beijing has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan call to be represented at next week assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China . The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday and Taiwan attendance – as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic – are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. Chinese diplomats have been contacting governments across Europe to limit the diplomatic support for Taiwan attendance, targeting northern and eastern European states. Maintaining collective EU unity on China is proving difficult. But in a letter to the Guardian , the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen , the former president of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski and the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt argue that Taiwan should be permitted to attend because of its pioneering response to the pandemic, which has drawn on the lessons of the Sars outbreak. Taiwan must accept Chinese status to attend WHO assembly, says Beijing Amazon is aiming to gradually reopen its French warehouses from May as it finalises an agreement with unions and work councils to end a spat that led to a more than one-month closure of the sites, Reuters reports. Its six French warehouses have been closed since April following court rulings that ordered it to restrict deliveries during the pandemic or face hefty fines. Portugal will reopen its beaches on June, its prime minister Antonio Costa has said. And he encouraged the public to download an app that will tell them if their beach of choice is full or still has space. Groups must stay apart, deck-chairs may only be booked for the morning or afternoon, and beach sports of two people or more will not be allowed, according to the new rules. But the police will not be keeping watch, Costa said, urging people to adhere to the measures by themselves. “Beaches should be places of leisure,” Costa said. “We have to be checking ourselves.” There is no agreement yet between European Union countries on how much of the bloc proposed new recovery fund should be handed out as grants to member states and how much in loans, a senior EU official has said. The official spoke to the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity as the EU executive in Brussels pushed back the unveiling of its new proposal for the bloc next long-term budget, and the accompanying recovery fund, until May. The fund aims to kick-start growth on the continent as it heads for its worst-ever economic downturn. The jackpot question is what is the size and what will be loans and grants. Here there is a lot of work to do... This process is an extremely fragile one. The official said all the EU member states agree that the European commission will raise money on capital markets for the recovery fund. The funds will be channelled through the EU next budget, called the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). “The question of loans or grants is not quite there,” the person said, adding that some of the northern EU countries continued to oppose handing out money in grants. Mexico automotive industry can exit the lockdown before June if companies have approved safety measures in place, the country government has said, seeking to set the record straight after sending out confusing signals on the matter. Announced in the government official gazette, the instructions should allow companies to reconnect key supply chains between Mexico and the rest of North America, which depends considerably on parts made south of the US border. The directive refers to manufacturers of transportation equipment, as well as the mining and construction industries, all of which the government have designated essential and from May can begin establishing security protocols. “If the process is concluded and approved before June, the relevant company or industry will be able to begin its operations,” the government said, noting that companies which put workers’ health at risk would be shut down. In the UK, the National Health Service ( NHS ) is making preparations to roll out its contact-tracing app nationwide before the end of the month, the Guardian understands. The smartphone app, which alerts people if they have come into contact with an individual who has reported coronavirus symptoms, is being trialed on the Isle of Wight and is a key part of the government “test, track and trace” strategy as the country eases out of lockdown. The health secretary, Matt Hancock , previously said the app, which has been beset by privacy issues , fears about its uptake among older people and concern it may be dropped entirely , would be released nationwide in mid-May. However, Simon Murphy, Heather Stewart, Alex Hern and Denis Campbell write that the wider public in England will now have to wait until at least the week commencing May. Hancock has been receiving daily progress updates, he said. Asked whether it would be rolled out to Scotland, he replied: “It will be a matter for the Scottish government. It will be available, but public health is a devolved matter.” NHS preparing to roll out contact-tracing app by end of May Updated at BST French health authorities have reported more deaths, or a decelerating increase of That brings the total to – the fourth worst in the world. The ministry added that the number of confirmed cases has risen to – up from on Thursday, which also represents a rise of in hours. Summary US president Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace . Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place. UK reproduction rate still close to bringing lockdown-easing steps into question. The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others – at between and An R value above means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. Europe could face deadly second wave of winter infections, WHO warns. Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is “time for preparation, not celebration”. Second health minister resigns in Brazil after less than a month on the job. Brazil health minister, Nelson Teich, handed in his resignation on Friday, his office said, after less than a month on the job as the country becomes a world hotspot for coronavirus. Teich is believed to have disagreed with the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil has now surpassed Germany and France and had more than confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday. Spain hails large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus. The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have “enormous consequences” given that only of Spaniards have had the disease.

Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place. Trump also said the government would invest in all the top coronavirus vaccine candidates and said a list had been narrowed to promising possibilities with a plan to narrow further. Updated at BST Sam Jones The Spanish government has just announced that the Madrid and Barcelona regions will remain in the first stage of lockdown de-escalation, but says some restrictions will be lifted. From Monday, small businesses in both regions will be allowed to serve people without prior appointments, and places of worship will be able to reopen at capacity. Almost three-quarters of the country will be in the second phase by Monday, while - some million people - will remain in the first stage of lockdown loosening.

1,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/uk-quarantine-for-travellers-to-now-include-french-arrivals,"Downing Street has rolled back on the idea of exempting travellers from France from incoming quarantine rules, with only freight drivers and experts working on efforts being able to avoid the isolation period. Boris Johnson used his TV address last Sunday to announce that quarantine restrictions would soon be imposed on people entering the UK, but only mentioned those arriving by air. It later became clear that the rules would also apply to arrivals by road, rail and sea. Later on Sunday, after a call between Johnson and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Downing Street said “no quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage”. Asked about it on Friday, however, Johnson spokesman said: “There isn’t a French exemption. What the statement at the weekend said was they were quoting measures applied to France [at that stage], and that was a joint statement between ourselves and the French.” Johnson spokesman pointed to the fact that the joint statement on Sunday said that the UK and France had set up a working group on the issue of border crossings. “What it went on to say is that we would be working with the French in the coming weeks because cooperation is particularly necessary for the management of our common border, and any steps that we do take would be implemented in a concerted and reciprocal manner,” he said. The joint statement had prompted some confusion in France where, the previous day the health minister, Olivier Véran, said a quarantine period would be imposed on everyone arriving in France. On Thursday, the UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, also rowed back on the idea, saying that it “seems fair and right that if we are asking the British people to stay at home and make such huge sacrifices in their own lives, then we would expect anybody coming back to the country, or visiting the country, to do the same thing, with some limited exceptions”. It is understood that freight drivers coming from or via France will be exempt, because forcing them into quarantine for two weeks would disrupt supplies of food, medicine and other goods. The working group, led on the UK side by Michael Gove, who has the cabinet title of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, is looking into ways this could happen while also allowing UK freight drivers the same exemption in France, perhaps with the use of testing. The other exempt group will be scientists and others working in areas connected to combating coronavirus, such as vaccine research. It is not yet known whether their exemption would apply to air travel into the UK as well as rail and sea routes from France. The government has faced increasing pressure to quarantine people arriving in the country, and has decided to act to try to prevent a new wave of infections as elements of the national lockdown are eased. The quarantine rules are expected to begin at the end of the month. The decision has angered the aviation industry , which says it could worsen the economic impact of the virus. The chief executives of easyJet, and Heathrow and Gatwick airports have signed a letter to the government expressing “collective and serious concern and frustration”, and demanding a meeting with Johnson. The wider travel industry has also expressed concern .",555
2,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-in-europe-states-take-small-steps-towards-normality,"Europe took a step towards post-virus normality on Friday when restaurants in Germany and Austria reopened for the first time in two months, and other countries loosened travel restrictions and threw open borders. Berlin restaurants, cafes and snack kiosks were allowed to serve customers again, so long as they obeyed physical distancing. People from two separate households could share a table, but had to keep a distance of from each other. Under new rules, waiting staff are required to wear face coverings. Cooks and other kitchen staff are not. Diners are also recommended to wear masks, but these are not compulsory – unless you use the toilet. Buffets are banned and food has to be cooked on the premises. While guests are not obliged to make reservations, Berlin senate has strongly advised restaurants to take down contact details of their customers, and to keep them for four weeks, in order to enable tracing in case of an infection. Anger in Madrid but calm in Barcelona at extended lockdown The likelihood is that restaurateurs in the German capital will soon be allowed to put chairs and tables in front of their establishments without having to gain the necessary permit – on condition that the pavement is wide enough. Berlin pubs and shisha bars remain shut. Austrian restaurants, cafes, bars, churches and some museums also reopened on Friday, with similar rules on face masks and physical distancing. The country has outlined plans for cultural events to resume next month – with people permitted at first, and from August. Vienna and Berlin offer a possible route map for other European countries, including France , which is considering reopening its restaurants on June. One district in the German capital, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, plans to ban traffic on Fridays and weekends, allowing restaurants to take over some streets. As infection rates flatten, travelling across the continent borders is becoming progressively easier. On Friday, Slovenia proclaimed an end to its coronavirus epidemic. EU citizens can now enter freely, but non-EU travellers have to go through quarantine. Italy is to allow travel within separate regions from May and is set to dispense with all national travel restrictions from June. Germany has dropped a two-week quarantine requirement imposed in March for passengers arriving from other EU states. Britain, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland are all included in the new arrangement. German officials, however, said that quarantine measures will be reimposed if the infection rate rises elsewhere. Germany public health advisory body, the Robert Koch Institute, said it will monitor other countries even more closely than it has been doing, in order to be aware of danger areas. The current R infection rate is – with every infected German giving the virus to fewer than one other person. Germany in recession as coronavirus blights eurozone economies It looks increasingly possible that EU citizens will be allowed to fly abroad this summer on holiday. Germany foreign minister, Heiko Maas, is due to hold talks on Monday with European counterparts from popular tourist destinations including Spain , Italy and Greece. The Baltic states of Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia have opened their borders to each other to create a “mini Schengen area”. Free movement of people will be restored to all million permanent residents of the Baltic states, but arrivals from outside the three countries will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period. The easing of lockdowns is in response to sinking national death rates. Denmark reported zero deaths on Friday for the first time since March, while Spain said its rate was falling. The Spanish health ministry announced fatalities, bringing the total to In Madrid, the government hailed large-scale population testing as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus. It has warned that any premature relaxation of restrictions could have “enormous consequences”, given that only of Spaniards have had the disease. In an interview with the Guardian, Pedro Duque, a former astronaut who serves as Spain science minister , said that the preliminary results of a nationwide serological study published earlier this week would be crucial to the government response. The study, which involved more than people , revealed that around of the population - some two million people - has had the coronavirus. It also showed that of those who had caught the virus had not shown any symptoms. “We think that the seroprevalence test we’ve carried out is the best that been done anywhere in the world so far. The most important conclusion we’ve reached is that it is vital to keep acting very prudently when it comes to this illness. There are still a lot of people who haven’t been exposed to the virus,” he said. He added: “The consequences of acting irresponsibly could be enormous given that we know that only of the population has some degree of immunity against the virus. That means that don’t.” Duque also dismissed talk of so-called “immunity passports” to allow more freedom of movement to those who have recovered from the disease. The science, he said, simply did not support such a move. “From a personal scientific point of view, all I can say is that we don’t even know for sure that immunity exists, so we’re very far from all of that. We don’t have scientific information that guarantees that people with the antibodies are immune to future infections.”",890
3,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/dutch-official-advice-to-single-people-find-a-sex-buddy-for-lockdown-coronavirus,"Single men and women in the Netherlands are being advised to organise a seksbuddy (sex buddy) after criticism of rules dictating that home visitors maintain a distance from their hosts during the coronavirus lockdown. In a typically open-minded intervention, official guidance from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has been amended to suggest those without a permanent sexual partner come to mutually satisfactory agreements with like-minded individuals. On the advice of scientists at the RIVM, the Netherlands has been on what the government describes as an “intelligent lockdown” since March, allowing up to three visitors into homes on the strict condition that they keep their distance. But the RIVM now concedes that “it makes sense that as a single [person] you also want to have physical contact” while warning that the risks of such intimacy should be managed. “Discuss how best to do this together,” the RIVM suggests. “For example, meet with the same person to have physical or sexual contact (for example, a cuddle buddy or ‘sex buddy’), provided you are free of illness. Make good arrangements with this person about how many other people you both see. The more people you see, the greater the chance of (spreading) the coronavirus.” The RVIM also has advice for those in a relationship with someone infected by coronavirus or in quarantine with suspected symptoms of the disease. “Don’t have sex with your partner if they have been isolated because of (suspected) coronavirus infection,” the RVIM says. “Sex with yourself or with others at a distance is possible (think of telling erotic stories, masturbating together).” In the UK, the government warned at the start of its lockdown that couples who do not cohabit must either not meet at all, or else rapidly move in together. Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, told reporters that dating couples “should test the strength of their relationship and decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household”. The Dutch institute change of mind on the fate of singletons follows the expression of immense frustration in some quarters at the rules for single people. In an opinion piece written in the Het Parool newspaper, Linda Duits, a journalist specialising in gender issues, squarely criticised the RIVM, arguing that sex was a human right. “Proximity and physical contact are not a luxury, they are basic needs,” Duits wrote. “If we have learned anything from the Aids epidemic, it is that not having sex is not an option.” The Dutch government has been easing its lockdown in recent weeks. Hairdressers, nail salons and beauty parlours started work again on Monday and restaurants, bars and cinemas are due to reopen on June. The measures come after evidence the spread of the coronavirus in the Netherlands has been controlled, although a further people were hospitalised in the last hours with deaths and another tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to",489

Kari Paul here in sunny Oakland, California to bring you the news over the next few hours. Stay tuned for updates. Late afternoon summary Thanks for tuning in for the day US politics and coronavirus news so far. The Guardian Kari Paul is taking the over the blog from the west coast now, to cover developments over the next few hours. The White House just wrapped another rose garden event and Donald Trump is headed to Camp David. Here are the main events so far today: Truckers on their day of protest about insufficient working conditions disrupted Donald Trump afternoon press conference by blasting air horns throughout the Rose Garden ceremony. Despite an FDA alert warning the coronavirus testing kit used in the White House may be providing false positives, Donald Trump said it is a “great test.” Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth has entered the veep race after being backed by a veteran group. Duckworth, a veteran, is the first senator to give birth while in office. Never Trump Republicans are holding a rival gathering during the Republican National Convention this year, reports the Washington Post. Updated at BST Terrorism charge over threat to governor Joanna Walters A man accused of making credible death threats against Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and state attorney general Dana Nessel has been charged on a terrorism count , the Wayne County prosecutor office said this afternoon. Robert Tesh made the threats via a social media message to an acquaintance on April and authorities concluded the message amounted to “credible threats to kill,” prosecutor Kym Worthy said Friday in a news release, the AP reports. Worthy didn’t provide any detail about the threats or how they were determined to be credible. Further details will be presented during court proceedings, she said. Detroit police officers arrested the man the same day at his home. He was arraigned April on a threat of terrorism charge. If convicted, Tesh could face up to years in prison. “Emotions are heightened on all sides now,” she told the Associated Press. “These threats ... they are not funny. They are not jokes. There is nothing humorous about it. Even if you don’t carry it out, we’re going to charge you criminally.” The threats from Tesh were not specific to Whitmer stay-at-home order issued in March in an effort to stem the spread of in the state, according to Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor office. Whitmer has been the target of protests and rallies over her executive order which shut down most businesses in the state. The order is effective at least until May Armed black citizens escort Michigan lawmaker to capitol after volatile rightwing protest “The alleged facts in this case lay out a very disturbing scenario,” Worthy said. “We understand that these times can be stressful and upsetting for many people. But we will not and cannot tolerate threats like these against any public officials who are carrying out their duties as efficiently as they can. Protests in Lansing yesterday were led by Michigan United for Liberty, a conservative activist group that has sued Whitmer and organized or participated in several rallies since early April. During a rally last month, some armed protesters entered the Capitol building. Tesh was released from jail on April after posting a bond. He has been placed on a GPS tether. Comment has been sought from his attorney. 'Big Gretch': how the pandemic pushed Michigan governor into the spotlight Updated at BST Mario Koran The Guardian Mario Koran writes in about Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announced that he will donate million for computers and internet access to help close the digital divide in Oakland: Dorsey dropped the news after Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf tweeted a video of one of the estimated students who lack access to the internet. “Every student deserves the ability to learn from home”, wrote Schaaf. The mayor also spotlighted a plan “to close the digital divide for good.” @jack quickly answered the call. Roughly two months into the switch from brick-and-mortar schools to online education, millions of families with school-aged children still remain offline. The need persists even in the shadow of Silicon Valley. As schools shut down, and educators hustled to equip students with devices, the need for internet access was often unmet. Back orders mounted, compounding wait times for unconnected students. The same families without internet often face food scarcity or unstable living conditions — both of which have been exacerbated with businesses closed and parents out of work. Dorsey donation, by itself, won’t be enough to close the digital divide in Oakland. But will certainly help. Schaaf called Dorsey announcement a “game changer”. Updated at BST Long-haul trucking industry website, The Trucker, has a deeply reported look at the truckers’ protest movement , which has been active for days. The protest was thrust into the global spotlight on Friday, when trucker air horns provided a disruptive soundtrack to Donald Trump afternoon press conference. Trump said the horns were a show of support – “They love their president,” he said – but he was wrong. Truckers began a protest in Washington DC at the beginning of the month. They have not received targeted support in any stimulus package and have said they don’t have adequate access to protective equipment and healthcare. They have also voiced serious concerns about the rates they are getting through brokers who connect them with people needing to ship goods. On Wednesday, White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows , met with the protestors for nearly minutes. The Trucker said this gave some people enough hope to return to work, though many also decided to return to work simply because they can’t afford to take more unpaid leave. The Trucker report from Wednesday detailed the meeting with Meadows and Michael Landis, founder and CEO of the United States Transportation Alliance, who acted as a spokesman for the group: Meadows offered his personal email and promised that if Landis puts together a list of priorities and sends it to him, Meadows will act. The wary Landis, who has personally heard years of promises of action from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and others in Washington, responded, “We’d like to hear that from the president.” Meadows was unfazed by the comment and accompanying jeers, responding, “Let me just tell you, having the (president) chief of staff come out with my security detail and everything else is something that really doesn’t normally happen. So, I promise you I’m speaking on behalf of the president of the United States.” Debate is underway for the House stimulus bill – the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act. Members have two hours to discuss the bill, after they spent the morning voting on rules. The bill includes assistance to state and local governments, hazard pay for frontline health care workers, forgiveness of student debt and boosts to the health insurance programs, Medicaid and Medicare. Trump has threatened to veto the bill, but more progressive Democrats have also said they would vote against it. Scenes from the White House press conference A reporter asked McEnany why Donald Trump accused Barack Obama of committing a crime this week and asked McEnany to name the crime. After listing issues with people in office while Obama was president, she said it was reporters responsibility to “answer the question” of what Obama did that was against the law. She ignored the reporter pointing out it is the White House press secretary duty to respond to questions about something the president said. White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany began today White House briefing with a theatrical dismissal of the pandemic plans Barack Obama administration left the Trump White House. McEnany is responding to questions about gaps in the Trump administration readiness by criticizing the Obama administration. A reporter asks about one of today top issues - that the FDA has issued concerns about the type of test kit being used in the White House. McEnany said the issue raised about the kits, false negatives, have been tied to user error and that if people get a negative but are presenting symptoms like fever or coughing, they will be tested again. Never Trump Republicans are holding a rival gathering during the Republican National Convention this year, reports the Washington Post. It will take place in the same city as the RNC – Charlotte, North Carolina – and happen on the same days: The Convention on Founding Principles grew out of an event Trump critics held at the National Press Club this year, concurrent with the Conservative Political Action Conference. Organizers were pleasantly surprised when more than people attended their counter-conference, prompting a move to a larger room. The August event, said McMullin, would more closely resemble an actual political convention. There will be debates and voting on a statement of the attendees’ principles, and a vote on whether they supported a particular candidate for president — presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, or a “well-known third-party candidate.” (Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who is seeking the Libertarian Party nomination for president , has been praised by many anti-Trump conservatives.) Add a new name to the list of possible running mates for Joe Biden. The VoteVets pac has floated Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth as their pick for the vice presidency. Duckworth, a veteran, is the first senator to give birth while in office. “We seem to have this view that paid family leave is some sort of touchy-feely women only policy,” Duckworth told the Guardian in “This isn’t just an entitlement. It really an economic imperative for our nation.” 'We're in the century': Tammy Duckworth on motherhood and the Senate Thanks to Guardian senior politics correspondent, Lauren Gambino , for the tip. Her insights on the Veep race from earlier this month, here: If you would like to experience the sound of a trucker protest , Newsday White House correspondent Laura Figueroa Hernandez has you covered: And NBCNews White House Correspondent, Geoff Bennett, shared a photo of the impressive line-up of trucks near the White House. Donald Trump says he “assumes” the reported coronavirus death toll in the US is accurate. A reporter asked if he was worried it could be higher, and he said “or lower.” But, despite concerns Trump would try and downplay the death toll , he said the number should be accurate. Then, he launched into a tirade against China . “I’d be happier if they were lower... this should never have happened ... this came from China.” Trump is now taking questions from the press. He insisting the US has “no ego” when it comes to vaccine trials and that the US will work with other countries to create a vaccine. Other countries have said this is not happening. A reporter asks if the president is concerned about the Abbott Labs’ coronavirus test, which is being used in the White House but has been reported to show false positives. He says it a “great” test and is not concerned. Trump says he gave his task force the option to where masks, which is why some of them are wearing them and some are not. He noted they are outside and standing at a distance from each other. Truckers disrupt Trump press conference During the president remarks, a low hum can be heard on the video feed. Trump said the sound was truckers “showing support,” but the honking may have actually been a protest . Earlier this month, a convoy of trucks in Washington DC blasted their air horns to protest low shipping rates, which truckers say threaten their livelihoods. The Washington Post covered the protests earlier this month: Just two weeks ago, President Trump had personally extended his gratitude to truckers, welcoming representatives of the industry to the White House and calling truckers “the foot soldiers” in the war against the novel coronavirus . But now, “the American truck driver needs help, and we need it now,” said Santiago, a veteran of the industry from New Jersey. “This is our distress call to our commander in chief to address the problems we are facing. He has called us heroes — his heroes need his help now.” Updated at BST of Newest Oldest Coronavirus outbreak US politics live House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi Donald Trump Andrew Cuomo California Michigan",2064
5,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/anger-in-madrid-but-calm-in-barcelona-at-extended-lockdown,"For the past five days, millions of people in Spain have once again been able to indulge in moments of luxury that would have been mundane routines just two months ago. Across half the country, they have been able to meet up with friends and family, and to sit outside bars and sip a café con leche or a cold, refreshing caña (beer). But not so in Madrid or Barcelona . On Friday the Spanish health ministry denied the Madrid regional government second request to join the of the country in the next phase of relaxation of some of the strictest lockdown measures in Europe . Since it denied permission for such easing last week, people in and around the capital have been unable to meet up or enjoy a physically distanced alfresco drink or meal. The president of the Madrid region, which is governed by the conservative People party (PP), has railed against the ministry decision to leave the area in phase zero. Isabel Díaz Ayuso accused the Socialist-led coalition government on Thursday of “taking advantage of the biggest crisis in Spain recent history to impose a single, dictatorial authority” . Bombastic as her language was, the sentiment has been echoed on the streets of one of Madrid wealthiest and most exclusive barrios . For the past few says, dozens of people in the city Salamanca neighbourhood, where the PP and the far-right Vox party took of the vote in last November general election , have taken to the streets to demand the government resignation and shout, “ ¡Libertad! ” , or “ Freedom!” The protests have raised concerns about the spread of coronavirus in the area of Spain hit hardest by the pandemic. The Madrid region has accounted for of Spain cases to date and of its deaths. The demonstrations have been mocked online using the hashtag #CayeBorroka – a pun on the posh boy name Cayetano and kale borroka , the street-level campaign of violence and vandalism waged in support of the terrorist group Eta in the and The government has defended people right to protest, but called on them to behave responsibly. “Everyone always got the right to protest and even, if only for a short time, to make a lot of loud noise,” the science minister, Pedro Duque, said. “But the only thing we need to be careful about is that we’re in an epidemic situation, and so if you’re protesting, you need to maintain distances to avoid infection.” Things are somewhat calmer in Barcelona, which will also have to wait until at least May to move to phase one. Some rural areas of Catalonia have been given the green light, but health authorities say it is still too soon and too risky to ease many of the restrictions in force in the capital and most of the surrounding province. Alba Vergés, the Catalan health minister, said infection rates were falling throughout the region, but that she was worried more populated areas lacked the resources to follow up new cases and trace contacts. The death rate is proportionately very high in Catalonia. Forty-two per cent of all coronavirus deaths reported in Spain on Friday occurred in the region, down from on Thursday. As a compromise, Vergés has proposed what she called “phase Bar and restaurant terraces would remain closed, travel would be restricted to the municipal area, and groups of or more would not be allowed to meet. Hotels would stay shut. Shops, libraries, open-air markets and places of worship would be permitted to open, but capacity would be limited by physical distancing requirements. Barcelona province is home to nearly five million of the region million inhabitants, most of them concentrated in the towns that ring the capital. L’Hospitalet, home to people to the south-west of Barcelona, has been cited as Europe most densely populated urban area. Despite the lockdown setback, there has been no campaign or pot-banging protests about the decision, and most people appear to accept it with the same equanimity they have shown throughout the crisis. “There just a minority, mostly young people, who aren’t sticking to the rules,” said Maria Eugenia, a Colombian who lives in L’Hospitalet.",696
6,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/mothers-in-labour-pregnant-women-and-babies-were-kabul-gunmens-target-msf,"Gunmen who attacked a maternity hospital in Kabul came “with the purpose of killing mothers in cold blood”, systematically shooting every woman in labour and new mothers they came across, the charity Médecins Sans Frontières has said. The attack on Tuesday morning , aimed at the youngest of children and most vulnerable of women, shocked even a country that has endured decades of bloodshed and tens of thousands of civilian deaths. On Friday a top US official blamed the local Islamic State affiliate for the killings, and urged the Taliban and Afghan authorities to return to peace talks that have been crumbling since the slaughter. MSF, the NGO that has run the maternity unit for six years, has released more details of an assault it described as “four hours of hell”. Perhaps most chilling, is evidence that pregnant women and babies were targets from the start. The gunmen headed straight to the maternity section when they burst into the hospital, even though other buildings and wards were closer to the entrance. “They came to kill the mothers,” sadi Frederic Bonnot, MSF head of programmes in Afghanistan . “They went through the rooms, shooting women in their beds. It was methodical.” Three women were killed in the delivery room, dying shortly before their unborn babies should have drawn their first breaths. Eight were killed in hospital beds, and five others were injured, the charity said in a statement. Ten who found shelter in hospital safe rooms with some staff survived, one giving birth as the attack raged around her. “It shocking. We know this area has suffered attacks in the past, but no one could believe they would attack a maternity [ward],” Bonnet said. The total death toll was including a midwife and two young boys. Two of the babies were also wounded, with one needing emergency surgery in another hospital after being shot in the leg. No group has claimed responsibility, with the Taliban condemning the attack and denying any role. But Afghan authorities and analysts say the militants’ campaign of violence created an “enabling environment” for the attack. In its wake, a US-brokered peace process between the Taliban and Afghan authorities is falling apart. Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, ordered troops back on the offensive from an “active defence” stance adopted to prepare for talks, and the Taliban has ended a de facto urban ceasefire with a truck bomb in the eastern city of Gardez. Zalmay Khalilzad, an American envoy, said on Friday that Islamic State was behind the hospital attack, although the group regional affiliate has not claimed it, and urged the Taliban and Afghan government to put negotiations back on track. “Rather than falling into the Isis trap and delay peace or create obstacles, Afghans must come together to crush this menace and pursue a historic peace opportunity. No more excuses. Afghans, and the world, deserve better,” he said on Twitter. He did not provide any evidence, and the announcement was met with scepticism inside Afghanistan and beyond, where many saw an unseemly rush to get peace talks back on track before the US presidential election. “That is a very quick assessment,” said Saad Mohseni, the director of Moby, Afghanistan largest independent media group. “Afghan intelligence sources, who have a better understanding of issues, have indicated to us that they require more time before they can determine who was behind this massacre. Let not rush into blaming or exonerating any group just yet.” Ahmad Shuja, director general for international affairs on Afghanistan national security council, warned the US risked “normalising murder”. “Sanitising the Taliban image and overlooking their bad behaviour when they’ve taken no actual steps for peace is dangerous,” he said on Twitter . “It doesn’t promote peace. Normalising a group involved in the murders of all our citizens normalises murder. There are better ways to support peace efforts.”",643
7,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/hopes-for-peace-appear-to-be-slipping-away-in-afghanistan,"In the wake of a devastating attack in Kabul on Tuesday on a maternity unit that saw gunmen shoot women in labour, new mothers and their newborn babies, hopes of a peace process for Afghanistan appear to be slipping away as both the government and Taliban ramp up military operations. The Taliban on Thursday attacked a city in Afghanistan east, killing five civilians and at least one soldier, and injuring dozens more with a truck bomb. The bomber had been targeting an army base in Gardez, but the explosives detonated before he reached it, leaving a too-familiar tangle of rubble and bodies. It was the first attack by the Taliban in an urban centre since the group signed a deal with the US in late February agreeing the departure of American troops in return for security guarantees. This was meant to pave the way for intra-Afghan negotiations, but the process was crumbling before talks even began. The militants said Thursday bomb was retaliation for government statements blaming the Taliban for the hospital attack and for president Ashraf Ghani announcement that he had put security forces on the offensive, after months of an “active defence” stance in preparation for the possible peace talks. The Taliban have denied any role in the Kabul attack, which killed and condemned the slaughter. But they also said they were ready to return to the battlefield in full force. “We have the upper hand in the war, we are not tired of war and we are ready,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a radio interview. “When we say the issue should be solved through negotiations, it doesn’t show our weakness.” Senior US officials, heavily invested in the peace process, appeared to urge the Afghan government to accept the Taliban position. The US special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad noted the group denial and called on the Afghan government and Taliban to work together to fight terrorism; US secretary of state Mike Pompeo made similar comments. But even if the Taliban did not dispatch the suicide bombers, their decision to keep up an intense pace of attacks against government forces in recent months – even while the movement was nominally preparing for peace – may have facilitated the violence. “The Taliban have created an enabling environment for this kind of attack. If they had agreed a ceasefire it would be much harder for any group to carry out this kind of attack,” said Kate Clark, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network. “What the Taliban does [with attacks nationwide], takes up the bandwidth of the security services. Also the general insecurity is a sea in which other [militant] groups swim.” Clark added that Taliban intelligence was relatively strong, and had they chosen to stop fighting and focus attention on preventing attacks, they might have been able to stave off violence planned by another group. The peace process had already been faltering over disputes about a prisoner release plan, and Afghan government anger about increased Taliban violence. Even the US had expressed anger about the scale of attacks, saying they violated a secret verbal commitment made on the sidelines of the withdrawal deal. But with the withdrawal of American troops already underway, and presidential elections looming, US officials may feel they have no choice but to try and double down on a peace process they promised Afghans and Americans would be the fruit of their departure, regardless of realities on the ground. “One question that has hung over the process from the start is whether the Taliban had serious intent to talk, and I just don’t think we have seen that,” Clark said. “My fear all along was that there wasn’t really a plan B in Washington, for what happens if the Taliban don’t really want to talk.”",629
8,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/jair-bolsonaro-video-cabinet-foul-mouthed,"The coronavirus pandemic has halted production of Brazil steamy telenovela soap operas – but one small-screen blockbuster is on everyone lips. A two-hour video of a heated and expletive-ridden cabinet meeting chaired by President Jair Bolsonaro last month has become the subject of an extraordinary political arm-wrestle, exposing the intrigues and eccentricities at the centre of Brazilian power. “This meeting is the perfect portrait of the Bolsonaro administration,” said Bruno Boghossian, a columnist for the Folha de São Paulo newspaper in Brazil political capital, Brasília. “Conspiracy theories, ideological issues, made-up battles, and culture wars – all right there at the heart of government.” The video of the supposedly private plenum on April was unexpectedly thrust into the public domain by the resignation of Bolsonaro justice minister, Sergio Moro, two days later. Moro says the images contain key evidence supporting his allegation that Bolsonaro tried to meddle in federal police business and must be released as part of a supreme court investigation into those claims. The footage was privately screened for investigators this week but has yet to be made public. Even before its release, however, the video is casting a profoundly embarrassing, and potentially compromising light on Bolsonaro and the far-right administration he has led since January Bolsonaro claims police are persecuting his family in foul-mouthed rant – reports A partial transcript – produced by the attorney general office on Thursday – and a succession of excruciating leaks offer a tantalising glimpse of the world of paranoia, radicalism and curse words around the leader of the world fourth-largest democracy. “I’m not going to wait for [the federal police] to fuck my family and friends just for shits and giggles,” Bolsonaro fumes at one point, according to the official account, apparently in reference to police inquiries involving his politician sons. Elsewhere Bolsonaro allegedly brands São Paulo governor a “shit”, calls Rio governor “manure” and seems to recognize the chaos engulfing his government, as it faces economic meltdown and a public health crisis that has claimed more than Brazilian lives. On Friday, Bolsonaro government suffered a further blow when his health minsiter resigned less than a month after taking the job. “The ship is sinking,” Bolsonaro is quoted as saying by the Estado de São Paulo during the assembly at the presidential palace. Bolsonaro is not the only person compromised by the footage. Reports suggest his intelligence chief, Gen Augusto Heleno, lambasted the Communist party leaders of Brazil most important trade partner, China, during the encounter. The foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, also reportedly attacked Beijing, accusing it of responsibility for the spread of what he calls the “communavirus”. ( One report this week suggested China ambassador to Brazil had unfollowed Araújo on Twitter because of the alleged comments.) On Wednesday Heleno tweeted that releasing footage containing “confidential and even secret matters” was “an unpatriotic act, almost an attack on national security”. Another cameo reportedly comes from the education minister, Abraham Weintraub. The magazine Veja has reported that during the assembly Weintraub calls for the imprisonment of Brazil supreme court judges and calls his country capital a “cancer” and “crap”. Another outlet, UOL, claimed Weintraub admitted “hating” the expression “indigenous peoples”. “My remarks are republican and polite,” Weintraub said on Twitter this week, adding that he was not in the habit of using blue language. Bolsonaro economy minister, Paulo Guedes, apparently is. On Friday he was reported to have told the meeting the government needed to hurry up and sell “the fucking Bank of Brazil”. The outbursts – coupled with Bolsonaro potentially incriminating remarks about wanting to change the head of Brazil federal police – explain the legal battle currently raging to prevent the video seeing the light of day. Brazil loses second health minister in less than a month as deaths rise Bolsonaro foes, who now include Moro, are demanding its immediate release. But on Thursday the attorney general, Augusto Aras, warned broadcasting the video could provoke “public instability” and spark a “fishing expedition” targeting members of Bolsonaro administration. Boghossian said the government reluctance to release the footage was unsurprising. The images showed a president who was “cornered and surrounded” and a country that was directionless and hostage to “ideological mumbo jumbo”. One supreme court justice was this week reported to have branded the meeting the “reunião de insanos” – an assembly of the insane. “It a pretty apt description,” Boghossian said.",730
9,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/off-the-property-ladder-china-clifftop-villagers-relocated-in-anti-poverty-drive,"Residents from a famous village perched metres up a cliff are among thousands being relocated by the Chinese government into apartment complexes as part of a national poverty alleviation program. Atulie’er village in Sichuan province drew worldwide fame in after images emerged of the residents climbing perilous rattan ladders – some hundreds of years old – up the cliffside to reach their homes. The publicity prompted authorities to replace them with metal ladders, and the village, where the Yi people have lived for generations, soon became a tourist drawcard. Now, households are moving to a newly built housing complex away, state-backed media CGTN reported. About households are believed to be staying behind and working in tourism. “My children won’t need to climb up and down the cliff for education any more,” Atulie’er resident Mose Labo told CGTN. “My wife is pregnant with our third child, moving here makes it very convenient for us to go to the hospital for examination.” The new community was built as part of Xi Jinping target to eliminate poverty by and is expected to house about relocated people in total. Schools and hospitals are also being built, according to the report. The furnished housing is likely to have been subsidised, according to the BBC , and China Daily reports each individual must pay yuan for the move. Leo Lan from Chinese Human Rights Defenders questioned whether Chinese authorities had considered the need to take care of the extra financial, social and cultural burdens of the relocated residents. “It may seem to be doing good for the villagers to move to the urban areas, but the consequences can be difficult for them,” he told the Guardian. “The financial burden of living in urban cities is huge for people coming from poor villages.” Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, said it was unclear whether there was adequate consultation with the Atulie’er residents, and “the Chinese government has a history of carrying out coercive relocation and rehousing programs, especially in minority areas”. “It important for authorities to have meaningful, transparent consultation with affected groups of people, and community concerns are taken into account in such government anti-poverty projects.”",363
10,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/mexico-adulterated-alcohol-deaths-over-100-coronavirus,"More than Mexicans have died from drinking adulterated alcohol over the past month in a string of mass poisonings which followed a ban on the sale of liquor during the pandemic. Deaths from unsafe alcohol have been reported in at least four states. On Thursday, health officials in the central state of Puebla said the death toll there had reached after a batch of moonshine was tainted with methanol – a wood alcohol which can cause blindness and kidney damage. The deaths in Puebla occurred in several municipalities across the rugged Sierra Madre Oriental mountains, a region where “moonshining is kind of a sport”, said Rodolfo Soriano-Núñez, a sociologist who has worked in the region. At least people died in the corn-farming village of Chiconcuautla after consuming cheap home-brewed liquor on Mother Day, according to the municipal government and a local official. The drink – known as “ refino ”, made from sugarcane – is thought to have originated in the neighbouring community of Zacatlán, which is famed for its cider. No arrests have been made. Liquor sales have been banned in some states and municipalities since the start of the pandemic, provoking a rampant black market for bootleg alcohol. “We presume that because of a shortage and a very high demand, some people are trying to sell methanol,” said Denis Santiago Hernández, director of sanitary risks in western Jalisco state. At least seven people died earlier this month in the southern state of Yucatán after drinking an unidentified liquor. “It smelled of alcohol, but it was really dirty, sort of a yellowish colour,” a survivor told Televisa . Mexico consumer watchdog has issued repeated warnings over the dangers of adulterated alcohol, which is often peddled in nightclubs and tourist spots with all-you-can-drink promotions. An association of small merchants warned last year that of all liquor sold in the country was either contraband or adulterated. Much of Mexico has also run out of beer after brewing was declared a non-essential activity during the pandemic. 'There absolutely nothing': locked-down Mexico grapples with national beer shortage Such is the thirst for beer that a recent sighting of white smoke billowing from the Modelo brewery in Mexico City prompted a wave of speculation that the beer drought might soon be over. The company said, however, that the smoke was caused by routine maintenance and that production was not set to resume. Mexico has outlined plans to reopen its economy in steps, starting on May in municipalities without serious contagion and June most other parts of the country.",424
11,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/flying-long-haul-during-covid-19-air-travel-has-never-been-stranger,"hen I booked my flight home after spending more than two-and-a-half months in Europe, I knew what my journey would entail. With no more direct flights between Paris and Hong Kong, I would have a brief layover in London. I knew that when I landed at the Hong Kong airport, I would be tested and held at a facility for roughly eight hours until my results came back. In the best case scenario – if I were negative – I would be spending two weeks in home quarantine, my whereabouts tracked by an app and a chunky device worn on my wrist. If I were positive, I would be sent to the hospital. I’m used to traveling alone, but I wasn’t expecting the feeling of isolation as I moved from one dystopian scene to another. Flying long haul has never been stranger. 'Confusion reigns': life inside Hong Kong coronavirus quarantine centres Heathrow, like Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport, was eerily quiet. I was alone when I went through security. All of the shops and restaurants were closed, there was no music or boarding announcements, and none of the usual din of tens of thousands of passengers making their way to their gates. Looking at the handful of flights listed on the announcement board, I realised that I could safely assume that any other passenger I encountered in the terminal was on my flight. Once we had all boarded, the captain remarked over the PA system that there were only about passengers and that we would all be entering a quarantine of some sort when we landed. He didn’t expect any delays; the skies were empty. When you fly from one international hub to another in normal life, you never know where your fellow passengers are coming from, where they’re going, or what they’ll be doing when they land. But this time – with Hong Kong allowing only residents in – I knew that we had all chosen to return, for one reason or another, and to accept what came next. Hong Kong, despite tens of millions crossing its border with mainland China every year, has only had cases of and four related deaths in a city of million. Until Wednesday, when a woman with no recent travel history was confirmed to be infected, every single new case that Hong Kong had recorded in the previous days had been imported from abroad – meaning none of the patients had caught the virus within the city itself. The British Airways staff member who greeted us on the plane and directed us to our seats wore a mask and gloves, but for the remainder of the journey, the rest of the crew did not. In absurd contrast, some of the passengers wore full-body protective suits, plastic face shields, goggles and gloves. Every single one wore a face mask. The passengers were calm, with none of the usual stressed urgency of air travel: no one was in a hurry to get anywhere. Inside the confines of the plane, it was as if passengers and cabin crew functioned in parallel universes: flight attendants served food and drink as normal – an act impossible to perform without being at least within an arm reach – to people wearing levels of protection normally reserved for highly dangerous environments. Arriving in Hong Kong When we landed in Hong Kong hours later, people were patient and cooperative, though they politely kept their distance from each other. We were all being treated as we were potentially infected. There was the sense that we all knew that we were traveling under extraordinary circumstances and everyone was doing their best to do their part. We were herded through station after station, each with its own discrete purpose. At one, we got health forms and orders. Before we could advance, we had to download a tracking app. At another, someone recorded our phone numbers and checked that they worked. Someone gave us our tracking bracelets, and someone else activated them. A health official signed and stamped my quarantine order and gave me a thermometer, explaining I was to record my temperature twice a day. He told me not to worry, and assured me that assuming I were negative, I would be eating dim sum on the morning of the I went through immigration, picked up my luggage and cleared customs. But I wasn’t heading home. We were herded onto a bus that took us to a convention centre nearbythat had been converted into a testing facility. We stood in line – separated by at least a metre from one another – and a health worker gave us testing kits as well as tag numbers to wear around our necks. She patiently explained how to perform the test on myself. Afterwards, we had to watch an instructional video in a giant hall, where the video played on repeat on three large screens in front of dozens of equally spaced chairs. In the next hall, I was assigned a testing booth, where I could hock up saliva from deep in my throat – the government video instructed us to make a “kruuua” sound – and spit into a tube in semi-privacy. I handed it in and was taken to a hall where I was given my own table and chair, with a welcome note, “house rules” and a rubbish bag. Later, a food cart brought sandwiches and water bottles. As the hours passed, the food cart came by again with chocolate digestives and crackers. Seven hours later, they finally announced that passengers from my flight would be released. Our tag numbers were called. I went up to the counter and was told my test came back negative. I was given a second test kit, which I am to perform on myself again in days. I was free to go home, where I have to stay for the next two weeks.",985
12,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-death-toll-right-denies-figures,"As Donald Trump agitates for the US to reopen, the American right appears to have found a novel way to deal with the rising coronavirus death toll: deny it altogether. 'Obamagate': Fox News focuses on conspiracy theory rather than Top Trump officials, huddled in the White House, itself the subject of a coronavirus outbreak, have according to reports begun questioning the number of deaths – and the president is among the skeptics. It a handy thought process for an administration desperate to send Americans back to work even as deaths from the virus rise each day, with marked surges in some traditionally Republican states. Trump is said to be coming round to the idea, pushed in the rightwing media for weeks, that hospitals, coroners and medical professionals across the US have been mislabelling deaths. As far back as early April, Fox News personalities were casting doubt on the number of people who had succumbed to Senior political analyst Brit Hume led the charge, suggesting fatalities in New York City – the worst-hit area in the country – were “inflated” because the city did not “distinguish between those who die with the disease and those who die from it”. Hume retweeted a chart showing that many people who died had pre-existing conditions. Hume repeated the claim on Tucker Carlson show. He appeared to convince Carlson , who suggested “there may be reasons that people seek an inaccurate death count” and added: “When journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda, unfortunately.” Trump is said to be questioning whether the death toll is lower than officially stated. He has stopped short of saying so in public, but in April he retweeted a man who mused of Democrats : “Do you really think these lunatics wouldn’t inflate the mortality rates by underreporting the infection rates in an attempt to steal the election?” Trump has consistently under-predicted how many people will die from the virus. In February he said there would soon be “close to zero” cases. On April , he suggested to could die. The US passed that figure nine days later. More than have now died . In fact, epidemiologists including Dr Anthony Fauci, the government top public health expert, say more people have died from coronavirus than has been reported. But it a struggle to find similar perspectives in the rightwing media upon which many Americans rely. At the start of May, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized the addition of presumptive coronavirus deaths to the official tolls. “Ahh, retrospectively adding deaths to the Covid count,” she said. “No issues there, I’m sure. No issues with accuracy.” More than deaths were added to the record in New York City in April, as the official figures had not included people who died at home or those who exhibited symptoms of the coronavirus but were not tested for it. Testing kits were particularly difficult to come by in March and early April. The list of people pushing the death toll non-scandal reads like a who who of conspiracy theorists. Alex Jones, the InfoWars host, is a keen proponent of the concept, as are Diamond and Silk , Trump sycophants recently axed by Fox Nation. One common claim is that hospitals receive more money from Medicare if they are treating a patient with the coronavirus compared with other illnesses, and so are inflating their numbers. Scott Jensen, a Minnesota state senator and family physician, began hawking this theory in early April, leading to an appearance on Ingraham show. “Right now Medicare has determined that if you have a admission to the hospital, you’ll get paid Jensen said. “If that patient goes on a ventilator, you get three times as much. Nobody can tell me after years in the world of medicine that sometimes those kinds of things [don’t] impact on what we do.” Jensen appeared to be accusing hospitals of fraud – something he later denied – but the idea stuck. Factcheckers have found no evidence to support Jensen claims – in fact, some hospital revenues are expected to be down, due to the cancellation of elective procedures – but the idea of labeling illnesses as coronavirus for cash became a talking point on rightwing Facebook groups and beyond. Worryingly, the disinformation push seems to be working. An Axios-Ipsos poll found that the death toll has become a political issue, of Republicans believing fewer Americans are dying from coronavirus than the official toll says. A separate study , published at the end of April, revealed the stark consequences of prominent figures underplaying the impact of A group of researchers tracked the spread of coronavirus among viewers of Sean Hannity Fox News show, after Hannity spent weeks downplaying the threat. “Greater exposure to Hannity,” the researchers wrote, “leads to a greater number of cases and deaths.”",803
13,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/the-budget-has-given-new-zealand-an-opportunity-it-cant-afford-to-squander,"ith the economic storm of the pandemic raging on, the government has opened the umbrella to shield New Zealand from an even worse economic fate and set the foundation for its recovery. Although the finance minister, Grant Robertson, has accepted that the government can’t save every job, Thursday announcements show he is doing everything he can to save as many as possible. Overall, New Zealand budget was one of the most comprehensive economic packages seen around the world, walking the fine line between responding to the crisis and keeping up economic momentum, while setting down the conditions for recovery and rebuilding. Front and centre of many policies were jobs – and rightly so, given more than Kiwi workers have lost theirs in recent weeks. This focus on jobs – keeping them, training for them, and finding more of them – has seen sizeable investments. A extension of the wage subsidy was a critical policy to stem the tide of unemployment and will keep more Kiwis in work as we approach the more upbeat period of spring. However, businesses will be feeling left out, with cashflow issues still persistent and no substantial support being offered to offset low revenues. New Zealand budget: Robertson lays out plan to return jobs to levels The government has also taken the opportunity to begin addressing other issues, while at the same time boosting employment. The for nature-based jobs is designed to help restore the environment and add jobs. Substantial increases to healthcare funding will support work and also build resilience in an area in need of more. Additional state houses will be built, getting a roof over the heads of more vulnerable Kiwis and also keeping local builders paid. And more will be invested in New Zealand ageing and underfunded infrastructure , hopefully addressing deficits that have started to threaten safe drinking water and led to faecal contamination of our waterways. More will be needed to fully address these issues completely, but it a smart start to support workers and address other issues. The most impressive announcement from the budget was the focus on education. The pandemic and resulting economic downturn means that the structure of the economy will change, and our workers will need to change with it. The investment in education and training gives Kiwis who will lose jobs the change to re-skill themselves for emerging job opportunities, with targeted funding for trades training and apprenticeships giving Kiwis out of a job to prepare for a new career. Education will be critical moving forward, particularly for New Zealand young people. Jobseeker figures from the ministry of social development highlight that job losses have disproportionately hit youth, and the need to provide retraining has never been so important. Yet there is one glaring omission from the budget, one that has come about as Robertson has sought to strike a balance between action and adaptability. The budget lacks a solid plan moving forward, which reflects the still uncertain circumstances we find ourselves in. But as the costs of government policies rise, a roadmap for recovery becomes a pressing issue. Businesses are looking to assess where to invest and who to train. Households are looking to find jobs and where to spend. A clear strategy is needed for what a redeveloped New Zealand looks like, including more emphasis placed on digital connectivity and skills, and a renewed focus on our ability to export. It remains clear is that New Zealand economy remains inextricably linked to global fortunes. Our exports are holding up, as the world needs to eat. New Zealand continues to provide a range of high-quality, safe, and premium products to households the world over. Yet as the globe edges into recession, the way we trade has changed too. In focusing on our local economy, New Zealand can’t forget the wider world we operate in and get paid by. Additional investment in exporter support is a good first step. To achieve all these policies costs money, and the government hasn’t hesitated to write a big cheque to get New Zealand moving. Debt levels will soar, more than doubling to over With less money coming in as fewer people are employed, combined with higher unemployment payments and rising support spending, the government will remain in the red for a long time. Taking on debt at times like this is the right, but painful, thing to do. Essentially, New Zealand is spending the pandemic insurance we’ve amassed over recent decades by keeping government debt low. Going fast and going hard has put New Zealand in the enviable position of being able to reopen the economy without risking lives, and at a faster pace than anywhere else in the world. And to pay for our recovery, we’re essentially taking out another mortgage out against the New Zealand economy. With all this borrowing, and the resulting investment on getting Kiwis back into work, the budget has set the foundation for economic recovery. But the work doesn’t end here – we need to construct a plan for the future, and ensure that we don’t squander the position we’ve worked so hard to put ourselves in.

14,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/weird-hell-professor-advent-calendar-covid-19-symptoms-paul-garner,"In mid-March Paul Garner developed what he thought was a “bit of a cough”. A professor of infectious diseases, Garner was discussing the new coronavirus with David Nabarro, the UK special envoy on the pandemic. At the end of the Zoom call, Nabarro advised Garner to go home immediately and to self-isolate. Garner did. He felt no more than a “little bit off”. Days later, he found himself fighting a raging infection. It one he likens to being “abused by somebody” or clubbed over the head with a cricket bat. “The symptoms were weird as hell,” he says. They included loss of smell, heaviness, malaise, tight chest and racing heart. At one point Garner thought he was about to die. He tried to Google “fulminating myocarditis” but was too unwell to navigate the screen. Garner refers to himself wryly as a member of the “Boris Johnson herd immunity group”. This is the cluster of patients who contracted in the days before the UK finally locked down. He assumed his illness would swiftly pass. Instead it went on and on – a rollercoaster of ill health, extreme emotions and utter exhaustion, as he put it in a blog last week for the British Medical Journal . There is growing evidence that the virus causes a far greater array of symptoms than was previously understood. And that its effects can be agonisingly prolonged: in Garner case for more than seven weeks. The professor at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine says his experience of featured a new and disturbing symptom every day, akin to an “advent calendar”. He had a muggy head, upset stomach, tinnitus, pins and needles, breathlessness, dizziness and arthritis in the hands. Each time Garner thought he was getting better the illness roared back. It was a sort of virus snakes and ladders. “It deeply frustrating. A lot of people start doubting themselves,” he says. “Their partners wonder if there is something psychologically wrong with them.” Since his piece was published, Garner has received emails and tearful phone calls from grateful readers who thought they were going mad. “I’m a public health person,” he says. “The virus is certainly causing lots of immunological changes in the body, lots of strange pathology that we don’t yet understand. This is a novel disease. And an outrageous one. The textbooks haven’t been written.” According to the latest research, about one in Covid patients experience long-term on-off symptoms. It unclear whether long-term means two months, or three or longer. The best parallel is dengue fever , Garner suggests – a “ghastly” viral infection of the lymph nodes which he also contracted. “Dengue comes and goes. It like driving around with a handbrake on for six to nine months.” Prof Tim Spector, of King College London, estimates that a small but significant number of people are suffering from the “long tail” form of the virus. Spector is head of the research group at King College London which has developed the tracker app . This allows anyone who suspects they have the disease to input their symptoms daily; some to million people are currently using it, mostly Britons and Americans. Spector estimates that about of them are reporting symptoms which have lasted for the duration of the study, which is six weeks. There is good clinical data available for patients who end up in hospital. Thus far the government is not collecting information on those in the community with ostensibly “mild” but often debilitating symptoms – a larger group than those in critical care. “These people may be going back to work and not performing at the top of their game,” Spector says. “There is a whole other side to the virus which has not had attention because of the idea that ‘if you are not dead you are fine.’” He adds: “We are the country that invented epidemiology. We haven’t produced any epidemiological studies other than the app. It kind of embarrassing.” As more information becomes available, the government Covid model seems increasingly out of date. Many Covid patients do not develop a fever and cough. Instead they get muscle ache, a sore throat and headache. The app has tracked different types of symptoms, together with a distinct pattern of “waxing and waning”. “I’ve studied diseases. Covid is the strangest one I have seen in my medical career,” Spector says. Scientific explanations for what is happening are still at an early stage. Lynne Turner-Stokes, professor of rehabilitation medicine at King College, says Covid is a “multi-system disease” which can potentially affect any organ. It causes microvascular problems and clots. Lungs, brain, skin, kidneys and the nervous system may be affected. Neurological symptoms can be mild (headache) or severe (confusion, delirium, coma). Turner-Stokes says it uncertain why the illness is sometimes so protracted. One explanation is that the body immune system goes into overdrive, with an ongoing reaction. Another is that the symptoms are virus-driven. Either way, she says there can be a “recrudescence of symptomatology”. Or, as she also puts it using more colloquial language, “the whole caboodle comes back”. Researchers are now collaborating across borders. They are examining the latest data from European countries ahead of the UK in pandemic terms, such as Italy and Spain, as well as China. They are seeking to work out what support may be needed for severe and chronic patients, with Covid posing similar challenges to HIV/Aids a generation ago. Meanwhile Covid “long-termers” have been comparing notes via a Slack support group. It has and chat groups. The dominant feeling is relief that others are in the same grim situation, and that their health problems are not imaginary.",941
15,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools,"The British Medical Association has thrown its weight behind teaching unions opposing the government push to reopen schools in England, as the debate over millions of pupils returning to classrooms grew increasingly acrimonious. No reinforced its drive to reopen primary schools for those in reception, year and year in two weeks’ time, warning that prolonged closures risked damaging children education. But the BMA – the UK largest doctors’ union – said in a letter to the National Education Union on Friday that the number of coronavirus infections remained too high to allow them to run safely. Teaching unions had been “absolutely right” to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on June. “We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK,” the BMA council chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in the letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney. Reopening schools is a dangerous move | Letters The BMA said there was conflicting evidence from scientific studies on the effect of reopening schools, citing the “relatively small amount of research available and the uncharted territory we find ourselves in”. Nagpaul concluded: “Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools.” Meanwhile, Liverpool became the first local authority to rule out reopening its schools until at least June, in a significant blow to the government. Liverpool move may encourage other local authorities to follow suit. With most state primary schools still maintained by councils, that could mean many schools missing the government June target. Liverpool city council maintains primary schools. Some academy chains have said they will go ahead on June, however. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis multi-academy trust, which runs more than primary schools, called the opposition to reopening “rather middle-class” and accused teachers’ unions of failing to recognise the harm being done to disadvantaged children. In the face of scepticism from teachers and school leaders, the government has increasingly raised the stakes in recent days. The education secretary for England, Gavin Williamson, wrote in the Daily Mail that teachers should be ready to “do their duty” and cooperate with the government efforts. Boris Johnson official spokesman said: “Safety comes first, but we must also be aware of the potential damage to a child education from not getting them back in the classroom.” Part of the government effort to win over the sector saw it hold a large virtual meeting on Friday between education leaders from colleges, schools and nurseries and top medical and scientific advisers, including Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Patrick Vallance, the UK government chief scientific adviser. But union leaders said they were “left with more questions than answers” after the meeting, which some participants said was at times confusing and chaotic, with around people and organisations taking part. Some complained that their questions were not answered. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the evidence presented to the meeting was “flimsy at best” but that there was room for further discussion. “This was never in our minds a make-or-break meeting, that was never its purpose. It for the government to demonstrate that the scientific advice is there, and then it for schools and government to demonstrate that schools will be safe for reopening, from whatever date,” Roach said. “It vitally important that the government and employers are behaving reasonably. It disappointing that many of the questions that we put to the scientific advisers this afternoon haven’t yet been answered. We hope that they will be answered – our members are hoping they will be answered. “The government has got to win the confidence of the profession, and it got to win public confidence as well, if parents are going to entrust their children into schools where there is a risk of greater transmission of the virus.” The NEU Courtney welcomed Vallance pledge to publish the papers presented to the Sage group of government advisers relating to education. But he also said the scientific advice presented to the meeting appeared mixed, and he was surprised to learn of instances in Australia where children had carried coronavirus cases into their households as “index cases”. “The things that they told us didn’t give me confidence that we should be going ahead without the social distancing and measures that schools in other countries have. It really not clear what the government test is to reopen schools,” Courtney said. The governments in Wales and Scotland remain unmoved by Westminster decision to reopen schools. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland first minister, said: “There will be no cavalier approach to any aspect of this on the part of the Scottish government. “It is not going to be the case that schools are back to normal in any way, shape or form this side of the summer holidays. We are of course discussing if it is possible for any pupils to be back in that timescale. But if it is, it is likely to be on a very limited basis.” Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, also said no date had been set for schools there to reopen. But she announced the publication of a working document to stimulate discussion over how to reopen. “Setting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do,” Williams said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said at Friday Downing Street press conference: “I wouldn’t support a proposal to start to reopen schools unless it was safe to do so, and it is safe to do so.” He added: “In the same way that it terrible news that this virus impacts on the elderly so much, the good news is that it seems to spare children in almost every case. And so the the risk to children is much, much lower than to any other age group – certainly if you don’t have underlying health conditions.” The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said the falling number of cases across the community would reduce the risks further in coming weeks. “There a lot of anxiety I think around this, but people need to think through, in an average infant school of maybe children, the likelihood of anybody having this disease is very small, and diminishing with time, so we just need to keep that in perspective.” Williamson said: “Getting children back to school is vital for their educational development and many schools are already taking steps to welcome back their pupils. I am grateful for their support.”",1100

Regardless of the wisdom of such moves, it clear that there a desire to return to something resembling normalcy across the country, as in Wisconsin , where locals returned to packed bars this week. Model companions: restaurant solves social distancing dilemma with mannequins How many of those revelers there, and in other states like Texas with lax policies, may contract the virus remains to be seen, but a recent viral video from Japan gives an idea of how easily the infection might spread. The video experiment, conducted by the public broadcaster NHK in conjunction with disease specialists, uses blacklight and a fluorescent substance to simulate how quickly germs can be spread across a variety of surfaces in environments such as restaurant buffets and cruise ships. To begin with, one guest of at a restaurant buffet is shown with the substance on his hands meant as a stand-in for the coronavirus. Over the course of a typical dining period, the rest of the guests behave in predictable fashion, selecting utensils from serving stations, enjoying their food, checking their phones and so on. At the end of the experiment the backlight is turned on and the substance is revealed to be smeared everywhere: plates, foodstuff, utensils and even all over some of the guests’ faces. A second experiment in the same environment showed the benefits of improved hygiene techniques. The “infected” person and the other diners washed their hands before and throughout the meal, and utensils and other implements were cleaned and replaced more frequently. “What the video demonstrated, is that it will spread to surfaces and to people very efficiently,” John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at Hong Kong University, told CNN. “I think it really highlights the need of what people have been saying about hand hygiene to stop the spread of disease.”",323

An R value above means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which wold result in a second wave of cases. The latest data from Sage is based on the levels of transmission from two to three weeks ago, calling into question whether England should be easing its lockdown restrictions just yet. More than a quarter of all care home deaths in England and Wales since the beginning of the crisis involved data from the ONS revealed. In the period from March to May, there were registered deaths of care home residents in England and Wales, of which involved the virus . All care home residents and staff in England will be tested for by early June, the health secretary announced. It came as Matt Hancock outlined plans for a funding boost for the social care sector, after the government came under fierce criticism this week for acting too slowly to contain the spread of the virus in care homes. The Welsh government published its roadmap for easing the lockdown in Wales, keeping the ‘stay home’ message in place for another two weeks. The traffic light system will move from lockdown into the “first cautious step” of the red zone, then the amber zone, and finally the green zone. The traffic light categories will apply to different aspects of daily life and activities, which may well happen at different rates. Schools in Wales will not fully reopen before September, Mark Drakeford confirmed. But he said the ambition remained for some cohorts of children to return to school before the summer holidays. Transport for London is to raise the congestion charge by to secure a government bailout after it took a hit to its revenue due to the pandemic. The capital congestion charge of will be reimposed from Monday, as will the separate charge imposed on vehicles with high emissions entering central London.

Coronavirus live news: Europe could face deadly second wave of winter infections, WHO warns Q. What does the government intend to do to ease the double pressures on businesses in Northern Ireland impacted by the lockdown and by pending Brexit border checks? Hancock says the government intends to deliver on the referendum result. Q. Given that the devolved regions are now leaving lockdown at different rates and with different R rates, will you be advising measures such as temperature checks at ports and airports for people travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK? Harries says there may be times when differential policies will have to apply, whether that within England or between the different countries of the UK. This will come as we gather more evidence on the different populations, she adds. She adds that temperature checks for isn’t a very valid intervention because of the incubation period. That the end of the press conference. Q. Some care homes are not telling residents and their families how many infections and deaths with coronavirus they have had, should that be made publicly available? Hancock says he didn’t know about this and would like to look into it. Transparency is the best forward, he says. Harries adds that some care homes are very small, so we need to be careful about disclosing clinical information. She adds that it isn’t always easy to pinpoint the overriding cause of death. Q. Do you think the prime minister should correct what he said in parliament, given that the only directive on a ban on care home visits came on April, ten days after the national lockdown? Hancock says that on March, extra guidance was introduced, after which many care home providers stopped visitors. This guidance was strengthened “all along”, he adds. He then moved swiftly on. The question referred to Boris Johnson claim during PMQs that it “wasn’t true” that as late as March the care home sector had been advised that it was unlikely to face an outbreak. Labour has asked for the prime minister to return to the Commons to correct the record. PMQs: Keir Starmer presses Boris Johnson over care home deaths Q. What does the government consider an acceptable level of risk when it comes to reopening schools? Q. What consequences would schools face if they refuse to reopen because the risk is too great? Hancock says reopening schools has to be “a team effort” and accepts it a “huge challenge”. Kanani says that risk is relative; the government wouldn’t send children back unless it was safe to do so, which is why it will be phased and careful. Harries adds the risk should be kept in perspective. The likelihood of anyone having the disease by the time schools do reopen will be diminished. There are longer term health risks of not getting a good education, she adds. Q. Lots of very vulnerable people in care homes who are under the age of with multiple health conditions and problems and also those with learning disabilities can’t apply for tests on the portal [it currently only only open to those over and those with dementia] – why have they been left out? Hancock acknowledges that those in care homes who are working age and are clinically vulnerable need support. We’re rolling that out, he says. Harries adds there is a very stark variation in risk for the elderly, compared to all other variables. Q. Are people with learning disabilities being put at the back of the queue? Hancock says the government is following the clinical advice on individual risks in terms of applying testing capability. Q. Why do you collectively appear quite relaxed that the R rate is up today, and the latest R rate suggests transmission of the disease might not be reducing? Will you reconsider the timetable for lifting England lockdown? Hancock says the R is based on data from several weeks ago so there is a lag, but it is still an important tool for policy makers. The R is still below he adds. Harries adds that R is a very standard way of comparing what happening and is an important measure, but the real outcome we need is a reduction in the number of cases. It not just the R value, it the triangulation of all the evidence we have, she adds. It an important measure but not the only one. Q. On a day when the R is up, are you absolutely confident that allowing an easing of measures ahead of a sunny, warm weekend is the right decision? Hancock says R isn’t above so it still meets the test. People must observe physical distancing measures, he adds. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. Are the measures you set out today too little too late, given the high numbers of deaths of care home residents? Hancock says throughout the crisis the government has supported those in care homes. Kanani adds primary care support for care home residents has been “ramped up” in recent weeks. Q. If the R rate has increased [see ] , are you re-thinking the easing of the lockdown? Hancock says the R is being kept constantly under review. It one of the government five tests to keep the R below he says. Current estimates are that it between and which still meets the test, he adds. Q. Anna from Worthing asks if the government recognises that nursing is a highly skilled profession that deserves better pay. Hancock says it is a highly skilled profession that deserves decent pay. He says pay for nurses went up last year. He adds that as health secretary he will “fight to have that fair reward” for nurses. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Q. Susanna from Oxford asks if the government alert level - eradication of coronavirus in the UK - is a realistic target. Harries says it an ambitious target. In global terms, there isn’t an immediate easy outcome to achieve this, she says. Smallpox is the only disease we have eradicated, but having the ambition is good, she says. Understanding antibody response and immunity in the population, treatments and a vaccine are ongoing areas, she says. The immediate effort is to reduce the number of cases, she adds. The number of deaths confirmed with a positive test across all settings is steadily decreasing, Harries says. London had a severe and sharper rise in hospitalisations, this is coming down now, Harries says. Across the UK, the numbers are flattening off, she says, but we need to continue adhering to physical distancing measures to make good progress. Hospital admissions are falling but it is a “slow, careful” downward trend, so must continue to observe physical distancing, Harries says. Testing is on the rise, with positive cases recorded in the last hours, Harries says. Despite the rise in testing and increased likelihood of finding new cases, the number of new cases is continuing to come down, she says. of Newest Oldest Coronavirus outbreak Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Infectious diseases",1622
18,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/regional-differences-in-covid-19-transmission-rate-emerge-in-england,"Transmission rates of remain dangerously close to levels that could bring a second wave, even before the easing of some restrictions this week, as the focus shifts to transmission rates in the north of England. The latest official estimate places the national R value – the rate at which people are passing on infections to others – at between and An R value above means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. It raises questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in coming weeks. In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: “We have the R below between and – but potentially only just below The slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago. A likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes. The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing. It comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of appear to be falling far less steeply. Some epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time. There is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as “frankly, madness”. The leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to “stay at home” would continue. Gannon, whose views on lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, said there was evidence that the R rate was greater than in his borough. How do models calculate the R value? The R value tells you how many infections each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. For an R above the epidemic increases exponentially; below it will eventually fizzle out. In the absence of direct measures of this elusive number, modellers have to rely on what firm data we have and extrapolate from there. Some models, such as one by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University , rely on the numbers of reported deaths, and the steep, steady decline in deaths in London translates into an estimate that community transmission must have also rapidly dropped off. Deaths are reliable figures, less subject to biases than some other measures, but they reflect the infection rates that were occurring about three weeks previously and so do not give a dynamic reflection of where things are. Policy changes around working and socialising introduced in the past week may have influenced R, but a model based on deaths will not give any insights into this. The PHE model projected that there might be as few as new cases in the capital per day on May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics. On Thursday, people with new infections were admitted to hospitals in London. Some models rely on measures such as symptoms reported to phone apps, which have a shorter lag time. However, these data are more “noisy” and so give a less robust measure of R overall, although they can give better insight into short-range changes. How sure are we about regional differences? Almost all available data and models suggest there are strong regional differences in terms of the number of infections and current transmission rates. Serology surveys suggest that more than of people in London have been infected with compared with around in the rest of the country. In general, urban centres have had more infections than rural areas. The data from hospital admissions and deaths also suggest that R has come down far more steeply in London than in other regions. The PHE and Cambridge model suggests that R in London is compared with in the north-east and Yorkshire and for the country as a whole. This is one of a handful of models feeding into advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to government, and all are showing broadly similar patterns across the regions. However, the extent of the differences varies, meaning that an optimistic estimate for London cannot be relied on too heavily. Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, described the PHE/Cambridge estimate for London as “extremely low”. His own team predictions put the London R value closer to “This still predicts a faster decline in London than the rest of the country, but not as dramatic … The difference between and might sound like scientists arguing over small details, but these translate to very substantial differences in the rate of decline of cases, or the time for the epidemic to halve,” he said. What are the reasons for regional differences? Initially, London was a few weeks ahead of other regions of the country because far more infections were seeded there at the start of the epidemic. However, it has also seen a steeper decline and, in fact, may have always had a slightly lower community transmission rate than some other geographical regions. There are likely to be a wide range of factors behind this. London may now have a higher level of population immunity, which could be playing a role in bringing down transmission, since a higher proportion of people have been infected. “If it turns out that there loads of immunity in the community, then that brilliant, but I don’t think we should plan for that scenario,” said Thomas House, reader in mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester. “We don’t really know yet.” There are also likely to be substantially different contributions from hospitals and care homes, where transmission rates have not been effectively brought under control. In some regions, the spread of infection in these settings, where lockdown does not have the same impact, could be making a major contribution to keeping R close to Differences in living arrangements – for instance, larger family groups living together outside London – could play a role. Models may also not fully capture the role of underlying health issues and deprivation in raising the risk of severe cases. Is there evidence that people in some regions have complied less with the lockdown? There isn’t strong evidence for this. The lockdown has brought down transmission rates in the community across the country, and a forthcoming study from scientists at Imperial College London does not seem to suggest that London has been an outlier in terms of compliance. “The uniformity with which the UK responded to the lockdown is remarkable,” said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics. “I thought maybe people in London who were close to a large epidemic would be much more compliant than elsewhere. But the behaviour change was very well synchronised across the UK.” Do the models suggest restrictions should be eased regionally? This is an emerging view among scientists. “Based on just the epidemiology, it makes a tremendous amount of sense,” said House. “There no point locking down if there no cases to prevent.” However, he and others acknowledge that the political decision will be weighted by factors beyond simply modelling the trajectory of case numbers. “It much more difficult to message the relaxation than it is to message the lockdown,” said Riley. “I suspect the most difficult aspect on possible regional differences is how you would message it. That uncertainty would be much greater than any mechanistic modelling uncertainty.”",1375

20,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-the-week-explained,"elcome to our weekly roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As new cases emerged in countries that relaxed their restrictions and businesses struggled to weather the storm, the World Health Organization warned that the disease may never go away. Vaccine hopes and fears An experimental vaccine that is being given to hundreds of people in an accelerated trial has passed an important milestone. A single shot of the Oxford University vaccine was found to protect a small number of monkeys from serious coronavirus infections. The six animals who received the jab produced antibodies to the virus within a month which appeared to prevent lung damage caused by the virus. The virus was still active in the nose, according to a preliminary report posted on the bioRxiv preprint server. The news came days after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, conceded that there was no guarantee a vaccine would work , though his chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, was more upbeat, saying: “I’d be surprised if we didn’t end up with something.” A working vaccine is not enough if rich countries buy up all the shots and leave poorer countries unprotected. As a foretaste of the wrangling to come, Paul Hudson, the head of the French pharma company Sanofi caused an outcry when he told Bloomberg News that the US would have first dibs on any vaccine his firm discovered, since the US had funded much of the research. France minister of higher education, research and innovation, Frédérique Vidal, called the plan “disgraceful”. The Science Weekly podcast asks whether we need more than one vaccine . Hannah Devlin speaks to Prof Andrew Pollard about the work being done by different teams around the world to create a vaccine for and where his team at Oxford University fit into this international effort. Unease over easing Disunity reigned in the UK as England broke ranks from the devolved nations over how to lift the lockdown. Johnson told people to return to work if they couldn’t work from home, even as the Office of National Statistics revealed that many of those in the PM sights – construction workers, cleaners, bus drivers and retail workers – were the most likely to die from The Trade Union Congress said the move put people health at risk as employers had only “ vague and non-binding ” guidelines on how to protect staff. The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, led a chorus of disapproval and warned that the move was “potentially catastrophic”. Bewildered experts lambasted Johnson for ditching the simple advice to “Stay at Home” for the more puzzling instruction to “ Stay Alert ”. A group of behavioural scientists who were convened to advise the government made it clear the slogan hadn’t come from them. “Who is advising on the current messaging? Unfortunately it not us,” said one. As commuters packed on to trains and buses, David Hunter, a professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, warned that case numbers were not low enough to relax restrictions without risking a second wave of infections. Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, was similarly aghast , warning that without robust systems to test, trace and isolate those infected, the virus could spread through the population unchecked, resulting in “a Darwinian culling of the elderly and vulnerable”. Every African country now affected Health officials in Lesotho announced their first case of coronavirus, meaning the infection has now spread across the entire African continent. The virus was detected in one of people tested after arriving from Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Africa facing a quarter of a billion coronavirus cases, WHO predicts Lesotho went into lockdown on March to prevent the virus spreading from South Africa which entirely surrounds the kingdom and has the most recorded cases on the continent. Trump v Fauci The latest tiff between the US president and Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation leading infectious disease expert, erupted over the speed at which the country is reopening. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made clear that the virus was far from contained a day after Donald Trump declared that the nation had “prevailed” against the epidemic. In evidence to a Senate hearing, Fauci went on to warn of dire consequences if the US opened too soon and urged caution over reopening schools. President Trump did not approve . “To me it not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools,” he told reporters. The president himself is taking no chances though. Staff in the West Wing, the operational centre of Trump administration, have been ordered to wear face masks except when at their own desks. Trump will not be wearing one . One of his valets and vice-president Mike Pence press secretary have both tested positive for the virus.

His comments came as Avianca Holdings, Latin America second biggest airline and one of the oldest in the world, filed for bankruptcy after failing to secure aid from Colombia government and with a bond payment deadline looming. Avianca would be one of the first major airlines to go under as a result of the pandemic which has caused a decline in global air travel. Meanwhile, Ryanair announced it aimed to restart of its services in July under new rules that require passengers to have temperature tests at the airport, wear face coverings, use hand sanitiser in terminals and ask permission to use the toilet .",984
21,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/how-coronavirus-is-reshaping-europe-in-dangerous-ways,"We are still in the early chapters of the story and it too soon to judge the full impact of the pandemic. But one can tentatively discern six negative trends for Europe . These had all emerged before the virus struck but are now accelerating. In various ways they are all likely to help the cause of anti-EU populists: greater economic autarky, stronger borders and more hostility to green policies. Deglobalisation has given extra ammunition to those arguing for greater national or European self-sufficiency. Long before it arrived, there was talk of “deglobalisation” and “reshoring” of supply chains. This stemmed in part from politics: Donald Trump protectionist policies threatened international supply chains, as did the UK pursuit of a hard Brexit. Economics is also important: wage differentials between emerging economies such as China and rich countries are narrowing, reducing the advantages of off-shoring production. EU faces ‘existential threat’ if coronavirus recovery is uneven Now concerns about the security of the supply of drugs , medical equipment and even key components for the car industry , alongside greater suspicion of Chinese companies, have boosted the case for more national or European autonomy of supply chains. Nation-first politics National capitals are gaining more clout vis-a-vis the EU institutions. For decades these institutions have been losing ground to the member states, which resent the powers that Brussels has accumulated. The key capitals assert their authority in hard times. They did it a decade ago during the financial and eurozone crises, when they had to provide the bailout money. Now they have done so again. The European commission has struggled to keep the together and to coordinate their responses to – not only because most of the key powers on health, fiscal policy and frontiers reside at national level, but also because many people look to national leaders to navigate the difficulties. Tighter borders The EU has been strengthening the Schengen zone external border since when numbers of people seeking refuge in Europe first surged in significant numbers. Some governments also introduced checks on borders within the Schengen area. The health emergency has increased suspicion of foreigners and in March the EU Schengen-area countries closed their external border to non-essential travellers. More obstacles to movement within the Schengen area have also sprouted. At some point governments will have got the virus largely under control, but they will then be very wary of softening the Schengen border. Visitors from parts of the world where the disease may still be rampant will not be welcome. Many politicians will want to make life as difficult as possible for irregular migrants. Green backlash The pandemic is likely to strengthen opposition to policies that are designed to moderate the climate crisis and make us live greener lives. Before the virus arrived, populists such as the Sweden Democrats, the AfD in Germany , Nigel Farage in the UK and the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) in France were using hostility to green policies as a means of drumming up support. Many voters whose standards of living are dropping dramatically will not want to take a further hit to jobs and incomes from measures designed to tackle the climate emergency. Europe leaders insist that their plans for curbing carbon emissions are sacrosanct. But as the recession bites, the pressures on them to moderate their green agenda, including from industry , will strengthen. East-west tension For several years an east-west division has left Hungary, Poland and sometimes other central European states at odds with the rest of the EU. They have rowed over the distribution of irregular immigrants, with some eastern countries refusing to take any; targets for reducing carbon emissions, with the easterners tending to depend on coal; and the rule of law, with Poland and Hungary disregarding the independence of the judiciary and media pluralism. has widened the rift. Central Europeans fear that they will lose money from the EU budget to the southern countries most afflicted by the virus. Meanwhile Hungary Viktor Orbán has used the pandemic as a justification for introducing rule by decree , exacerbating fears that he is creating a de facto dictatorship. North-south tension The virus is widening the north-south fissure which emerged in the eurozone crisis years ago. Germany, the Netherlands and their northern allies were reluctant to give substantial help to the southern countries in difficulty. Now the coronavirus has struck the EU asymmetrically. The southern countries, particularly Italy and Spain, have suffered more coronavirus deaths than most others, started the crisis with higher levels of debt and depend on industries such as tourism that are badly affected. They want solidarity from the north, ideally in the form of some sort of “eurobond”: the EU as a whole would borrow money and then disburse grants to the worst-affected countries. EU leaders have agreed to set up a recovery fund to support the worst-affected regions. But this seems likely to provide more in the way of loans than grants, because the northern governments remain opposed to large-scale transfers to the south – although the southerners already have excessive levels of debt. This stinginess is rooted in northern voters’ hostility to transfers. But it delights populists such as Matteo Salvini, in Italy, who is skilled at exploiting every perceived slight from the EU. One recent opinion poll found that of Italians wanted to leave the EU. None of these changes is to be welcomed. If Europe pushes self-sufficiency too far, it will impair the benefits that trade delivers to all continents. Closing frontiers within the Schengen zone or on its borders, once is under control, would achieve very little. And when the EU is faced with transnational challenges such as economic depression, a pandemic or climate change, it needs strong central institutions. EU leaders should not slacken in their efforts to tackle climate change. The east-west rift is alarming and cannot be resolved by tolerating disrespect for the rule of law. As for the north-south divide, the ECB may be able to do enough to keep Italy and other southern member-states in the eurozone. But the politics of an unresolved rift may turn very nasty, increasing anti-EU sentiment across the bloc – and could even trigger a country leaving the EU or the euro.

The rest is part of an awful history still in the making, with spreading from that first cluster in the capital of China Hubei province to a pandemic that has killed about people so far. Stock footage of pangolins – a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater – have made it on to news bulletins, suggesting this animal was the staging post for the virus before it spread to humans. But there is uncertainty about several aspects of the origin story that scientists are trying hard to unravel, including which species passed it to a human. They’re trying hard because knowing how a pandemic starts is a key to stopping the next one. Prof Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne Monash University, says what most likely is that virus originated in bats. But that where his certainty ends, he says. On the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan live animal market from an interaction between an animal and a human, Turner says: “I don’t think it conclusive by any means.” “Part of the problem is that the information is only as good as the surveillance,” he says, adding that viruses of this type are circulating all the time in the animal kingdom. The fact that the virus has infected a tiger in a New York zoo shows how viruses can move around between species, he says. “Understanding the breadth of species this virus can infect is important as it helps us narrow down down where it might have come from.” Scientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another coronavirus – the Sars outbreak – moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans. One animal implicated as an intermediary host between bats and humans is the pangolin. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says they are “the most illegally traded mammal in the world” and are prized for their meat and the claimed medicinal properties of their scales. As reported in Nature , pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it illegal to sell them. “Whether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it not clear,” Turner says. “It either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it jumped into people and evolved in people.” Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a Nature study that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is “ still uncertain ”. One statistical study looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons. Another study claimed to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans. The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human. “Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,” the study said. Analysis of the first patients in medical journal the Lancet found that of them had direct exposure to the Wuhan market. But the same analysis found that the first known case of the illness did not. This might be another reason to doubt the established story. Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental “cannot be ruled out” but that possibility “seems less likely” because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment. Perlman told Guardian Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they “are not proven to be the key intermediary”. “I suspect that any evolution [of the virus] occurred in the intermediate animal if there was one. There has been no substantial changes in the virus in the three months of the pandemic, indicating that the virus is well adapted to humans.” So-called wet markets – where live animals are traded – have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses , in particular Sars. Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on origins have stepped off from what was known from the past. But “we really don’t know” how accurate the origin story is, she says: “There some sort of connection [to the Wuhan market] and there were people exposed to the market that were infected.” Baker says what is “very likely” is that the virus originated in a bat. “It a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.” “These wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,” she says. “It an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.” Turner adds: “We’ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.” Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About of people who get experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: A high temperature – you feel hot to touch on your chest or back. A new continuous cough – this means you have started coughing repeatedly. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a temperature or a cough? No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least days . If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least days , to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad. In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital. Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try to halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance. How many people have been affected? As of April, more than people have been infected in over countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering . There have been more than deaths globally . Over of those deaths have occurred in mainland China , where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. The US has had more than fatalities, Italy more than and Spain has seen more than The US has more confirmed cases than any other country – over Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than people are recorded as having recovered from coronavirus. Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts? We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in, but estimates of the mortality rate have ranged from well below in the young to over among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below and is thought to cause about deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. Have there been other coronaviruses? Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In Sars spread virtually unchecked to countries, causing global panic, infecting more than people and killing more than Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing of about people who have been infected.

25,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted,"Claim: ‘Face masks don’t work’ Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness). If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask. However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply. Claim: ‘It is mutating into a more deadly strain’ All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection – the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most “successful”. This doesn’t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted. Genetic analysis by Chinese scientists of samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version. The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more “aggressive”, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage – there haven’t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms. Claim: ‘It is no more dangerous than winter flu’ Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country response, said this has not been the case with The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly fatality rate are accurate. This would make about times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between and people a year globally. Claim: ‘It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax’ Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak. Claim: ‘You need to be with an infected person for minutes’ For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission. Claim: ‘A vaccine could be ready within a few months’ Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace , with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.’ Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

26,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/when-will-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready,"HOUGH we can slow the spread of through confinement and other social distancing measures, and scientists are developing drugs to treat its symptoms, the only way to actually prevent people from catching is with a vaccine – and we don’t yet have one of those. Nearly companies and academic institutions are racing to produce one, and of those, five are already testing their vaccine candidates in people. The first of these to enter human trials – one produced by Boston-based biotech company Moderna – did so on March. This unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of the virus that causes China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick. Coronavirus vaccine: when will we have one? But there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus – flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk – vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on “prototype” pathogens. “The speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,” says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate vaccine development. Here how your body gains immunity to coronavirus | Zania Stamataki Coronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. shares between and of its genetic material with the virus that caused SARS – hence its name. Both consist of a strip of RNA enclosed in a fatty shell through which protrude many protein spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung – the same type of receptor in both cases – allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process. All vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form. Like most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before months Professor Annelies Wilder-Smith Traditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy – the one that Novavax is taking, for example – constructs a “recombinant” vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast – forcing these micro-organisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, that are even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and a German company, CureVac, both of which are building vaccines out of messenger RNA. Cepi original portfolio of four funded vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, but it has since added four others that take more tried-and-tested approaches – including a project at the University of Oxford that uses a harmless, non-replicating virus to carry genetic material into the body cells – and it will continue to add to that portfolio. “Our experience with vaccine development is that you can’t anticipate where you’re going to stumble,” says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials. Clinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. “Not all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,” says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based non-profit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute . There are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they’re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can’t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material – RNA or DNA – has been approved to date, for example. So many of the vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: “While there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it really important not to take shortcuts.” An illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease. It for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November – an impossible deadline. “Like most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before months,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches. In the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it going to be needed in vast quantities – and many of the organisations in the vaccine race simply don’t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don’t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and last month it put out a call for bn to allow it to do so. Once a vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. “Getting a vaccine that proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what needed for a global immunisation programme,” says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics “Virus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.” The problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk – including children and pregnant women – with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines. Lockdowns can't end until vaccine found, study says Because pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India – a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world – not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own billion-strong population first, before exporting any. Outside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes – leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: “The question is, what will happen in a situation where you’ve got national emergencies going on?” This question is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. “[This pandemic] will probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available,” says Wilder-Smith. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating – like flu – and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to slow the spread of the disease as far as possible. So to repeat the sage advice: stay home, wash your hands.",1864
27,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/nhs-preparing-to-roll-out-covid-19-contract-tracing-app-by-end-of-may,"The NHS is making preparations to roll out its contact-tracing app nationwide before the end of the month, the Guardian understands. The smartphone app, which alerts people if they have come into contact with an individual who has reported coronavirus symptoms, is being trialled on the Isle of Wight and is a key part of the government “test, track and trace” strategy as the country eases out of lockdown. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, previously said the app, which has been beset by privacy issues , fears about its uptake among older people and concern that it may be dropped entirely , would be released nationwide in mid-May. The Guardian has been told, however, that the wider public in England will now have to wait until at least the week commencing May. The app was first made available to NHS workers as part of the Isle of Wight trial earlier this month, but the Department of Health and Social Care declined to clarify whether the same strategy would be used in the nationwide rollout. A spokesman said: “We intend to roll out the NHS app across the country for everyone to use in the coming weeks.” A Downing Street spokesman said: “We said the pilot would last for three weeks or so, and that remains the case.” Experts have cautioned that as many as million people in the UK risk being locked out of using the app because of a “digital divide”, putting potential constraints on their ability to work and safeguard their health. The Commons culture, media and sport committee heard that almost million households do not have internet access. A further million “have used the net, but have very basic skills, like not knowing how to open an app”. The government needs of the population to download the app for it to work effectively. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the Downing Street daily press conference on Thursday that people, or about half of the Isle of Wight population, had downloaded it so far during the trial. The island MP, Bob Seely, said however that the NHSX digital unit had told him there had been about unique downloads, and that some had come from elsewhere, including mainland UK. The Tory MP told the Guardian this was a strong result, given that only around people on the island were able to download the app if children and those with older phones or incompatible models were taken into account. “It is enough to make the test a significant success,” he said. “Because anything over [of the population downloading it] is useful, you’re getting exponential effect on the virus, but once you’re up in the that is really superb. “Clearly, what I would like is to drive that to three-quarters. because then it would make us safer, and it an even better model to learn from … But we’re probably in the maybe a bit higher.” The app uses Bluetooth technology to register when people come into close contact with each other. It relies on users to flag when they develop symptoms, then uses a central database to alert others with whom they have come into contact that they are at risk of infection so that they can self-isolate and get tested if necessary. The prime minister official spokesman said: “Well over half the population [on the Isle of Wight] have downloaded the app. We said the pilot would last for three weeks or so, and that remains the case. As issues have been coming up, we are ironing those out. The current intention is to go from the Isle of Wight to nationwide rollout.” Hancock has been receiving daily progress updates, he said. Asked whether it would be rolled out to Scotland, he replied: “It will be a matter for the Scottish government. It will be available, but public health is a devolved matter.” He also said the contact tracers Hancock had promised would be in place by the end of next week. A DHSC source, however, said no decision had been made on the exact timing of the rollout, that the Isle of Wight pilot was still being assessed, and that some areas of the county may be granted access before the whole population. A DHSC spokesman said: “We will be closely studying this first phase of the rollout, and expect to refine and improve the NHS app based on the feedback we receive from those taking part. Like any high-quality app, we will continually evolve and improve the app over the coming weeks.”",755
28,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/taiwan-must-accept-chinese-status-to-attend-who-assembly-says-beijing,"Beijing has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan call to be represented at next week assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China . The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan attendance – as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic – are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. Chinese diplomats have been contacting governments across Europe to limit the diplomatic support for Taiwan attendance, targeting northern and eastern European states. Maintaining collective EU unity on China is proving difficult. But in a letter to the Guardian , the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former president of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski and the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt argue that Taiwan should be permitted to attend because of its pioneering response to the pandemic, which has drawn on the lessons of the Sars outbreak. “It is regretful that geopolitics has prevented Taiwan from fully accessing the forums and services of the World Health Organization – not least as the WHO could have benefited from its expertise,” the authors argue. Let Taiwan help the WHO fight | Letter Taiwan had observer status at the WHO for seven years until when it was blocked by China, as it has been every year since. Beijing believes Taiwan is deploying the WHO issue as a route to recognition internationally. Donald Trump – locked into a multifaceted dispute with China – is already withholding US funds from the WHO, which he describes as “ China-centric .” He has led the calls for Taiwan to be admitted to the UN body, and support is also coming from Australia, the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany and New Zealand. China is also concerned it may be losing the support of India on the issue. Rasmussen argues next week assembly could prove a turning point in the fight against coronavirus, saying the pandemic has underlined the importance of robust multilateral coordination. In the letter, Rasmussen claims Taiwan success in controlling the virus shows the country has lessons to teach the rest of the world, adding its attendance “will have no wider implications than to ensure that million people with something to offer are not excluded from exchanging best practices”. Taiwan health minister, Chen Shih-chung, said on Friday his country could not accept China conditions for its participation. “We have no way to accept something that does not exist,” Chen replied, referring to China demand that Taipei agree to its “one China” policy to attend the assembly. WHO officials say the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cannot invite Taiwan since there are divergent views on the issue within. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has called for an independent inquiry into the crisis, writing: “To strengthen our defences against future pandemics, we also need a thorough, independent scientific inquiry into the origins of the crisis.” China has been resistant, and the terms of any inquiry, as well as its timing, will be contested. How Taiwan is containing coronavirus – despite diplomatic isolation by China Last month, Tedros himself accused Taiwan of racist “attacks” over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an allegation that Taiwan denied as “unprovoked and untrue”. Tedros claim came after Taiwan said in March that the organization had ignored its December warnings that human-to-human transmission of coronavirus was possible. A WHO tweet on January said: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” But documents show that the international body warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of as early as January. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has dismissed claims of Chinese dominance at the WHO as rumour and smear-mongering.",646
29,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/disaster-planners-condemn-government-controlling-approach-coronavirus-crisis,"Local emergency planning teams tasked with responding to say their effectiveness has been compromised by the top-down, uncommunicative and controlling approach to the crisis by central government, according to a leaked official document. The Whitehall review, revealed by the Municipal Journal and marked “official/sensitive”, found local disaster planners were deeply critical of the government, accusing it of withholding vital data and intelligence on the progress of the disease, failing to respond to requests for guidance, and neglecting to brief them on strategy and policy decisions. It reports that the local emergency teams, called Local Resilience Forums (LRFs), feel they have been largely kept in the dark by central government officials. “Due to paucity of information and intelligence, LRFs feel isolated from national decision-making and [are] unable to effectively plan and strategise [their] response,” it says. The review concludes: “We need to learn from our experiences so far and make immediate changes; lives are at stake.” The respondents criticised the “one size fits all’’ approach of the government, which they said failed to take account of local expertise. “Testing sites are a good example where one size does not fit all and local understanding/liaison with local LRFs of those differences may have provided a better service.” It criticises the government for a “uni-directional” and abrupt approach to communication that amounted to “broadcasting” rather than discussion. “The whole process so far has been peppered with surprise announcements at various tiers of government, resulting in partners being on the back foot.” It said: “Requests for tasks and information were coming out of central government and to LRF partnerships, but when questions or clarity requests were going back in to Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government or other departments, there was a long delay for answers, hindering the effectiveness of the response.” One response said: “[The centre] requests of us are short notice, extremely disruptive, but we get on and do; when we simply ask for guidance material or insight into government thinking, we get no response.” Share your experiences of expanded coronavirus testing in England The document is based on responses from over people from local government, NHS and fire and police services involved in LRFs – bodies set up in areas of England and Wales to prepare for and respond to major incidents and catastrophic events. The review, dated April, was carried out by Nottingham Trent University academics for the Foresight working group, a cross-departmental committee tasked with monitoring the response to The chair of the housing, communities and local government committee, Clive Betts, said: ‘The findings of this report are entirely disappointing. This crisis has probably accentuated a way of working by central government that always been there. “There is a recognition that local government has done tremendously well in responding to this crisis. If local government had been involved more closely, the response to this crisis would undoubtedly have been better.” An MHCLG spokesman said: “Councils, LRFs and other local partners are doing invaluable work in their communities across the country and supported by government. They are a highly trusted community who have regular contact with ministers and officials. “We share information from across government along with key data on a daily basis so that they can take decisions and make the appropriate plans locally to tackle the pandemic.” Adam Lent, director of the New Local Government Network, said: “This leaked report shows that the government obsession with controlling everything and cutting out local public services has damaged the response to the pandemic.”",584
30,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/ghosts-replace-crowds-as-covid-19-rattles-jordans-ancient-city-of-petra,"amels laze in the shade of old columns. Centre stage at the amphitheatre is temporarily reserved for goats. The noise of crowds in front of the treasury – the most recognisable and best preserved feature of the ancient city of Petra – has evaporated, and only birdsong intrudes on the silence. This is peak season of what was supposed to be a record year for tourism in Jordan crown jewel, the Nabataean metropolis carved into kaleidoscopic rock. But the last tourists left the Middle Eastern kingdom on March, just before it shut its borders because of coronavirus, and since then Petra and the surrounding towns have been deserted. “We just had our best year since the Arab spring, which affected us really badly,” says Jihad Kaldany, a guide who specialises in taking Christian tourists through the country Old Testament sites. Those visitors tended to be older people, the demographic most at risk of the virus. “If we knew it would be better in, say, two years, we could plan. But there is no assurance. Nobody knows.” The site in southern Jordan is one of the centres of an unprecedented crisis for the global tourism industry, with million livelihoods under threat and no end in sight. But the empty streets, hotel rooms and restaurants in Wadi Musa, the town that serves as gateway to Petra, also illustrate the dire challenge facing middle and lower-income countries over the next years. Most, like Jordan, have so far avoided the worst of the virus. They will not be spared the economic blow, with countries that were banking on tourism and hospitality to be major engines of their growth projected to suffer most, according to the International Monetary Fund . Surviving for long stretches without rainfall was the test of Petra original inhabitants. How to survive a year without tourists is the challenge facing its modern ones. “In a community like Wadi Musa, up to of people rely on tourism as their source of income,” says Suleiman Farajat, the chief commissioner of the Petra tourism authority. Across Jordan , tourism contributes about of the country GDP and sustains an estimated jobs. Petra welcomed more than million foreigners last year, a milestone that was fuelling a construction blitz in Wadi Musa. Suleiman Hasanaat was preparing to open a new hotel in late March. “As soon as they stopped the flights, all reservations were cancelled,” he says. The cost of the global lockdown is spreading through the town. “If you run a hotel, you buy vegetables and fruit from the markets,” Hasanaat says. “You employ people include maintenance and taxi drivers. The people with donkeys and horses. Those running small stores that depend on walk-in tourists. Even the people in the Turkish baths in the city. In every single family in Petra, there is somebody affected by this.” Just as for the hundreds of years before the site was “rediscovered” by a Swiss explorer in Bedouin people are the only sign of life inside the sandstone city. “We’re tired of doing nothing,” says Umar Ayyad, riding a donkey in the midday glare. He says he used to earn about dinars every day selling rides to tourists, enough to support his six children. He survived so far on small grants from the government, remittances from his brother in Europe, and by selling his sheep to settle debts. But he needs to pay down his balance at a local market by the end of the month to keep buying groceries, and money is already running short. “If the situation continues like this, it a problem,” he says. Governments in developed countries are scrambling to weave again the safety nets some have spent the past four decades unpicking. The welfare system in Jordan is relatively advanced compared with many of its neighbours, but still has huge gaps. Fewer than half of Jordanian workers are registered with the country social security system, which is already rationing its welfare payments. Without external aid, the fund could run dry within months. The rest of the country workforce, including tens of thousands of migrant workers, have no safety net at all, and are totally exposed to the vagaries and predations of the market. “This is the everything we’ve made in the past two months,” Muadth gestures at the handful of bills in the cash register, at a convenience store a few metres from Petra gates. The Yemeni, in sandals and a corduroy suit jacket, arrived in the tourist hub a year ago. Even in bad months, he says, he could send about dinars home to his family in Sana’a. “Now, nothing,” he says. “My younger brother sells water and the family lives off that.” His debts include to a pastry shop owner who sponsored his working visa a year ago. The pair had a falling out, and the man refuses to give back his passport unless Muadth can pay him for the cost of his working permit, he says. “I called him yesterday and said, listen, I’m not earning any money. He told me: deal with it. Sort something out.” The Jordanian government is trying to cushion the impact on the tourist industry by waiving some fees, postponing utility bills and offering loans to hotel owners and other stakeholders. Those measures might work in situations where tourist numbers have simply fallen, says Hasanaat, but when they are zero for months on end, more is needed. “We are indebted to our government for the lockdown,” he says. “They controlled [the virus]. We are in secure hands. But as soon as Jordan becomes a corona-free country, we will look around and see most industries are okay – but not tourism. Petra will die without direct support or loan packages.” To entice people back, tourism authorities are developing plans to market Petra as a safe destination in a post-Covid world. “We rely on outdoor tourism, which means that people are not stuck in closed areas,” Farajat says. “We will regulate the flow of tourists so that no large numbers are in close proximity.” He expects a few thousand foreigners to return this year, perhaps followed by a few hundred thousand next year. It will take several years, in the best case, to return to the heights of he says. A few days after Jordan closed its borders, Hasanaat went to Petra alone. “I just wanted to see it,” he said. “I just had this feeling – that I wanted to see it without tourists.” It was still dark as he strolled through the city, and he watched the sun come up in front of the treasury towering facade. “I stayed in front of it for two or three hours,” he said. “It was a very sad feeling, walking alone. I’m used to seeing it with crowds. Now it full of ghosts.” Coronavirus outbreak Middle East and North Africa Jordan holidays Middle East holidays news",1147
31,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/the-week-of-staying-alert-that-left-the-government-in-a-daze-coronavirus-boris-johnson,"early two months after lockdown began, coming out of it was always going to be a difficult message to sell. It might have been easier if the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, had been a little happier about Downing Street plan to announce an easing of the stay-at-home restrictions away from parliament on Sunday night. Boris Johnson had claimed it was because restrictions had to be altered for the Monday. But in truth the goal was to secure as large a TV audience as possible – although keeping the Speaker onboard meant vital explanatory documents had to be held back until the Commons was sitting on Monday. In the gap, fateful confusion was sown. Traditional media management required trailing the prime minister anticipated easing to the Sunday newspapers, and boldly Downing Street decided to brief its most reliable weekend paper, the Sunday Telegraph, with the revised slogan, “stay alert” . That morning, though, there was little to back it up. How on earth was it possible to stay alert against a virus? Was it really time to drop the clearly understandable “stay at home” message, even though there were still around people reported as dying every weekday? With little else to do, people rapidly shared their own versions online. “Be Vague, Cover Our Backs, Shirk Responsibility” said one of the many memes circulating. So the slogan – and the ensuing bafflement – became the story. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted out the Telegraph front page saying it was “the first I’ve seen of the PM new slogan” . Welsh and Northern Irish administrations, responsible for their own health policies, followed suit – and a day later Labour-run Wales briefly suggested it would be policing its own border with England . Bewilderingly suddenly, the integrity of the United Kingdom appeared in question. Johnson presidential address came at and an extraordinary audience of million people tuned in to see a tired-looking and unapologetic prime minister read from his prepared script . “No, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown,” Johnson said, while a series of coloured graphics swirled, suggesting that primary schools could reopen in early June and perhaps even bars and restaurants from the start of July. The prime minister may have only just survived his own brush with the disease, but the broadcast was not a moment for reflection. No apologies of the sort offered up last month by France president, Emmanuel Macron , who had admitted his government was “not prepared enough”. Nor the informal honesty of Germany chancellor, Angela Merkel, who gave a simple explanation of the significance of the R reproduction number . The British public scepticism rapidly turned to satire. Little more than an hour later, the comedian Matt Lucas spoke for a baffled nation , mimicking the voice of the prime minister. “So we are saying don’t go to work, go to work, don’t take public transport, go to work, don’t go to work.” Johnson statement was no longer a political announcement; it had become a cultural event. Conversations buzzed in chat groups: who was really being “actively encouraged” to go into work and what would the situation be on public transport? And – in a nation starved of social interaction – would it be possible to meet a line of friends, all metres distant from one another, or both parents in a park? Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, sought to explain the next morning . People could meet both parents outside as long as they stayed metres apart. Except the government had to rush out a clarification to say, no, people can only meet one parent a time from outside their household, a baffling restriction that made less sense as the week wore on and rules to allow estate agents into homes were relaxed . It fell to Phillip Schofield, the perennial This Morning presenter, to voice the growing national frustration . “You literally couldn’t write this. If this was in a farce on the telly I would go: ‘That is a bit far-fetched, no government would arse it up that much,’” he declared in a studio rant that left his co-presenter, Holly Willoughby, unable to get a word in. A day later Matt Hancock, the health secretary, went on to ITV to give the presenter some answers. But he ended up agreeing on-air that “summer is cancelled” and that people should not hug each other until a vaccine was found. It was as if the government could not catch up. The repeated missteps were a gift to Labour, whose new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, had been struggling to cut through, while the public had rallied around the government, the NHS and Johnson himself as he recovered from his serious brush with the deadly virus. Starmer was granted his own special broadcast on Monday . “After all this, all the sacrifice and the loss, we can’t go back to business as usual,” he said. And just as Downing Street finally thought it had managed to explain what the “stay alert” phase meant, Starmer successfully ambushed Johnson on Wednesday lunchtime at prime minister questions. Switching to the crisis in care homes, he challenged a clearly unprepared prime minister. Brandishing official advice that was valid until March, Starmer coolly accused the government of having “seeded” the epidemic in care homes by transferring in patients from hospitals. Johnson vainly tried to deny the advice existed. Then Downing Street claimed, wrongly, that Starmer was misquoting. The Daily Telegraph sketch writer Michael Deacon wrote that Johnson had been taken apart “like a Duplo train set” – and the sight of an effective, organised opposition attack left Tory MPs spooked. If there had been a truce over coronavirus, it was well and truly over – and pollsters recorded a shift in mood. This week YouGov reported that of Britons believed that the government messaging had been “not very clear” or “not clear at all”. They also saw Johnson net approval rating fall to plus – behind Starmer at plus It is too soon to say whether the government has bounced back from a week of disastrous communications, or whether the lifting of lockdown – and its necessary nuance – will continue to be dogged by frustration and confusion, but Schofield can be seen as a new barometer.",1050
32,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/coronavirus-who-will-be-winners-and-losers-in-new-world-order,"Andr à tutto bene , the Italians have taught us to think, but in truth, will everything be better the day after? It may seem premature, in the midst of what Emmanuel Macron has described as “a war against an invisible enemy”, to consider the political and economic consequences of a distant peace. Few attempt a definitive review of a play after the first three scenes. Yet world leaders, diplomats and geopolitical analysts know they are living through epoch-making times and have one eye on the daily combat, the other on what this crisis will bequeath the world. Competing ideologies, power blocs, leaders and systems of social cohesion are being stress-tested in the court of world opinion. Already everyone in the global village is starting to draw lessons. In France, Macron has predicted “this period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening. The day after when we have won, it will not be a return to the day before, we will be stronger morally. We will draw the consequences, all the consequences.” He has promised to start with major health investment. A Macronist group of MPs has already started a Jour d’Aprè s website. Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths? In Germany , the former Social Democratic party foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel has lamented that “we talked the state down for years”, and predicts the next generation will be less naive about globalisation. In Italy, the former prime minister Matteo Renzi has called for a commission into the future. In Hong Kong, graffiti reads: “There can be no return to normal because normal was the problem in the first place.” Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state under Richard Nixon, says rulers must prepare now to transition to a post-coronavirus world order. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said : “The relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysfunctional. is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.” The discussion in global thinktanks rages, not about cooperation, but whether the Chinese or the US will emerge as leaders of the post-coronavirus world. In the UK, the debate has been relatively insular. The outgoing Labour leadership briefly searched for vindication in the evident rehabilitation of the state and its workforce. The definition of public service has been extended to include the delivery driver and the humble corner shop owner. Indeed, to be “a nation of shopkeepers”, the great Napoleonic insult, no longer looks so bad. The obvious and widely drawn parallel has been, as so often in Britain, the second world war. In The Road to Paul Addison definitive account of how the second world war helped turn Britain to the left, he quotes the diary of the journalist JL Hodson in September “No excuses any more for unemployment and slums and underfeeding. We have shown in this war we British don’t muddle through. Using even half the vision and energy and invention and pulling together we’ve done in this war and what is there we cannot do? We’ve virtually exploded the argument of old fogies and Better Notters who said we cannot afford this and mustn’t do that. Our heavy taxation and rationing of food has willy nilly achieved some levelling up of the nation.” In the same vein, Boris Johnson has been forced to unleash the state, but the impact in Britain seems more noticeable on civil society than politics. The famously standoffish British are no longer bowling alone. The sense of communal effort, the volunteer health workers, the unBritish clapping on doorsteps , all add to the sense that lost social capital is being reformed. But there is not yet much discussion of a new politics. Perhaps the nation, exhausted by Brexit, cannot cope with more introspection and upheaval. In Europe , the US and Asia the discussion has broadened out. Public life may be at a standstill, but public debate has accelerated. Everything is up for debate – the trade-offs between a trashed economy and public health, the relative virtues of centralised or regionalised health systems, the exposed fragilities of globalisation, the future of the EU, populism, the inherent advantage of authoritarianism. It is as if the pandemic has turned into a competition for global leadership, and it will be the countries that most effectively respond to the crisis that will gain traction. Diplomats, operating out of emptied embassies, are busy defending their governments’ handling of the crisis, and often take deep offence to criticism. National pride, and health, are at stake. Each country looks at their neighbour to see how quickly they are “flattening the curve”. The Crisis Group thinktank, in assessing how the virus will permanently change international politics, suggests: “For now we can discern two competing narratives gaining currency – one in which the lesson is that countries ought to come together to better defeat and one in which the lesson is that countries need to stand apart in order to better protect themselves from it. “The crisis also represents a stark test of the competing claims of liberal and illiberal states to better manage extreme social distress. As the pandemic unfolds it will test not only the operational capacities of organisations like the WHO and the UN but also the basic assumptions about the values and political bargains that underpin them.” Many are already claiming that the east has won this war of competing narratives. The South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han, in an influential essay in El Pa ís , has argued the victors are the “Asian states like Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore that have an authoritarian mentality which comes from their cultural tradition [of] Confucianism. People are less rebellious and more obedient than in Europe. They trust the state more. Daily life is much more organised. Above all, to confront the virus Asians are strongly committed to digital surveillance. The epidemics in Asia are fought not only by virologists and epidemiologists, but also computer scientists and big data specialists.” He predicts: “China will now be able to sell its digital police state as a model of success against the pandemic. China will display the superiority of its system even more proudly.” He claims western voters, attracted to safety and community, might be willing to sacrifice those liberties. There is little liberty in being forced to spend spring shut in your own flat . Indeed, China is already on a victory lap of sorts, believing it has deftly repositioned itself from the culprit to the world saviour. A new generation of young assertive Chinese diplomats have taken to social media to assert their country superiority. Michel Duclos, the former French ambassador now at the Institut Montaigne, has accused China of “shamelessly trying to capitalise on the country ‘victory against the virus’ to promote its political system. The kind of undeclared cold war that had been brewing for some time shows its true face under the harsh light of The Harvard international relations theorist Stephen Walt thinks China may succeed. Offering a first take to Foreign Policy magazine , he suggests: “Coronavirus will accelerate the shift of power and influence from west to east. South Korea and Singapore have shown the best response and China has managed well in the aftermath of its initial mistakes. The governments’ response in Europe and the US has been very sceptical and likely to weaken the power of the western brand.” Many on the European left, such as the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek, also fear an authoritarian contagion, predicting in the west “a new barbarism with a human face – ruthless survivalist measures enforced with regret and even sympathy, but legitimised by expert opinions”. By contrast, Shivshankar Menon, a visiting professor at Ashoka University in India, says: “Experience so far shows that authoritarians or populists are no better at handling the pandemic. Indeed, the countries that responded early and successfully, such as Korea and Taiwan, have been democracies – not those run by populist or authoritarian leaders.” Francis Fukuyama concurs: “The major dividing line in effective crisis response will not place autocracies on one side and democracies on the other. The crucial determinant in performance will not be the type of regime, but the state capacity and, above all, trust in government.” He has praised Germany and South Korea . South Korea is in fact selling itself as the democratic power, in contrast to China, that has best handled the crisis. Its national press is full of articles on how Germany is following the South Korean model of mass testing . But South Korea, an export-oriented economy, also faces long-term difficulties if the pandemic forces the west, as Prof Joseph Stiglitz predicts, into a total reassessment of the global supply chain. He argues the pandemic has revealed the drawbacks of concentrating production of medical supplies. As a result, just-in-time imports will go down and production of domestically sourced goods will go up. South Korea may gain kudos, but lose markets. The loser at the moment, apart from those like Steve Bannon who argued for “the deconstruction of the administrative state”, risks being the EU. Some of Europe most scathing critics have been the pro-Europeans. Nicole Gnesotto, the vice-president of the Jacques Delors Institute thinktank, says: “The EU lack of preparations, its powerlessness, its timidity are staggering. Of course, health is not part of its competency, but it is not without means or responsibility.” The first instinct was to close borders, hoard equipment and assemble national responses. In times of scarcity it emerged every person was for themself, and Italy felt most left to itself. But the dispute has widened into an ugly battle between north and south Europe over the isssuance of common debt, or the conditions that could be set for any credit issued by the eurozone bailout fund. The Dutch and Germans suspect Italy is using the crisis in Lombardy to rebrand the rejected concept of eurobonds in which the north finances the debts of the feckless south. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is pushing the issue, telling the bloc “it has an appointment with history”. If the EU fails, it could fall apart, he has warned. The Portuguese prime minister, António Costa, spoke of “disgusting” and “petty” comments by the Dutch minister Wopke Hoekstra, while the Spanish foreign minister, Arancha González, wondered whether the Dutch understood that “a first-class cabin would not protect you when the whole ship sinks”. The former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta has been scathing about Dutch resistance to helping Italy, telling the Dutch press that the Italian view of the Netherlands has been seriously damaged: “It did not help that a day after German customs officials stopped a huge amount of masks at the border, Russian trucks carrying relief supplies drove through the streets of Rome and millions of masks were sent from China. Matteo Salvini is waiting for this type of action from the Netherlands and Germany so that he can say: you see, we have no use for the European Union.” The EU position is not irretrievable. Salvini closure agenda has not yet found its footing, since Conte popularity does not make the prime minister an easy target. Conte has become the single most popular leader in the history of the Italian republic. Individual German politicians, such as Marian Wendt, have also undone some of the damage by organising for a group of Italians to be flown from Bergamo to Cologne for treatment. But with the death toll mounting across Europe, and the crisis just starting to penetrate Africa, the EU discourse so far has been dominated by an unedifying and highly technical row about how to fund the EU economic rescue. Europe chief solace is to look across the Atlantic and watch the daily chaos that is Donald Trump evening press conference – the daily reminder that rational people can plan for anything, except an irrational president. Nathalie Tocci, an adviser to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, wonders whether, much like the Suez crisis symbolised the ultimate decay of the UK global power, coronavirus could mark the “Suez moment” for the US. Borrell himself insists the EU is finding its feet after a rocky start and the case for cooperation is being won. Writing in Project Syndicate , he claims: “After a first phase of diverging national decisions, we are now entering a phase of convergence in which the EU takes centre stage. The world initially met the crisis in an uncoordinated fashion, with too many countries ignoring the warning signs and going it alone. It is now clear that the only way out of it is together.” He may be proved right, but at the moment the scales are evenly balanced. There is, as yet, a world still to be won.",2150
33,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/schools-students-teacher-nhs-coronavirus-ppe,"rom university and school closures to A-level cancellations, young people have been deeply affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Despite this, staff and students across the UK are launching initiatives to support both their local community and the NHS . Harrogate grammar school, a comprehensive in North Yorkshire, has repurposed its design department as a PPE production line, and has made more than visors so far. Its headteacher, Neil Renton, said: “We’ve had parents who’ve been furloughed or lost jobs, who are ex-engineers, asking if they can help. We’ve not been able to support that as we’ve had so many staff members volunteer. I think it comes from an overwhelming desire from our teachers, who believe in public service, to make a difference.” The visors have been sent to local hospitals, paramedics and GP surgeries, as well as alumni working on the frontline. Jack Sheriff, who left the school in is a junior doctor on a coronavirus ward in the Midlands, and received a pack of six visors last week, stamped with the school emblem, the NHS logo, and the message “we stand together”. He said: “It really nice to have contact with people from your past who helped you get to where you are, and who are still supporting you and thinking of you. It a bit of a blast from the past to be under that logo again, and nice to be using the visors made by the laser cutter I used at school.” Schools are used to providing support for their more vulnerable students but since the crisis, extraordinary efforts are being made to help communities. At Meadowfield primary school in Leeds, almost half the students are entitled to free school meals. As well as providing hot meals for families to collect each day, the school has sent out food parcels containing enough supplies for two weeks, with the aim of sustaining vulnerable families over the Easter holidays. The headteacher, Helen Stout, said: “The butchers we use as a supplier have offered to give us bacon and sausages, and the local grocers have offered to do some delivery for us. People have been really kind and benevolent, and it nice to know we’re doing our bit. “It become a bit of a different role. It not just being head of a primary school, it managing community spirit.” Alongside staff-led directives to support pupils, students are embracing initiatives to celebrate and assist the key workers around them. At Thornhill College in Derry, many students expressed their fear and anxiety at the pandemic, many of whom had family and friends working on the frontline of the NHS. In response, the school asked for tributes to NHS staff to share on social media, and have been overwhelmed with the response. Along with the tributes, the school set up a fundraiser for their local hospital, with a target of – a figure that has been trebled in just two days. “It really has taken on a life of its own,” said Orla Donnelly, the vice-principal. “We’ve been swamped with people paying tribute to NHS workers, saying what they’re doing and why they’re so proud. Past pupils, teachers, mums, grannies and aunts are all doing it too. “Our corridors are silent and classrooms are empty, it doesn’t feel right. It only little, small things we’re doing but it contributing to that overwhelming feeling of gratitude for the frontline.” Medical students across the UK have been supporting NHS workers by babysitting for children, buying groceries, or driving them to work, as part of the National Health Supporters organisation, which receives between and requests for babysitting each day. Fourth-year medical student Saif Khan set up a branch in Manchester where he studies, which is now helping about families in the city. He said: “When my course got put on hold, we had free time, and I thought we could help NHS colleagues, many are our teachers and mentors. I put a post on Facebook to our medical school society and within three days I had received responses to be volunteers from not only medical students, but other healthcare students like nurses and speech therapists.” Other medical students have been joining the NHS prematurely , taking a combination of paid and voluntary roles in hospitals to support the strained service. “I’ve been at medical school for five years, and the last two years I’ve been in a purely clinical setting, so I’m familiar with hospitals,” said Phoebe Gray, a penultimate-year medical student who signed up to work at her local hospital in Bristol on the day her exams were cancelled. “It seemed silly just to sit around. It feels like we ought to be there when hospitals need us.” On her induction day, Gray was joined by scores of other trainees from across the medical profession, from mental health nurses to paramedics. She is now working as a nursing assistant in an intensive care unit, caring for a combination of cardiovascular and coronavirus patients – her first time working in a nursing role. “It good to feel like a cog in a moving machine,” Gray said. “You do hear horror stories, but when you hear people clapping outside on a Thursday evening, it does make you proud. Obviously it worth it.” Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",885
34,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/birth-of-a-pandemic-inside-the-first-weeks-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan,"The Huanan seafood wholesale market in central Wuhan was the kind of place where people often caught colds. Vendors started setting up as early as plunging their hands into buckets of cold water as they cleaned and prepared produce for the customers that arrived every morning. The sprawling market of more than streets spanned two sides of a main road in an upscale neighbourhood of the commercial district of Hankou. Racks of meat were hung on hooks or spilled out on plastic mats. Workers walked around in welly boots. Drains lined the kerb alongside stores selling everything from live poultry to seafood and cooking ingredients. It was crowded but clean. So, in mid-December when Lan, who sold dried seafood at one of more than stalls in Huanan, felt unwell, he thought little of it. He stayed home to rest but after losing in just a few days, he decided to go to his regular hospital for a check up. From there he was sent to a hospital that specialises in infectious diseases and was admitted on December. He remembers how the staff praised his positive attitude. “I was just a little bit sick. I wasn’t scared in the slightest,” said Lan, who asked not to disclose his full name. Lan could not have known then that he was among the first cases of a new, highly contagious coronavirus that would kill more than people in his city and engulf the world, infecting more than million people so far and killing more than The World Health Organization has described the outbreak of as the worst global crisis since the second world war. “I thought I had a cold. I had no idea,” he said. Coronavirus infections began cropping up in Wuhan in December – and reportedly as early as November – but the Chinese authorities did not inform the public that the virus could pass between humans until late January. Now, as China celebrates what it claims is victory over the disease, the number of infections and deaths is increasing around the world. Officials from Australia, the US and the UK have accused Beijing of suppressing information, allowing a localised outbreak to turn into a pandemic. Beijing claims its strict lockdowns bought the world time that health authorities in some countries chose to squander. But interviews with early patients, medical workers and residents, as well as leaked internal documents, accounts from whistleblowers and research studies, show delays in the first few weeks of the epidemic, government missteps that would have far-reaching consequences. Human-to-human transmission By the end of December, before Lan recovered after more than days in hospital, word had gotten out in Wuhan about a mystery illness. Internet users circulated screenshots of a WeChat conversation on December in which a doctor at Wuhan Red Cross hospital, Liu Wen, warned colleagues of confirmed cases of a contagious coronavirus at another hospital. “Wash your hands! Face masks! Gloves!” the medic wrote. That same day an ophthalmologist at Wuhan central hospital named Li Wenliang told a WeChat group of former medical school classmates that seven people at his hospital had contracted what he believed to be Sars, the outbreak that killed more than people in mainland China and Hong Kong in An “urgent notice” from the Wuhan health commission warning of “successive cases of unknown pneumonia” was also leaked and posted online on December. The statement ordered hospitals to “strengthen responsible leadership” and ensure that no one “disclose information to the public without authorisation.” Under growing pressure, the following day the health commission said researchers were investigating cases of viral pneumonia, its first official notice about the virus. There was no “obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission,” the statement said, describing the outbreak as linked to the seafood market and assuring the public that all patients had been quarantined and their contacts placed under observation. “The disease is preventable and controllable,” it added. A day later, on January, the Huanan seafood market was closed and Wuhan public security bureau announced that eight people had been “punished” for spreading rumours. Authorities also tasked hospitals to screen for pneumonia cases linked to the market. It wasn’t until January that vendors in the market were asked to submit to temperature checks and blood tests. But across the Yangtze River, some miles away, people who had never been to the market were falling sick. In the second week of January, Coco Han, developed a cough she couldn’t shake. After a week, she went to see her local clinic on January and had a CT scan done. The results showed an infection on her lungs. A medic in a full hazmat suit escorted her to another hospital for more tests. Han mother joined her in a crowded waiting room where those waiting began to panic. Han had a mask but her mother had not thought to wear one, given the government assurance. A young woman in line in front of them fainted and Han mother hugged her, telling Han not to look. “We all knew we might have the virus. Everyone was scared,” Han said. “I think the doctors knew it was transmissible between humans or they wouldn’t have sat so far from us and kept the windows open.” While Han was told that she probably had “that pneumonia”, she was not able to confirm the diagnosis because the hospital was not authorised to do so, an issue many early patients faced. She was told to go home and self-quarantine but the doctors prescribed her medicine that she had to renew every three days at the hospital, waiting in line with others. “I was extremely worried I was passing it to others, but I couldn’t let my parents go somewhere so dangerous,” she said. Daron Hu, who also had never been to the Huanan seafood market, began to feel feverish and dizzy on January. He thought he was just hungover after a few drinks the previous night. Three days later, still unwell, he took a train to Jiangsu province for a work trip. He travelled back to Wuhan and from there returned to his hometown a few hours to the south. By the time Hu was admitted into his local hospital, a team of researchers sent by the central government had arrived in Wuhan. Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert famous for countering the government narrative on Sars, said on the evening of January that there had already been cases of human-to-human transmission. Hu, who at his worst point suffered diarrhoea and breathing troubles in addition to a fever and a cough, told his family that he was fine. But over the next days in the hospital, at least three other patients died. He considered writing a will. “I saw some people give up. It is very lonely,” Hu said. ‘Things felt out of control’ By the time officials revealed the infectiousness of the virus, hospitals in Wuhan were already overwhelmed and the numbers increased after the announcement. Video taken on and January showed crowds of patients at Wuhan No hospital in Wuchang, another district of Wuhan. “It was so busy. We couldn’t go home,” said a nurse who slept in the hospital dormitory and rotated every four hours in a team of six people to keep up. Another medic gestured to the sidewalk outside the hospital. “This was all full,” he said. “Every day people were dying.” On January, the city of million people was placed under lockdown. Surrounding areas followed suit, putting a total of more than million people under de-facto home quarantine. Facing severe shortages of supplies, staff and space, the next few weeks were desperate. Hospitals turned away patients, sending them home where they often infected their families. Footage showed medics weeping and people collapsed in the streets. Dead bodies were left in hospitals where staff were too busy to collect them. Internet forums filled with pages of pleas for help by residents trying to save loved ones. By February, the death toll from the virus had passed “The virus was very quick. At the beginning, things felt out of control. We didn’t know what would happen,” said one doctor treating coronavirus patients at Wuhan central hospital, who asked not to be named because he was not given permission to speak to media. It is a time authorities are quick to gloss over as they celebrate the lifting of Wuhan almost three-month lockdown, an event marked with light shows and banners hailing the success of the “people war”. “Beijing has been working very hard to fight the negative domestic and international fallout,” said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. “But this is far from adequate in stopping people from discussing China responsibility in covering up the outbreak in the beginning,” he said. Wuhan is slowly coming back to life. Neighbourhoods have erected flags and signs declaring them “virus free”. Cars are starting to fill the streets again as people return to work. Yet, visible reminders of the epidemic remain. Rows of tall metal fencing surround the still-shuttered Huanan seafood market, its former entrances manned by security while police cars patrol nearby. And not everyone is willing to forget. On a wall near her home, Han recently spray-painted the Chinese characters bu neng, bu mingbai (I cannot, I do not understand), a reference to a declaration Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor, was forced to sign before eventually succumbing to the virus he tried to warn others about. Underneath the words, some residents have burned piles of paper money, a way to honour the dead, drawing small white circles around the ashes. “They said stay. I stayed. They said everything was fine. I believed. I believed it all,” Han says. “I want to know why this happened. Who said not to tell people?” “I will remember this for the rest of my life – I understand now that we are not important.” Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang",1658
35,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/tech-giants-struggle-stem-infodemic-false-coronavirus-claims,"Click over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter. The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search. There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate. Algorithms and user-generated content are out; gatekeepers and fact checking are in. Silicon Valley has responded to the “ infodemic ” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets. Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to are similarly predetermined. Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus. On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO. It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past. US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political. They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech , anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings . On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media. Research by Oxford Reuters Institute looking at the spread of false or misleading claims about coronavirus found of the claims had appeared on social media platforms, compared with on television or in news outlets. Nearly of US adults believe was developed in a lab, according to a survey by Pew Research Center . A conspiracy theory falsely linking to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences , including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles. Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late. “They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.” We’ve seen the US government becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus Carl Bergstrom Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp strict new limits on message forwarding. The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft. “There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.” It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased. Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths? Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon , and people who believe is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities. “The sad thing is to see those kinds of conspiracies moving to neighbourhood groups, and family groups,” said Wardle. “It like sparks are flying off the bigger [conspiracy] groups and moving into other groups. Everyone is so frightened right now that it a tinderbox and these sparks are coming off and catching fire.” And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily. Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information. “We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said. Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro , but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump. “We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”",932
36,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/where-is-the-cdc-trump-covid-19-pandemic,"obert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the world premier public health agency, was stooped over the White House lectern. He conceded that the coronavirus pandemic had “overwhelmed” the US, and that there would be a “difficult” second wave of the virus later in the year. His boss had different thoughts, however. Redfield, a career virologist, made way for Donald Trump , the US president and former host of The Apprentice, who intoned to the cameras that Redfield had been “totally misquoted” in a previous Washington Post story warning of a damaging resurgence of Invited to clarify, Redfield confirmed he was quoted correctly. Trump again took to the lectern to try a different tack. “You may not even have corona coming back,” the president said, contradicting Redfield again. “Just so you understand.” The CDC director, looking on impassively, would not appear at a White House coronavirus press conference again. The exchange , on April, was seen by some CDC staff as grim confirmation that the agency venerated expertise has been shoved to one side as continues to ravage the US, causing more than deaths so far . For the first time since when the CDC flickered to life in a cramped Atlanta office with a brief to fight malaria, the agency is not at the frontline of a public health emergency in the US. The low profile of the CDC has caused “frustration and some embarrassment”, according to Jeffrey Koplan, the director of the CDC under Bill Clinton and George W Bush. “It like you’re an accomplished violinist playing in a quartet and you’re told you can’t use your right arm. That the feeling.” When facing previous threats to public health, from the flu pandemic to salmonella outbreaks to the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), the CDC was a hive of activity publicly and behind the scenes, holding daily briefings, working on vaccines, and crafting guidance solemnly followed by governments domestic and foreign. But during the greatest health emergency in a century, the CDC has been almost entirely erased by the Trump administration as the public face of pandemic response. An approach of collaboration and open dialogue has been replaced by reticence and a fear of retribution from the Trump administration , according to some CDC staff. The diminished role of the CDC is obvious to its former leaders. “There no question the CDC has been sidelined,” said Tom Frieden, CDC director during Barack Obama presidency. “The US has not been making use of CDC expertise, and as a result the response has not been good as it could have been. I can only imagine how distressing it is to not contribute during to the biggest public health crisis in our lifetimes.” Frieden said there is “puzzlement” among the American people over the CDC absence from the public stage, leading to confusion over the scope of the pandemic and the best measures to tackle it. The early days of the virus outbreak did see several CDC officials issue stark warnings, only to disappear from public view. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, accurately forecast on February that the virus was not contained and would grow into a pandemic. This comment, which diverged from the confident assurances given by other administration officials, caused the stock market to plunge and prompted a reportedly enraged Trump to threaten to fire her. Messonnier, one of the country most respected virus experts, was then removed from future White House press conferences and, after subsequently warning that the virus could extend into next year, has not featured since in public briefings held by the CDC. “When we were hearing from Nancy regularly, we had a real sense of what was happening with the pandemic. But it clearly wasn’t popular with the administration,” said Frieden. The White House coronavirus taskforce has taken on much of the CDC mantle. Redfield, currently self-quarantining after coming into contact with an administration adviser with is a member of the taskforce, but has been largely eclipsed by Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who is also isolating himself for the same reason. The presence of these experts has not prevented Trump making a string of inaccurate and potentially dangerous statements, such as claiming the virus would fade away by April, that a vaccine will be shortly available and that people may want to inject themselves with disinfectant to treat the virus. “These weird therapies and concepts have undermined confidence,” said Koplan. “During a pandemic you’re not looking for weird, particularly from someone in ultimate authority.” CDC advisories have either been fatally undermined or buried by the Trump administration or the president own pronouncements. After the CDC recommended the wearing of face coverings in public, Trump used the same announcement to confirm he would not, in fact, be wearing a mask. “Somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know, I don’t see it for myself,” the president said. Frieden said the garbled message conveyed to the public was “very unfortunate”. Other advice sent from the CDC Atlanta base to the White House has been rejected, such as a suggestion in March that sick and elderly Americans be advised not to fly on commercial airlines because of A CDC stipulation that cruise ships remain docked until August was amended by the White House to allow the ships to set sail a month earlier. As Trump shifted from fraught attempts to contain the coronavirus to advocate for a reopening of American businesses, the CDC drew up a step-by-step guide, approved by Redfield, for state and local authorities on how to safely allow people to frequent restaurants, bars and other public spaces again. However, the White House told scientists the guidance would “never see the light of day”, according to reporting by AP . Trump advisers, including the president chief of staff, Mark Meadows, reportedly felt the document was too prescriptive. The CDC put forward much stricter advice on reopenings than the White House, according to AP , such as placing a much longer timeframe before non-essential travel was recommended to resume. The decision has left the US with no detailed federal plan on how to emerge from the pandemic lockdown, echoing the administration lack of a plan to roll out widespread testing and contact tracing to try to curb the spread of the virus. At one point, Trump claimed to have ultimate authority over such matters but has since left it to individual states on how to proceed. “There continues to be absent a cohesive, thoughtful plan that everyone can buy into and follow,” said Koplan. “Leaving it to the states alone is somewhat misguided. There is no federal game plan, and there is a price to pay for that.” The CDC has also erred during the pandemic, most significantly in the initial effort to develop its own test for The testing kits proved to be faulty, with the problem compounded by sluggish efforts to rectify the deficiencies and then by severe bottlenecks in distributing enough tests to the public. The US is still falling well short of the number of tests experts say is needed every day to allow a safe resumption of normal life. No leadership and no plan: is Trump about to fail the US on coronavirus testing? But public health specialists are still mystified by the CDC low profile as the pandemic has swept across the country. “The CDC has the best public health officials there are – they are very intelligent and tremendous public servants. But they have been sidelined,” said Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health. “We need their scientific leadership right now.” Koplan said the last few months has left the CDC “badly bruised” but added it was encouraging that polling shows Americans still mostly have positive feelings about the agency. “The CDC has been shaken but this experience will show that we need to reaffirm its role,” he said. A spokesman for the CDC said there was no ban or restriction on agency experts speaking publicly. “The mainstays of CDC – epidemiology, laboratory science and surveillance – are helping shape our nation response, as well as the response by our state and local health department partners who continue to be on the frontline fighting this war,” he said. “CDC is engaged operationalizing the response throughout this nation.”",1428

With the continent facing its biggest challenge since do the lessons of the war and its aftermath have any resonance for young people? Millennials from around Europe share some of their thoughts and fears. We are forgetting the lessons of “At times of crisis, populism, racism, xenophobia and fascism rise. After the coronavirus economic crisis really hits, we will witness an unbearable climate of pro-nationalist sentiment. In a world of global challenges nations are the wrong scale to solve those problems.” Isabel, scientist, Spain We thought war had gone the way of the guillotine “The fraying of the European project recently has made the second world war suddenly more relevant. For a long time we thought the continent bloody divisions were consigned to the past along with slavery or the guillotine. Now it feels like Europe tormented history was merely suspended for a few decades. I’m not frightened of a return to armed conflict, but the potential of destructive disunity feels very real. I have no sentimentality for VE Day but I do think that it should be commemorated.” Aleks, Serbian, living in the UK As a German , people backing the far right feels very scary “Of course there are lessons for my generation from the second world war. I grew up in Germany after all, and what thoughts of racial elitism can do was shockingly impressed on me. How people are turning back to far-right groups all over Europe is very scary.” Sophia, Brandenburg, Germany It was hell, not our finest hour “I am sick of hearing about the war. The allies committed atrocities, war brings out the worst in all people. My friend grandad took part in the D-day landings. He said they hit the legs of the soldiers to get them out on the beaches, they were not brave or heroic willingly and they all shit themselves literally. It was hell, not our finest hour. The lesson to learn is no one should think they are better than anyone else and that peace is the most valuable thing we can possibly have.” Jennifer, London I live in fear of another war “I feel like it our moral responsibility to not let history repeat itself. I’m very fearful of the nationalism, populism, isolationism and the rise of hard-right parties in Europe (and in the world of course) that we face currently. I live in constant fear that this degradation will eventually evolve and lead to From the pandemic I see a lot of great humanity, empathy, solidarity. But I also see terrible things: self-centredness, selfishness, disinformation, intolerance, etc. And I see countries that are absolutely not ready for what coming.” Nina, legal assistant, Montpellier, France Division hides behind nationalism “Austria in particular has a tragic past when it comes to nationalism, and people here are acutely aware of this. On the other hand, history never exactly repeats itself and I doubt the horrors of the past would really take place in the same way. Nevertheless, what hides behind nationalism is a profound division between groups of people, which is the antithesis of the European project.” Louis, Vienna You can feel the nationalism in Denmark “I think it good we talk about the second world war in the UK. My boyfriend is Danish and says that despite the country being occupied, and he has family who were young adults at that time, it isn’t talked about. He never had a conversation with them about it, or how it impacts their views today. Nationalism worries me very much. You see it across Europe, in ways more subtle than Brexit. Freedom of movement seems to be viewed very negatively by many people. When visiting my boyfriend family in Denmark multiple acquaintances or random people have expressed negative feelings about the fact he dating a foreigner.” Heather, Edinburgh My grandmother garden was bombed during “This was a traumatic experience and has taught me, as a millennial, not to take peace for granted. Our national curriculum is flawed, however. At school we are taught predominantly about Britain role in the war, as if it defeated the Nazi regime singlehandedly. In reality, Britain success depended entirely on our continental and global alliances.” Sonia British, living in Paris The pandemic has boosted rightwing populists “The second world war still divides my nation today. Politicians have been using it divide the nation. It like a continuous witch-hunt ever since the breakup of Yugoslavia that shifts the focus away from the real lessons of the war. The pandemic too has made me pessimistic. It has enabled a rise in rightwing governments in many parts of Europe which used the lockdown to start implementing their draconian laws.” Andreja, Ljubljana, Slovenia In Italy, few have heard of VE Day “VE Day symbolises an important victory indeed. People were happy not to be under German oppression anymore, but in Italy most people do not feel it or don’t even know it exists. We mark our own liberation day on April. I can see first hand in Italy what nationalistic propaganda is like and what nationalism-oriented communication is like. It scary.” Lorenzo, Milan Commemorating matters “I think it important to acknowledge those who gave up so much for our freedom. My dad lives in South Yorkshire and they have been celebrating VE Day in their socially distanced front gardens! My generation should still learn the lessons of the war. But as our government refused PPE from the EU procurement agreement, it makes me pessimistic about the idea of Britain working with Europe.” Rosie, primary teacher, South Yorks, based London Time to move on from a nationalist icon “I think we need to get away from the second world war as a cultural touchstone. Not forget that it happened but with every passing day the context we live in is further removed from it. It has become warped into a nationalist icon, removed from the reality of what actually happened. The ‘lessons’ people use it to teach are that Britain is special in Europe because we weren’t invaded, fuelling the delusion that we can do everything alone. The tub-thumping pseudo-patriotism of wannabe demagogues is terrifying.” Nick, PhD student, Manchester Croatia remains blighted by that era “For a Croat in particular, the second world war continues to mark my generation as we haven’t been able to transcend divisions dating from then. Some in my generation still struggle to make sense of the lessons of the war. For me it is clear: after the worst modern atrocities on the continent, we as Europeans committed to creating a more peaceful continent. One thing that the Covid crisis might bring is to reveal the inability of nationalist governments to manage the pandemic on their own.” Luka, Zagreb Solid wartime values are evident in the pandemic “Captain Tom and my grandfather exemplify VE Day to me. That stiff upper lip determination that were are not alone and all in this together. Or the Queen saying we will meet again. This crisis shows that the level of support forged in the cauldron of the second world war are still with us. Whether the staff of the NHS or carers, volunteers racing around to deliver food parcels.” Ben, engineer working as a bin collector, Carlisle Britain is obsessed by the war in a way no other country is “I am anxious about VE Day. My fear is that the loudest voices will be those who want to shout about Britain standing alone and using that to justify a nationalist agenda despite the passage of years. Britain seems obsessed with the war in a way no other European country is.” Peter, London I feel blessed that my best friends are now German “I am the grandchild of a Holocaust survivor, and my Dutch grandparents both suffered under German occupation. Being Jewish and living in Amsterdam, the scars of the Jewish community are all over the city. I can’t speak for my generation, but I can say that for me it feels like peace is conditional, it is hard-fought. The fact that many of my best friends are now Germans is a blessing I never take for granted.” Software engineer, Amsterdam The UK cherrypicks history “The second world war teaches us ‘never again’. The trouble is, most people take that to mean just the gas chambers; everything leading up to that point is apparently acceptable. I also think the UK looks on WWII as a glorious victory of the British against the Germans, rather than a collaborative effort against fascism. The UK has cherrypicked and romanticised history, which makes it impossible for us to learn from it.” Sarah, Milton Keynes Two lessons matter “I would say the second world war taught us that no country can make it alone and left us with a deep mistrust of nationalism. However, I look around and I see how little of these two lessons has actually stuck.” Michaela, scientist, Italy Young people are ignorant about the parallels “Too many people my age do not even know about the Holocaust, and just how easily European countries slid into horrific persecution and violence. I think our generation needs to contend with this now more so than ever, with razor-wire fences going up all over European and racism, Islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination and gender-based discrimination all on the rise in recent years. A better understanding of this history will remind our generation how easy it is for a society to fall into the abyss.” Adam, Helsinki The memory of the war has been corrupted “The narrative often portrayed in our history lessons was of national pride and British exceptionalism. Having been fortunate to speak to a number of elderly relatives who played a part in the war their stories didn’t match what we were taught, rather they focused on the horrors experienced, and the need for co-operation. I think our generation needs to be aware that the memory of the war has been corrupted to encourage nationalism and British exceptionalism.” Oliver, student, Norfolk This article was amended on May to remove some personal information.",1705
40,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/belgium-experiments-with-corona-bubbles-to-ease-social-restrictions,"It been called the four-person puzzle. If you could only have the same four family members or friends to dinner for a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown, who would you choose? That is the dilemma the Belgian government has handed its citizens as it moves to the next phase in easing restrictions on everyday life. From Sunday, every household in Belgium can invite up to four guests to their home. Two sets of four people make a “corona bubble”, who can visit each other homes. No one else is allowed into the domestic social circle. The concept, also being discussed by the British government , opens up the biggest social minefield of the coronavirus lockdown. Belgium prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, announced the plan last week, after being accused of prioritising the economy over people wishes to be reunited with friends and family. Allowing social bubbles to start on Sunday, Mother Day in Belgium and much of continental Europe, is no accident. “The physical separation from those whom we love has in some cases become unbearable,” Wilmès said, but visitors are told not to hug or exchange the typical three-kiss greeting. The government expects guests to stay metres apart and suggests people meet in gardens or on terraces where possible. Authorities say it impossible to police the policy, so they are relying on people sense of civic duty. Belgians, especially large families or those where one or both parents have remarried, are already contemplating their choices. “It terribly complicated. I understand the spirit, but the letter [of the law] is completely impossible,” said Anne, a old finance director, who preferred not to give her surname. She lives in Brussels with her husband and two teenage daughters. “Do we elect a full family of four of whom they are our sole contact and we are their sole contact? That means I can’t allow any of my kids’ friends to visit them.” Her priority is to see her teenage son, who lives with his father and has asthma, meaning he has been isolated from the rest of the family. But she doesn’t want to cut her two daughters off from their friends. “I don’t intend to keep a flipchart of who is seeing who,” she said. “I think it is more important to get into the spirit of it than the letter.” There has been a lot of confusion about the letter of the policy. “The problem is that the way the idea was communicated was not very clear from the start,” said Karen Phalet, a professor in psychology at KU Leuven university. Many people did not realise that all four guests were meant to come from the same household. Epidemiologists advising the government chose the number four because it matches current capacity to do contact tracing if someone falls ill. Pairing two households also reduces the risk-multiplier effect that would come from allowing more varied mixing, but epidemiological models do not square with how people socialise in real life. “If one family can have contacts with one family for Mother Day, we have to make a choice, either the mother or the mother-in-law,” Phalet said. “It a hard choice for some families. Is it children friends? Is it parents or is it grandparents who have the priority?” She says the idea to connect just two households is not the way people normally socialise, and that raises questions about whether the policy can work: “If the distance between what people normally do and the restriction is too large I think it a bit risky.” Belgium “corona bubble” is similar to the German approach, where people from two separate households are allowed to meet from this weekend under the new relaxation of the country lockdown. Only one person per household was previously able to meet a person from another household. In theory, two families or two couples may now meet, providing they observe the physical distancing rule and face coverings are worn if they meet outside. It has not been specified whether a family can meet up with one family on one day and another family the next. The assumption is that that is the case but it is yet to be clarified. These new rules will be in place until June, by which time they will have been reviewed. In Spain, which has been under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe , the government has said that groups of up to people will be able to gather in private homes or outdoors from Monday, but only in areas of the country that have been given permission to move to the second phase of the lockdown de-escalation plan. About of people in Spain, including those in the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, will move to the next phase on Monday. The Madrid and Barcelona regions, two of the hardest-hit areas, will remain in the preliminary phase for the time being. Back in Belgium, households have been making up their minds. Phalet, who specialises in child psychology, says she will prioritise her children social life over her own. She thinks school closures are really hard for children everywhere. “We know [social networks] are very important, not just for their wellbeing, but in terms of normative contexts. If they meet other peers they can also learn from each other” On Mother Day, Phalet and her siblings will meet their old mother via Zoom. For now, the Belgian government main message is that people should stay at home as much as possible. “I am hoping that when contract tracing is in place we can get some social life back pretty soon in a way that is responsible,” Phalet said. “But we are not there yet.” Additional reporting by Kate Connolly in Berlin and Sam Jones in Madrid The graphic in this article was amended on May to correct the information about the Netherlands, where cinemas, cafes and restaurants remain closed for now; and to clarify that all shops selling essential items in Belgium are open.",1000
41,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/there-is-a-glimmer-of-hope-economists-on-coronavirus-and-capitalism,"David McWilliams: I think it is fair to say that capitalism – in the course of this unprecedented crisis – has been suspended. We are not going back to where we were, to business as usual. The state has come back, and this episode will not be forgotten by the electorate. I don’t know where we are going, but one thing seems clear: we are not going back. Yanis Varoufakis : I like this phrase: capitalism has been suspended. The last time capitalism was suspended in the west was during the second world war, with the advent of the war economy: a command economy that fixed prices. The war economy marked the transcendence of the standard capitalist model. But what we see now is not so much the suspension of capitalism. The rules of capitalism may have been suspended – all those sacrosanct policies are gone, the neat separation of fiscal and monetary policy is gone, the idea that public debt is a bad thing is gone. But the institutions that are necessary to build “the war economy without war” so to speak – to suspend and transcend capitalism – those have not been put in place. There is a profound difference between saying: “It all going to shit, so we don’t expect you to stick to the rules,” and saying: “The rules themselves have changed, and we must make new ones to prevent an economic collapse.” All this talk of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank suggests that we remain very far from a war economy mindset. DM: This is a familiar category error in Europe . If you are basing your economic policy on the willingness of people who are too traumatised and sick to borrow – which is the core logic of quantitative easing – then you have a very serious problem. A common image of quantitative easing is the hose: a huge monetary hose, with water gushing out to stop the fire of crisis. But the hose of monetary policy is limited by this little valve called the banks, a little valve called the credit committee, a little valve called the “willingness of business to borrow money”. And ultimately, that hose of money becomes a trickle – and even that trickle stands to benefit the wealthy much more than the poor. So I take your point that despite the suspension of the rules, the infrastructure remains in place. But people across Europe are now saying: “Hey, there is an alternative.” This second phase will be about how we move ahead in rethinking capitalism, in rethinking finance, rethinking how economies work and for whom – potentially toward a new Bretton Woods-style settlement for the entire global economy. So that where we are: in the first year of the third decade of the century. Looking out at the next decade, armed with history as well as economics, what do you think the global and European economy will look like? YV: We are sitting on a saddle point, prepared to tip in either direction. It is utterly indeterminate which of the two directions we travel. Let us start with the positive scenario. It builds from your point about the prospects for a new Bretton Woods – with its particular manifestation in the European Union. The fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope If we are going to have continental consolidation, what should it look like? It would not be a federation, because – even though that is more necessary than ever – it is less likely than ever, because the centrifugal forces of the coronavirus crisis, the migration crisis, and the euro crisis are pulling us apart. But the alternative is to deploy the existing [EU] institutions in a way that can simulate a federated Europe, and we can do this tomorrow, if we so choose: to provide immediate cash to all those who are struggling in poverty, to invest in the green transition . There is a glimmer of hope here, because there is a profound difference between and Back then, when Ireland and Greece went belly up, there were remarkable dissimilarities between what our countries were experiencing and what Germany was experiencing, what Holland was experiencing. Today, Germany industrial machine is broken – and was broken long before coronavirus hit. Two main industries – automobiles and machine tooling – were already in serious trouble. So the fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope that they might say: what should we do? It no longer: “Your problem: here the Troika .” DM: And we will send you the bill as well! So that the positive scenario. The interruption of “business as usual” gives way to new policies and new possibilities for Europe and beyond. What the other option? YV: Well, we humans – and we Europeans, in particular – love to miss fantastic opportunities and end up with dystopian outcomes instead. It very likely that we will encounter the same recalcitrance by the same set of European ordoliberals , who will keep putting roadblocks in the way of moves toward a genuine, democratic federalism. DM: Obviously, such a roadblock will have a disproportionate impact on the southern member states of the European Union. What do you think the impact of this particular trauma will have on, say, Italy – a founding member of the European Union, and a crucial part of Europe emotional hinterland? YV: Every time there is a crisis in Europe, Italian growth rates fall. Every time there is a problem, Italy sinks deeper into stagnation – with Salvini waiting in the wings. If Frankfurt, Berlin, and Brussels fail again to move toward the positive scenario, Italy – not just Italy, but all of Europe most devastated regions – will move again toward the neo-fascist right. In that case, all bets are off. This is the endpoint of the negative scenario: a giant domino effect, leading to the disintegration of the European Union. Not that the EU will cease to exist. Only that it will become irrelevant, like the Commonwealth of Independent States . DM: Oh, I remember the Commonwealth of Independent States very well … YV: It still exists! It still has an office in Moscow. So the negative scenario is that the European Union will become like the CIS. And that will be music to the ears of the Trumps, Bolsonaros, and Modis of this world. We would move into a transactional, Hobbesian global economy: nasty, brutish, and poor for the majority of people. My sense is that the period when you could travel, engage, move, we might have reached the end of that open period. DM: When I was born in Ireland, the country was very poor. And then it became quite wealthy, on the back of the European project, on the back of Europe position in the global supply chain, and with a tax policy that attracted lots and lots of capital. My sense is this model might be gone, and this style of globalisation along with it. I fear that the period when you could travel, engage, move – we might have reached the end of that open period. People will say: “This virus came from the cosmopolitan world, from the world of international movement.” Whether it right or not, we might begin to blame people. We know that the Black Death resulted in ferocious antisemitism in Europe. People asked: “Who can we blame for this?” And so they blamed the one community that was already in isolation in the ghetto. This is what terrifies me most, sitting here in the first year of the third decade of the century. What we saw before may come again, and we turn back to Yeats: “Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.” I fear now, unless we move quickly and in a new direction, the world that my kids will inherit is going to turn very nasty, indeed. So it a clarion call. YV: The loudest call in a generation. I share all of your concern for the future, although I must challenge the analysis on which it is based. The openness that you describe has always gone hand in hand with severe restriction : Nafta and the US-Mexico border; freedom of movement in Europe and Frontex along the Mediterranean. This is not a contradiction; it is the logic of a system that prizes the movement of capital over the freedom of human beings. If we fail now to stand together – to rally around a new Bretton Woods, to deliver the investments that humanity and the planet so desperately need – my fear is that this system will only deepen its cruel logic. Surfing on the hose of liquidity unleashed by the policies like quantitative easing, the financial sector will increase its grip on the global economy; bankers are very good at getting rich from such volatility. So now is the time for us, here in Europe as around the world, to mobilise behind this shared vision of a global new deal. Because without it, the walls between us will only get taller and thicker: porous only to the money that flows through them. This is an edited version of a conversation that will appear in A Vision for Europe Nothing But an Alternative , published this month by Eris.",1600
42,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/fifty-shades-sligo-normal-people-bbc-poses-challenge-irish-tourism,"romoting Ireland as a tourism destination used to be straightforward – just showcase the bucolic landscape and put a slogan on the end – but that was before Normal People turned a chunk of the Atlantic coast into Fifty Shades of Sligo. The television adaptation of Sally Rooney novel features beautiful shots of Sligo beaches and mountains, plus Trinity College Dublin, but there is also sex. Lots of sex. Some vocal critics call it porn. Others say the explicit scenes are sensitively handled but still make them squirm. For the marketing people at Tourism Ireland this has created a delicate challenge: tap the international acclaim for the series and book, but keep the carnality bottled up. The agency has created a behind-the-scenes film about the TV series but was “selective” in its use of clips, Brendan Griffin, the tourism minister, told Dáil Éireann, the lower house of parliament, this week. “Tourism Ireland has been very active online in promoting Ireland and imagery from Ireland. Very recently, that imagery included Sligo and some of the cinematography in Normal People, which was partly filmed there,” he said. “They had to be selective with the cinematography as not everything is suitable for worldwide distribution from a tourism perspective.” The aim was to entice visitors after coronavirus restrictions ease, said Griffin. “Sligo always looks fantastic on screen.” Frankie Feighan, a TD (MP) for the Sligo–Leitrim constituency, responded with his own plug for the region. “With regard to Normal People, my father comes from Tubbercurry where much of it was filmed, and I like to think we are all normal people down there.” The tone was wry. Ireland is a different country to the one where clerics and politicians fulminated against fornication and said there was no sex until television – a reference to a Late Late Show episode in which a quiz contestant revealed she didn’t wear a nightie on her wedding night. The ensuing furore became known as the “bishop and the nightie” incident . Half a century later, Ireland has greeted the novel and TV adaptation of Normal People – which is showing on RTÉ, BBC and the streaming service Hulu – with similar rapture to that shown in the UK and US. There is pride in Rooney, the author, and Lenny Abrahamson, the director, for turning the story of the relationship between sixth-form and then university students Marianne and Connell into a cultural touchstone. Tourism Ireland teamed up with the production company Element Pictures to make the short behind-the-scenes film. It includes clips of Ben Bulben, Sligo flat-topped rock formation, Trinity front square, chaste encounters between the two main characters, and commentary. Daisy Edgar-Jones , who plays Marianne, says: “One of my favourite places to film would probably have been Sligo. It was just the most jaw-dropping entrance to any place I’ve ever experienced. When you see Ben Bulben in the distance, it just immense.” Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said the film showcased Ireland beauty and homegrown talent. “While we may not be able to travel just now, this film will inspire people for their future visit.” Some of the squeamishness over the sex scenes has been playful, with viewers dubbing the adaptation Fifty Shades of Sligo. Shane Ross, the transport minister, noted that the romance between Marianne and Connell starts with a kiss filmed in Knockmore House in Enniskerry, his childhood home. “I think my parents would be absolutely mortified by what going on in their house, which was a haven of morality,” he told the Irish Independent. “I think it great myself.” However some people were appalled - RTÉ received dozens of complaints. A caller to RTÉ radio Liveline programme last week said the TV adaptation was “porno”. Another said it promoted fornication. The widely reported comments prompted mockery – and an apparent surge in viewership. After the Liveline broadcast RTÉ reported a “highly unusual” level of streaming of Normal People on the RTÉ Player app.",659
43,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/could-lockdown-be-the-death-of-bullfighting-in-spain,"or months the ranchers had laid the groundwork; grazing and exercising a select crop of half-tonne fighting bulls to be transported to arenas and festivals across the country. Then – just as Spain bullfighting season was set to kick off – the country was plunged into lockdown. “It was dreadful,” said Victorino Martín, a second-generation breeder of fighting bulls. “The coronavirus came at the worst possible moment.” The lockdown brought the bullfighting sector to a standstill as Spanish authorities scrambled to control one of the world deadliest outbreaks, with more than lives claimed. Weeks later, though urban hotspots like Madrid and Barcelona remain under lockdown, elsewhere measures have eased , and industries ranging from travel to car manufacturing have turned to the government for help in navigating Spain new normal. No request has been as controversial as that made by the bullfighting sector. Long reviled by animal rights campaigners who see it as cruel and outdated, bullfighting fight for survival has triggered a fierce debate over its future in Spanish society. “The bullfighting sector is – and will be – one of the most affected by the dramatic situation that we’re living through,” bullfighter Cayetano Rivera said recently on social media, after dozens of events, including Pamplona running of the bulls, were cancelled. With the virus threatening to wipe out much of the season, which runs until October, he appealed to Spaniards to consider the tens of thousands of people thrown out of work as the industry struggles. “We can’t forget the many people and families who depend, either directly or indirectly, on the bullfighting world to live.” The estimated loss of income so far is at least said Martín, who also heads the Fundación del Toro de Lidia, which was created in to defend the industry. “Even more concerning is that we don’t know when we’ll be able to restart our activities,” he said. “Meanwhile, the animals continue to eat. You have to take care of them and the employees.” The industry is in discussions with television networks about broadcasting bullfights behind closed doors – a measure Martín hopes could help the beleaguered industry. But with little chance that crowds will be allowed to return to the streets for bull fiestas or into arenas for bullfights, he was steeling himself for his worst-case scenario: cancellation of the entire season. “What industry could survive a year and a half without any income and still cover its costs?” A handful of ranchers have already given up, he said. “There are breeders that have slaughtered all of their animals … I know there was a week where more than were killed.” The economics of that make little sense, as it can cost up to to rear a bull while the slaughterhouse pays he noted. But for those who have bulls that will outgrow the strict age limits on bullfighting and street festivals if they are not used this year, it is one of the few options. The Unión de Criadores de Toros, which represents the interests of some breeders of fighting bulls, estimates that more than bulls had been raised for this year season. The industry has turned to the Spanish government for help, outlining a list of requests that include a rollback of the sales tax on fighting bulls and grants to help breeders. “We want them to treat us as they would any other cultural industry,” said Martín, citing the economic spinoffs for hotels, restaurants and bars generated by events. Their request has been met with stiff opposition. More than people have signed an online petition urging the government not to use public funds to prop up bullfighting. “It outrageous – particularly at this moment, when there are families that don’t have enough to eat and hospitals that have been decimated by cutbacks,” said Aïda Gascón of AnimaNaturalis, an animal rights group that is one of the organisations behind the petition. “Public funds should not be used to promote and pay for spectacles based on the abuse and mistreatment of animals.” Similar petitions have been launched in Portugal and France, where the local bullfighting industries have also asked for government help. “Bullfighting is facing the most critical moment of its existence,” the petition noted. “We have a unique opportunity … to build a world without bullfighting.” The assertion is borne out by Spain last economic crisis, which saw cash-strapped municipalities shift funds away from festivals involving bulls. In one year before the financial crash, Spain held events featuring bulls. Just over a decade later, this number had more than halved, with such events held in Spain economic minister, Nadia Calviño, predicts that Spain GDP could shrink by this year and animal rights groups are pushing for bullfighting to be cut off from public funding. “What we’re looking for is the total abolition of this practice of torturing animals as a form of spectacle,” said Gascón. “One way to do that is to choke off their subsidies … it wouldn’t get rid of the industry completely but it would reduce it to or of what we have today.”",847
44,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/will-coronavirus-lead-to-fairer-societies-thomas-piketty-explores-the-prospect,"The French economist Thomas Piketty is the bestselling author of Capital in the Twenty-First Century and its follow-up, Capital and Ideology a sweep through years of the history of inequality. Speaking to the Guardian, he said he had been thinking about the opportunities this pandemic may present to build fairer, more equal societies. How does this pandemic measure up to historical ones? The most pessimistic modelling estimates of the eventual death toll of this pandemic – that is, without any intervention – are about million people globally. That corresponds to about a third of the death toll of the flu pandemic, adjusted for population. But what missing from the models is inequality – the fact that not all social groups are hit in the same way, and importantly, neither are rich and poor countries. Capital and Ideology by Thomas Piketty review – if inequality is illegitimate, why not reduce it? This was revealed by the flu, where to of the population perished in the US and Europe , compared with in India. What is shocking about this pandemic is the very high levels of inequality that it is revealing. We’re also being confronted by the violence of that inequality, because lockdown in a big apartment is not the same as lockdown if you are homeless. Are western societies more unequal than they were in The levels of inequality we see today are much, much lower than what they were a century ago. In a way that is my message. I’m an optimist. The story I tell is a story of learning, of progress in the long term. That progress happened because of political and intellectual movements that set out to build social security and progressive taxation systems, and to transform our system of property. Property was sacrosanct in the century, but it was gradually de-sanctified. Today we have a much better balance of the rights of owners, workers, consumers and local government. That represents a complete transformation in our notion of property, and it was combined with increased access to health and education. But inequality is greater now than it was in the So a correction is needed? Yes. The right response to this crisis would be to revive the social state in the global north, and to accelerate its development in the global south. This new social state would demand a fair tax system and create an international financial register that would enable it to bring in the largest and richest firms to that system. The present regime of free circulation of capital, set up in the and under the influence of the richest countries – especially in Europe – encourages evasion by millionaires and multinationals. It prevents poor countries from developing a fair tax system, which in turn undermines their ability to build a social state. In Capital and Ideology you describe how shocks such as wars and pandemics can drive such corrections. Is it possible that extreme inequality can even provoke such shocks – in other words, that inequality is self-correcting in the long run? I think there is something to that, yes. In the book I argued that the two world wars were largely the result of the extreme inequality that existed in pre-first world war European societies – both within those societies and internationally, due to their accumulation of colonial assets. That inequality was not sustainable, and it caused those societies to erupt, but they did so in different ways – the first world war, the Russian revolutions, the pandemic. The pandemic preyed on the poorer sectors of society, with their poor access to healthcare, and it was exacerbated by the war. The result of these cumulative shocks was a compression of inequality over the next half-century. The main example you give in the book, of a pandemic driving a correction, is the Black Death of the century. What happened after that? There has long been a theory that the end of serfdom was more or less a consequence of the Black Death. The idea was that with up to of the population wiped out in some regions, labour became scarce and labourers were therefore able to secure better rights and status for themselves, but it turns out to be more complicated than that. In some places, the Black Death actually reinforced serfdom. Precisely because labour was scarce, it became more valuable to landowners who were therefore more motivated to coerce it. IMF boss says raise taxes on the rich to tackle inequality The bottom line, which is relevant today too, is that powerful shocks like pandemics, wars or financial crashes have an impact on society, but the nature of that impact depends on the theories people hold about history, society, the balance of power – in a word, ideology – which varies from place to place. It always takes major social and political mobilisation to move societies in the direction of equality. Could this pandemic tip us towards the kind of participatory socialism that you recommend? It too early to say, precisely because pandemics can have such contradictory effects on political mobilisation and thinking. At the very least, I think, it will reinforce the legitimacy of public investment in healthcare. But it could also have a completely different kind of impact. Historically, for example, pandemics have triggered xenophobia and nations turning inward. In France, the far-right politician Marine Le Pen is saying that we should not return too quickly to free movement in the European Union . Especially if the final death toll is very high in Europe, as compared to other regions, there is a risk that the anti-European narrative of Trump and Le Pen could gain traction. Q: What about public debt, which is soaring as a result of this pandemic – won’t governments be forced to act to rein that in? Yes, that likely. When you get to a very high level of public debt, as our European nations and the US have, you need to find unorthodox solutions because repayment is simply too crippling and slow. History offers us plenty of examples of this. In the century, when Britain had to repay its debts from the Napoleonic period, it essentially taxed the lower and middle classes to repay upper-class bondholders. This worked because, at least at the beginning of the century, only rich people could vote. It the slippery-slope argument – the classic argument of conservatives throughout history Thomas Piketty Today, I don’t think it would work … Following the second world war, on the other hand, Germany and Japan found a different and, to my mind, better solution. They temporarily taxed the wealthy. It worked very well, allowing them to start reconstruction from the without any public debt. Necessity makes you inventive. It could be that to save the eurozone, for example, the European Central Bank will need to take responsibility for a bigger share of member states’ debt. We’ll see. So it could transform the European Union? We shouldn’t rely on a crisis to solve the problems that we need to solve, but it could be a stimulus to change. The EU began to fragment with Brexit. It a weak explanation of Brexit to say the poor are nationalist. The problem is that if you have free trade and a single currency without social objectives, you end up in a situation in which free mobility of capital benefits the most mobile, high-wealth citizens, and you alienate the middle and lower classes. If you want to keep free movement, it needs to be married to common taxation and common social policies, which could include common investment in health and education. History is instructive here too. Building a welfare state within a nation state was already a huge challenge. It required rich and poor to come to an agreement and a big political fight. Doing it at a transnational level is possible, I think, but it will probably have to be done in a small number of countries first. Others can join later if they buy into the ideology. I hope it can be done without breaking the current EU, and I hope Britain comes back, eventually. There has been talk of de-globalisation after this crisis. Will it happen? I think it will happen in some strategic areas, such as medical supplies, just because we need to be better prepared for the next pandemic. There more work to be done for it to happen across the board. At the moment, our ideological choice is to have tariffs on international trade, because the fear is that if we start raising tariffs, where will it stop? It similar to the discussion over the redistribution of property. People preferred to defend even extreme inequality in property ownership – even slave ownership – rather than accept some redistribution, because they were afraid that once unleashed it would end in the expropriation of all property. It the slippery slope argument – the classic argument of conservatives throughout history. Today I think we have to get out of this zero-tariff mindset, if only to pay for global threats such as climate change and pandemics, but that means inventing a new narrative about where we stop with tariffs. And again, as history shows us, there is never just one solution.",1543
45,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/bergamo-field-hospital-russia-putin-italy-politics-aid,"he sprawling trade fair and exhibition centre on the outskirts of Bergamo, the Italian city hardest hit by coronavirus, is now a field hospital. Instead of pavilions and stands there are beds, only of them occupied. Inside the hospital red zone, where the sickest patients are treated, there are almost as many Russian medical staff as patients: military doctors and nurses and eight interpreters, all sent by Moscow in a controversial aid gesture. Accessing intensive care here is a complex process: two layers of protective gear have to go on: first a white hospital gown and then a disposable surgical suit, plastic sandals, gloves, transparent glasses, a transparent welding mask, all sanitised several times with hydroalcoholic gel. . Even then, it hard to feel shielded from the virus that tore through this city and the surrounding region, leaving thousands dead in the space of a few weeks. Volunteer medics from an Italian NGO, who worked on the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone and medical teams from Bergamo Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital which bore the brunt in the first devastating phase of this region outbreak, staff the field facility. But the Russians are instantly recognisable because they brought their own distinctive PPE; white hazmat suits with blue stripes. The Russians also brought their own logo: two hearts, one wrapped in the Russian flag, the other in the Italian flag, conjoined by the words: From Russia with Love. A poster carrying the logo has been stuck on the wall of the field hospital. The controversy in Italy surrounding the Russian presence, which La Stampa newspaper suggested was cover for an intelligence-gathering operation and which others have speculated is either aimed at getting the EU to lift sanctions, or a PR exercise to exploit the EU lack of cohesion , is not something the Russian doctors are keen to discuss. Lt Col Alexander Yumanov, head of the Russian medical team, says: “We do not want to get involved in this political controversy, we are doctors who do their job. There is a tradition in Russia that if someone asks us for help, we have to give it to them.” “We arrived fully equipped, our medical and nursing teams were ready to work from day one, as we had our eight ventilators. We brought another ventilators to Italy as a gift, as well as protective suits, masks, personal protection systems and test kits”. Where were the tests sent? “We suggested that Italy give them to Bergamo, but we don’t know where they ended up”. When are they planning to return to Russia? “These terms have not been defined, for the moment we are trying to give the best of ourselves”, says Alexander Volosatov, the deputy head of media of the Russian defence ministry, who accompanies Yumanov throughout. Are they waiting for everyone to be cured? “We’re waiting for the epidemiological situation to stabilise” Volosatov says. It is still not clear how the Russian involvement came about. A politician from Matteo Salvini pro-Russia Lega party claims he brokered the intervention via the German far-right party the AfD. The colonel says it was a bilateral arrangement between Italy prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the Russian president, Vladmir Putin. “Relations with Italy have always been good” he says. Oliviero Valoti, health director of this temporary hospital acknowledges early concerns about the Russian presence, from a medical perspective. “We were worried about language barrier issues and also cultural issues. In reality I must say that they have proved very efficient. They have aligned themselves perfectly with our approach, both from the therapeutic standpoint and from the clinical management of patients.” Stepping across the wide corridor that separates the different sectors of the hospital, Valoti, an anaesthetist , talks admiringly about the ventilators flown in from Moscow on Russian cargo planes: “All the equipment in there consists of respirators donated by the Russian contingent. These are respirators that do not exist in the west. We have evaluated and used them, they are of the highest quality. They are extremely useful in intensive care.” Guido Marinoni, president of the order of Bergamo doctors, contrasts the Russian intervention with EU solidarity. “Russian military doctors work at the [field] hospital. Albanians, Cubans, Chinese doctors came too. But Germans didn’t come, the French and Americans didn’t come. This might make one think. It not as if there was no coronavirus in China and in Russia.” In fact critically ill patients were airlifted by the Germany military from Bergamo to hospitals with spare capacity in North Rhine Westphalia and Saxony, although the patient transfer scheme began after the Russians’ arrival. Germany also supplied Italy with ventilators while at least eight other EU governments provided protective equipment. Within the wards at the field hospital the patients are mostly male, many elderly and a few under thirty. Mauro Poleni, a technician from Paladina, was transferred here on April. “At the beginning it was a bit strange. I thought it would be difficult to communicate with [the Russians], but the interpreters are good. They intervened promptly when I had a fever of Infection rates and hospital admissions in Bergamo are now falling, and the city youth are eager to resume their lives and jobs when lockdown is eased on May. But traumatised by the losses in the city and villages of the surrounding valleys – officially the province of a million people lost people, but the real toll is estimated to be closer to – many older people remain wary. Dr Marinoni expresses a similar concern about resuming as before: “If we do not make sure that a gradual return is accompanied by a control of the infectious capacity of people going back to work, we are in dramatic danger of this taking off again”.",958
46,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/what-is-the-future-for-travel-and-immigration-in-age-of-covid-19,"Our globalised world has been brought to a crashing halt by coronavirus. By April, over of the world population – billion people – lived in countries with coronavirus-related travel restrictions on people arriving from abroad, a Pew study found. And while local lockdowns are starting to ease in many countries now, the pause on international travel is likely to last far longer. With countries still focused on staving off a second wave of infections, there is little appetite for rapid reopening. “Travel and immigration – for work, study, seeking asylum – is going to be disrupted much longer than our daily lives, in a way unprecedented in our lifetimes,” said Prof Lindsay Wiley from the American University Washington College of Law. Senior figures in the aviation industry have already said they expect it to be several years before passenger demand returns to levels, if it ever does. Greece tourism minister, Harry Theoharis, recently told the Guardian that although the country is desperate to protect its economy, long-haul flights to its islands and beaches are almost certainly out this year. Countries that acted fast to bring the disease under control – at least for now – are exploring ways to open up a limited “bubble” for their citizens to travel without restriction. The first to discuss the idea were New Zealand and Australia. Nine countries scattered across the world, but united in their successful handling of the virus are also actively seeking ways of setting up travel bubbles or corridors, broadening an unlikely alliance. In their second meeting via teleconference on Thursday, the leaders of Austria, Greece, Israel, Norway, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand agreed that as each begins to ease restrictions they could capitalise on low infection rates by creating tourism safe zones. Israel, Greece and Cyprus – tourist-dependent nations – are already discussing the idea in the eastern Mediterranean, and hoping to partially open up from July. On Wednesday the European commission is expected to recommend a three-phase approach to reopening borders that brings together member states with “similar overall risk profiles”. Any reopening would be very gradual however, with authorities prepared to shut back back down if the virus re-emerges. “A month in an epidemic is a very long time,” said Cyprus’ chief virologist professor Leondios Kostrikis. And beyond these bubbles, travel is likely to be severely curtailed either by outright bans, or by quarantine rules. The UK, a laggard on quarantining by international standards, outlined its own plans at the weekend . The incubation period of the disease means most countries are requiring two weeks isolation on arrival. If that is enforced in both departure and destination countries, it would mean a month under lockdown in total, in order for travellers to spend any time working or relaxing somewhere else – effectively putting an end to most business and tourism travel. These partial or total closures, while they may protect public health, come with a huge economic cost to countries dependent on tourism or other types of travel, like international students flying in for a university education. That burden might help attempts to reaccelerate opening of borders. “For a place like Hawaii or Iceland, or maybe New Zealand, you are talking about pretty dramatically restructuring your economy not to be dependent on inter-state or international tourism [and travel],” said Wiley. “You can protect yourselves by isolating the entire jurisdiction, but then you have to think through how you restructure your whole economy if you aren’t going to allow travel.” Yet even partial, controlled re-opening to travel carries risks. The disease long incubation period means the most up-to-date information on current infections may still miss the latest clusters; countries that seem disease free may be nursing fresh undetected infections. New York outbreak provides a recent example of how ineffective travel bans can be; it appears to have been driven by cases from Italy, brought in after the US government halted entry of people coming from China but not from Europe . “My worry is that travel bans become a distraction from appropriately managing local transmission, that what happened in the US, where we could have had a policy of ‘test trace, isolate’, and the focus was on the travel bans instead,” said Alex Phelan, professor at Georgetown University Centre for Global Health, Science and Security. “As it demonstrated, if you are going to be putting bans in place against countries, you are always going to be acting on data that is out of date.” And no travel ban is absolute; global supply chains mean people will continue travelling to transport goods, and most land borders are somewhat porous, so viruses can slip across with smuggled goods. “We human beings often have tried to forestall epidemics by shuttering, by drawing up the drawbridge, and there is no question that travel can spread some types of disease. But it also much harder than we imagine to contain,” said Wendy Parmet professor of law, public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern University. “This virus is extraordinarily contagious. New Zealand is an island (nation), they may be the one place that can. I certainly don’t think the US can, or the countries on the Eurasian continent can.” Other options to try to restart travel before a vaccine is developed could include tests shortly before travel either for antibodies to prove immunity, or for the disease itself to prevent infected people travelling. There is precedent for requiring either immunity or virus-free status for travel; travellers coming from places with yellow fever are required to have a vaccination certificate for the disease to enter countries from Australia to India and Mexico. At a time of concern about the climate impact of flying, there are suggestions that some of the slide in travel could and should become permanent. And some businesses are already embracing the savings in costs and carbon that have been forced on them. “We had over billion air passengers globally before the lockdown,” said Monika Büscher, professor of sociology at Lancaster University, whose research work includes decarbonisation of transport. “Now all the business travellers are learning to zoom, and business analysts suggest that to of the workforce will be doing this (permanently) by France has said its bailout of national carrier Air France will be dependent on the airline eliminating short domestic flights where the trip could be made by train. And the enforced end of travel may change expectations around business travel in a positive way, said Prof James Faulconbridge, head of the Department of Organisation, Work and Technology at Lancaster University. “Many of those meetings never needed to happen through travel anyway, but there was a sort of expectation, a working practice that associated travel and going to meet people as a way of doing business, a sign of commitment.” Mass international travel only emerged a couple of decades ago; it is possible that habits could change dramatically again. “Its easy to forget that it was only around the turn of the century that levels of travel we now accept as normal started to emerge,” he said. “So a reset that changes our presumption around travel is not as radical as it might appear.”",1198
47,world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/canada-wetsuweten-historic-deal-land-rights-pipeline,"A group of Indigenous leaders have struck an unprecedented deal with Canada government to resolve a dispute over territorial rights near the site of a controversial pipeline project which provoked fierce protests, police raids and a nationwide rail blockade. At a virtual signing ceremony on Thursday, hereditary chiefs of the Wetuwet’en people agreed to a memorandum of understanding with the federal government and the province of British Columbia – a landmark agreement many hope will grant the Wetuwet’en title rights to sq km of territory. Canada: protests go mainstream as support for Wetuwet'en pipeline fight widens The planned talks follow a wave of protest across the country in February in support of Indigenous activists in remote camps attempting to block the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline. The three-way agreement also marks a rare decision by the federal and provincial governments to negotiate directly, bypassing a costly and fraught treaty process that typically takes decades moving through various levels of negotiation. The relationship between Canada federal government and First Nations is still governed by legislation drawn up in the colonial era. But ambiguities within the Indian Act leave ample room for confusion over rights to land – and who speaks for the Indigenous people in the country. Tensions came to a head in recent months, after the company Coastal GasLink won a court injunction to continue construction of its multibillion-dollar project, a third of which would cross through Wetuwet’en traditional territory. The project has the support of elected First Nations councils along the proposed route. Five of the six elected band councils in the Wetuwet’en nation also support the pipeline – but Wetuwet’en hereditary chiefs do not, and say the band leadership doesn’t have the authority to negotiate such agreements. The federal government typically only negotiates with First Nations band councils and their democratically elected leadership. But Wetuwet’en hereditary leaders have long claimed authority over a large swath of northern British Columbia arguing that they never signed any treaty to cede the land. Few expect the negotiations will be straightforward: there are few playbooks for the government to draw on when negotiating rights and land titles. In Canada supreme court ruled the Tsilquot’in nation in British Columbia had retained title to territory they had traditionally occupied . That victory paved the way for the current negotiations – but it came after nearly years of court battles. Legal expert Signa Daum Shanks says she suspects the federal government realized it could face hefty legal costs if they were to fight the Wetuwet’en in court and lose. “I suspect Canada is making some decisions about fiscal costs they might incur if they’re proven wrong over this in the next decade,” Daum Shanks, a professor of Indigenous governance and history at Osgoode Hall Law School. Negotiations over the deal have also pitted different levels of Indigenous leadership against each other. Elected Wetuwet’en chiefs in the region say they have been left out of the talks and have called for the agreement to be scrapped. In a statement released on Monday, the leaders of four elected band councils say Wetuwet’en hereditary leadership were “treated us improperly and failed to adequately inform us regarding the proceedings and processes that have taken place to date”, following six hours of virtual discussion. “To ignore their clan members and elected councils, something is terribly amiss,” said the statement. Further complicating matters are complaints from several Wetuwet’en women who were once hereditary chiefs – but who were recently stripped of their titles and replaced by men. “The government has legitimized the meeting with the five hereditary chiefs and left out the entire community,” one of the women, Theresa Tait-Day of the Wetuwet’en Matrilineal Coalition, told the Canada Press. But early disagreements do not mean the talks are doomed, says Daum Shanks. “The conflict we see needs time to percolate further and does not automatically mean that this big deal is botched. The sky is not falling.”",657

In a video shot from a passing car, the tiger can be seen trotting along a sidewalk, while the man with the lasso – along with another carrying a folding chair and a third man – chased the feline. “Diós mio!” exclaimed a woman on the video, shot from the safety of a passing car. Record death tolls in Mexico and Brazil add to fears of surge in Latin America “How are they going to catch it,” a second woman in the car asked nervously. “I don’t know,” her friend responded. The footage shows a car pulling over in front of the tiger, blocking the sidewalk and forcing the animal to turn around. The man with the lasso then twirled it above his head and threw the rope around the tiger neck – just off camera – as the animal tried to dart off down the street. The short video has been viewed thousands of times, and offered Mexicans an absurd respite from the crisis, during which there have been more than infections, and a brief return to the strange news cycles Mexico has seemed to perpetually produce. “Tiger King, Mexico version?” asked one tweet . Others speculated on who might own a tiger since Mexican circuses are no longer to use animals in their shows. Some drug cartel bosses are believed to keep to keep wild animals as pets. Details on the tiger and the men pursuing it remain scant. None of the three men has been identified and none has spoken to the press.

There are plans for primary schools in England to start a gradual reopening from the start of next month, with the youngest children in formal schooling – four and five-year-olds in reception – among the first expected to return. However many teachers are unhappy at the plans with the UK death toll, the second worst in the world, still climbing.

Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped alleys of the camps in the Cox Bazar district, where the persecuted Muslim minority have been housed in canvas and bamboo shacks since they fled a military offensive in neighbouring Myanmar more than two years ago. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organisation later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area. “One patient is from the refugee population and the other one from the surrounding host population,” WHO spokesman Catalin Bercaru told AFP .

0,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/labour-welcomes-pms-conversion-on-obesity-after-coronavirus-scare,"Labour has hailed a “welcome conversion” by Boris Johnson as Downing Street confirmed that the prime minister hopes to lead a public health drive, having blaming his stint in intensive care on obesity. The prime minister was hospitalised with coronavirus last month and spent several nights in intensive care at St Thomas hospital in London. Several slimmer colleagues, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Johnson chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, escaped with milder symptoms. Asked about reports that Johnson had joked with aides that “thinnies” are not as prone to the worst effects of the coronavirus and now wants to lead a “war on fat”, his official spokesman said: “As we outlined in our recovery strategy, this government will invest in preventive and personalised solutions to ill health, helping people to live healthier and more active lives. “You have heard the PM speak on a number of occasions about the importance he attaches to cycling.” The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: “We’ve repeatedly warned of the long-term health risks of obesity. If the prime minister now supports extending the sugar tax and banning junk food advertising before the watershed, then that a welcome conversion. We are facing an obesity crisis, and decisive action is urgently needed.” However, No denied that Johnson was considering increasing the sugar tax – the levy imposed by George Osborne to encourage food companies to reformulate their products. That would have been be a considerable turnaround from Johnson stance during last year Tory leadership contest, when he announced a moratorium on “sin taxes”, claiming that they hit the poorest consumers hardest. Johnson has generally been against “nanny state” interventions in the public daily lives, an instinct some critics blamed for the government reluctance to take draconian lockdown measures in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis. The government has not so far enacted plans set out in a green paper on preventive health in the final days of Theresa May premiership, which included consulting on a ban on junk food advertising before Early research has suggested that obesity may be a significant factor in determining the severity of cases. Johnson spokesman said the government was examining the importance of this and other criteria. “It is critical to understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could be disproportionately impacting how people are affected by coronavirus,” he said. “Public Health England launched a review into the factors affecting health outcomes from coronavirus, to include ethnicity, gender and obesity, and this will be published by the end of May,” he added. The outcome could help the government tailor its advice to different groups during the coming months as the search for a vaccine continues. Several officials have said Johnson is entirely serious about the plan to improve public health, and is particularly focused on pushing through plans to get more people walking and cycling. One issue with this has been to ensure local authorities take the necessary action, but if central government provides financial support to regional transport systems, as has happened with Transport for London, the hope is that pressure can be exerted for rapid progress. As well as improving public health, the government is keen to ensure that as many people as possible who are returning to work as the lockdown eases avoid public transport. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced the allocation of of his department budget last week for creating “emergency” cycle lanes, widening pavements and other interventions aimed at encouraging the public to get around using “active travel”.",589
1,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/lib-dem-election-campaign-a-car-crash-says-partys-review,"The Liberal Democrat election campaign last year was “a high-speed car crash” worsened by structural failures, poor tactics, and an inexperienced inner circle around Jo Swinson , an internal party review has concluded. The report , led by the Lib Dem peer Dorothy Thornhill, says an already hugely difficult campaign was further hampered by errors including hubris over the number of seats the party could win. Despite pre-election predictions from some Lib Dems of gains of or MPs, the December election saw the party slump from its defection-fuelled tally of MPs to just with Swinson among those losing their seats. The report notes that while Swinson was hampered by having less than five months between winning the party leadership and the election, her decision to immediately seek a new party chief executive undermined decision-making structures. “This had the unintended consequence creating an ‘inner circle’ of advisers at arm length from the resources of the party machine, and put decision-making in the hands of an unaccountable group around the leader,” the report says. “It also severed some people from the roles and responsibilities they were employed to do, and led to the overpromotion of others.” The report, based in part on almost survey responses from Lib Dem members and officials, said Swinson tactic of promising to revoke Brexit if the party won a parliamentary majority meant the party “effectively ignored” the biggest group of voters: those who were neither fervently remain or leave. While painting a picture of a party almost drunk on the euphoria of initially high poll ratings and unable to detect that the picture had shifted, the report stresses the role of both a dysfunctional internal structure and what was always going to be a difficult election. “The overarching conclusion of the review is that had we made much better decisions in we might have gained a few more seats, but not many more,” it says. The Lib Dems’ current interim leader, Ed Davey, praised the report as brave and powerful, saying in a series of tweets that in future the party should be “rooted in our communities, putting the interest of our communities first, and we need to speak with a clear voice”. The report identifies as one key moment the release of a poll before Swinson took over as leader, amid the peak of the Brexit chaos under Theresa May, which put the Lib Dems on seats and within a swing of more. This prompted the abandonment of plans to fight potential new seats as serious targets in favour of a list that rose to and then despite worries from activists about a lack of resources to battle on so many fronts. The expectations swelled towards the party hugely buoyant autumn conference, and then an election launch at which Swinson was presented as a potential prime minister. This happened, the report noted, despite worrying signs, such as Labour backing a second Brexit referendum. The party, concluded the report, suffered from “an optimism that was to maintain itself even when the evidence started to turn against it”. Before the election was called, the report says, the party faced two unpalatable choices: ally with Labour to stop Brexit, but risk a collapse in tactical voting from Tory voters alarmed by Jeremy Corbyn; or delay an election for as long as possible, even if Brexit took place. “Instead we chose to claim to believe we could win outright ourselves, thus obviating the need to choose,” it says. “It is this lack of clarity which led to an election campaign that can only be described as a high-stakes gamble for a once-in-a-lifetime election, to stop Brexit by winning outright. It was a gamble which did not pay off.” The election, which the report summarised as “a high-speed car crash”, was marked by poor on-the-ground campaigning, as exemplified by the loss of Swinson East Dunbartonshire seat, and a central message that Swinson could be PM which “appeared unrealistic to the wider public, especially given that we were already falling in the polls”.",671
2,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/no-10-under-pressure-as-it-is-revealed-whitehall-chief-mark-sedwill-had-coronavirus,"No is facing questions about why it did not disclose that Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK most senior civil servant, had coronavirus at about the same time as Boris Johnson, Chris Whitty and Matt Hancock were struck down with the illness. The revelation – many weeks after Sedwill was diagnosed – means that almost all the senior people in charge of the UK coronavirus response had the illness in late March or early April. It raises particular questions about why Johnson allowed a crucial cabinet meeting to go ahead on Tuesday March, one day after the lockdown was imposed, which was attended in person by Whitty, the chief medical officer, Hancock, the health secretary, and Sedwill, the cabinet secretary. Johnson, Hancock and Whitty confirmed they tested positive for the virus two days later. Dominic Cummings, Johnson chief adviser, was also later confirmed to have had coronavirus at about the same time. Sedwill was working at home throughout his illness but No did not reveal at the time that he had tested positive. When asked almost daily at briefings about the state of Sedwill health, Downing Street said he was “fine” or working as normal. Sedwill, who is also national security adviser, is the most powerful civil servant in Britain. Asked whether the public had been misled, Johnson official spokesman said that he personally only became aware recently that Sedwill had been ill and that the cabinet secretary had continued to work over that period. The spokesman did not have the exact dates that Sedwill had coronavirus but Civil Service World reported that he tested positive in April and was ill at about the same time as Johnson. Asked why Sedwill illness and the date he tested positive had been kept from the public, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: “After experiencing mild symptoms the cabinet secretary tested positive for coronavirus in April. In line with the government guidance, the cabinet secretary self-isolated. He continued to lead the civil service implementation of the government response to coronavirus throughout this period.” Downing Street has already been criticised for allowing daily press conferences to continue without physical distancing in place while the crisis was underway. In the last week of March, when the lockdown was imposed, Johnson, Hancock, Sedwill and Whitty all chose to attend in person. Another senior figure to have had the virus at about that time was former scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling team at Imperial College influenced the decision to impose a lockdown.",415
3,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/brexit-serious-risk-eu-uk-citizens-michael-gove,"The British government has said there is “a serious risk” that the European Union will fail to meet its duties to protect the rights of UK nationals living in the bloc, in the latest sign of tensions over Brexit. In a letter to the European commission, Michael Gove said British residents living in the EU had raised concerns, while the coronavirus pandemic had diverted the attention of many governments from implementing the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which is intended to protect the rights of an estimated million British nationals in the EU and million Europeans in the UK. There is “a serious risk that the EU will not fulfil its obligations under the withdrawal agreement by the time the transition period ends on December said Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He added that the government was “already seeing several instances of misapplication of the withdrawal agreement”, which, although “localised incidents”, made it harder for British nationals to exercise their rights. The letter comes at a tense moment in EU-UK relations, with both sides expected to report later on the latest round of talks, which conclude on Friday morning. One of the government criticisms is the lack of official campaigns in EU member states to raise awareness about new requirements for UK nationals – a stipulation under the treaty. France and Spain, home to large numbers of UK migrant workers and retired people, are deemed not to have done anything proactive to raise awareness among British residents. The Czech Republic and Hungary have published information that is thought to be confusing or out-of-date, without translation into English. In contrast – the government says – information on the settlement scheme for EU nationals in the UK is available in other EU languages. In Austria and Slovenia the government is concerned British nationals have only six or seven months to secure their rights, whereas EU nationals in the UK have months. Other EU member states, such as Malta, Cyprus and Slovakia, are faulted for relying on face-to-face meetings with local officials, rather than offering people the option to secure their status online. Gove complains that some countries have still not provided detail on what their application processes will entail. The government is also concerned about limited attention to vulnerable UK citizens, with Gove stating that member states have not shared information about help for elderly, hard-to-reach or other vulnerable citizens, adding that “in many cases there appears to be none”. In contrast the government says the UK has given to help community organisations support vulnerable EU nationals, with a further due in It also reports earmarked to help support British nationals in the EU. Gove represents the government in the Joint Committee, an EU-UK group set up to monitor compliance and implement the Brexit withdrawal treaty, which came into force when the UK left the EU on January . The letter is addressed to his opposite number, the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič. While EU governments are responsible for protecting citizens’ rights, the government has called on the commission – the ultimate enforcer of EU law – to step in. The letter echoes some complaints made by European politicians over the treatment of EU nationals in the UK. The government revealed last month it had received applications from people seeking to stay in the EU through the settled status scheme . The EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he had paid “close attention” to Gove letter. While he did not say whether he shared the British government analysis of the problems facing British citizens, he promised the commission would be vigilant, adding that guidance had been published for national authorities to implement the citizens’ rights part of the withdrawal agreement. “We will do the necessary dialogue with each of the member states concerned,” he told reporters.",635
4,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/labour-urges-tory-mps-to-admit-keir-starmer-video-was-doctored,"Downing Street has rebuked Conservative MPs, including a minister, for sharing a video from a far-right Twitter account that falsely claimed Sir Keir Starmer obstructed the prosecution of grooming gang members when he led the Crown Prosecution Service. A Downing Street spokesman said the MPs, including Nadine Dorries , a health minister, had been spoken to by whips after sharing the misleading clip. The video was shared by Dorries as well as the Telford MP Lucy Allan and Maria Caulfield, who represents Lewes. All commented at what the video purported to show, with Dorries calling it “revealing”. The No spokesman said: “These tweets have rightly been deleted. The MPs involved have been spoken to by the whips’ office and reminded of their responsibility to check the validity of information before they post on social media sites.” The clip, from falsely claims to show Starmer apparently recounting reasons why victims of grooming gangs might not be credible, talking about “the assumption that a victim of child sexual abuse will swiftly report what happened to them to the police; will be able to give a coherent, consistent account, first time; that they will not themselves have engaged in any offending or other behaviour; and that they will not have misused drugs or alcohol at any stage”. The original tweeter, who also regularly posts anti-Islam messages and other far-right content, titled the clip: “Keir Starmer explains why he didn’t prosecute grooming gangs when he was head of the Crown Prosecution Service.” However, a fuller version of the video shows this is completely misleading. Starmer is in fact explaining why he had changed the prosecution guidelines, to move away from “a number of assumptions, which didn’t withstand scrutiny”. Allan wrote in her retweet: “This suggests a total failure to understand grooming, a dismissive attitude towards CSE [child sexual exploitation] victims and a belief that the victims brought it on themselves.” Caulfield retweeted the video with the message: “True face of the Labour leader #shameful.” Speaking during an online event with Welsh voters, Starmer said: “As I understand it, it a doctored video that has been shared. I understand Nadine Dorries deleted it, which is the right thing to do. It doctored, it false, it not true.” A Labour source said: “This is a doctored video tweeted by a far-right social media account. As a government minister, we hope Nadine Dorries acknowledges this and takes it down.” Dorries later did remove her tweet, as did Allan. However, Allan did not delete an earlier reply to another tweet referencing the video in which the MP said: “Unbelievable. This is what CSE victims were up against.” Caulfield appeared to delete her entire Twitter account. None has yet apologised for sharing the misleading message. As director of public prosecutions, Starmer ordered a wholesale restructuring of how the CPS dealt with grooming cases, saying the legal system had failed victims. The issue of grooming gangs and authorities failing to properly target abusers has been regularly used by far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson to campaign against Muslims. In Dorries retweeted a post from Robinson.",515
5,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/grants-shapps-imitates-chris-tarrant-to-show-the-uks-out-of-lifelines,"or the second time in six days Grant Shapps was asked to do front of house at the daily Downing Street press conference. Let that thought sink in for a moment. Given that Shapps is a man clearly out of his depth in a puddle, there can only be four explanations for this. Either the relatively competent ministers, such as Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock, have said they’re going to work to rule from now on and limit their appearances. Or Boris Johnson knows there are so many duds in the cabinet – Where Priti? – that Shapps is the best he got. Or Grant has managed to convince Boris that he actually two separate people; that his alter ego of Michael Green is a real person. Or – and this is the most likely – the government has admitted defeat and has chosen to turn the briefing into a piece of Dadaist performance art. The coronavirus deconstructed through interpretive dance. Not that Shapps isn’t a trier. His natural level is as a salesman flogging dodgy cleaning appliances in the graveyard slot of an online shopping channel. But for the press briefings he has made an effort to up his game by doing his impersonation of Chris Tarrant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Smile glued on, boundless enthusiasm and a huge round of applause for Emma from Walsall who will be going home tonight with a bumper prize of Shapps began with the tricky terms and conditions of today coronavirus competition. Some tests had been completed in the previous hours. OK so some of them were on the same people and many of them were kits that had been mailed out, but it was still a new record for the show so could everyone please show their appreciation. The transport secretary then mentioned the daily death figure. This was very sad, he said. Though he didn’t sound particularly sad. Mostly because difficult, negative emotions aren’t in his repertoire. He didn’t want the audience to be sad. So how about another big shout out for the UK having the highest fatality ratings in Europe ? Just think of the commercial revenue that could generate if there were any businesses left with spare cash to spend on advertising. After a brief recap of the government new messaging service – Stay Alert because the guidelines of both to Stay at Home and Go Back to Work were thoroughly confusing – Shapps got stuck into the gameshow proper. He didn’t want anyone to go home unhappy, so how about thinking of all the cheerful things about the pandemic? With no one using the trains, Network Rail had had plenty of time to upgrade the infrastructure and was now well ahead of schedule on some projects. And with far fewer people using their cars, the road improvements to the had been completed seven months early. Felix from Felixstowe, you will be going home with Who wants to be a two billionaire? Shapps did. Which is why he was able to announce a special cash bonus for roads and rails, with dedicated just to filling potholes. At the back of the studio, the show producers had a minor heart attack. No one had told them Chris/Grant was going to start spending their money like this. Within minutes, the department of transport had had to issue a clarification. The minister had got a bit carried away. The wasn’t actually new money. He was merely re-announcing money that had already been promised. Still, no one would care by the time the show was repeated on The starter questions from the public proved to be unusually tricky. Helen wanted to know whether universities would be going back in September and if her son should take out a loan for an education he wasn’t going to get. Shapps grinned and commiserated. That a question he would like answered himself as he also had a son at university. Perhaps he could phone a friend. Predictably Gavin Williamson didn’t answer his call. Shapps also had to ask the audience when questioned about deaths in care homes as he didn’t have a clue what the answer was. Using Boris as your role model when preparing for a press conference is maybe not such a good idea. “Um in Europe, the death rate in care homes is he said cheerfully. “But in the UK it was only So if old people did their bit by dying a bit quicker, we would soon be as good as the Italians and Spanish. Can’t have Johnny Foreigner outperforming us on mortality figures. The rest of the presser was just as unilluminating. Shapps is a model of equal opportunities in not knowing anything about anything. He didn’t know about the antibody tests but he was pleased that it was a positive question. He likes positivity. He had no idea of how many elective operations had been cancelled, but as he had used up all his lifelines, could he just say he hoped it wasn’t really that many. Nor did he know quite what to do about bailing out Transport for London. Shapps is as bewildered as Boris that asking people to go back to work and social distancing are frequently mutually exclusively pastimes. “I’m going to answer this question head on,” he said confidently. Head on as in avoiding it completely. When it came to the big ticket question on camping and caravan holidays, Shapps chose to bank what he had got. He’d be going home with Though the real figure was probably nearer Just a shame it was the dead and not pounds sterling.",939
6,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/boris-johnson-resorts-to-bluster-under-keir-starmer-cross-examination,"n Monday Boris Johnson was singing the praises of “good old-fashioned British common sense”. A higher order of common sense than French or German common sense, naturally. So it unfortunate that this is the very quality he seems to singularly lack. Because you’d have thought the one thing Boris might have learned from his first time up against Keir Starmer at prime minister questions last week was that it would be a help to come properly prepared. But Boris has never done preparation for anything. It not in his nature. Preparation is for girly swots. He is a tabula rasa who treats every day as a new beginning. One free from the consequences of any past actions. He is the macho blagger who has always been able to wing it, fuelled by a few gags and some hasty last-minute revision. Something that might have been good enough, when backed up by a full chamber of braying Tory MPs, to see off Jeremy Corbyn, but that is proving hopelessly inadequate against a top QC in a near-silent courtroom. Things are now so bad that every time Boris opens his mouth, he only encourages the jury to convict him and the judge to increase his sentence. It also possible that Starmer has made the same mistake as many people in severely overestimating Boris intelligence. That the long words and the Latin phrases simply cover up the fact the prime minister isn’t particularly bright: after all, it takes a very special type of cleverness to keep making the same mistakes over and over again. But then old habits die hard for the leader of the opposition too. He has learned from his time at the bar that there no such thing as having too much evidence against a defendant, so he was taking nothing for granted by coming to the Commons somewhat over-prepared. Give it time and Boris may well cut to the chase and just plead guilty in advance to save him the torture of answering six questions, but we’re not there yet, so Starmer opened his folder and asked the court to consider Exhibit A. Care homes . Was it not true that the government had been far too slow to act to protect the most vulnerable members of society? Absolutely not, Boris insisted. No country had done more to protect the elderly. What better protection could anyone get than being killed? Hmm. That was weird, Starmer said, because in Exhibit B he had a surgeon quoted in the Daily Telegraph – citing the newspaper that up till now had been only too happy to print any old rubbish the prime minister writes was a cruel twist of the knife – saying that the government hadn’t changed its advice on releasing untested patients into care homes until mid-March. That not just true, Boris blustered, sounding guiltier by the second. Even though it was true. Though to accuse the prime minister of lying is to commit a philosophical category error. As Boris has no clue what advice his government has and hasn’t given, he can’t knowingly be untruthful. Nor, given his career track record, show any signs of being able to differentiate between truth and lies. Rather he just recites the answer that he wants to be true and hopes to make it so by willpower alone. And to be fair, it a tactic that worked often enough in the past. Starmer moved on to the Office for National Statistics figures for deaths in care homes. Their report suggested there had been an excess death figure of people, yet the government was certain that only of them had died of the coronavirus. So what did he think the other had died of? Boris shrugged. It was a huge mystery. Perhaps some were dying of happiness. Or of over-exertion in the gym during lockdown? Or perhaps they were dying of disappointment that the UK still had not technically left the EU? “I’m baffled,” said Starmer. Baffled is QC speak for ‘Now I’ve got you nailed, you filthy lying toerag’. Baffled that the government had stopped using the international death rate comparison at the Downing Street press conference, having done so continuously for the past seven weeks. Boris blustered yet again. It turns out that a prime minister who was supposed to be such a great communicator can now barely talk in joined-up sentences. He has regressed to the pre-verbal stage. “Um … er … ah,” he mumbled. There was little left of the prime minister but a sodden mess by the time Keir had finished with him, though the SNP Ian Blackford was happy to make a few ripples of his own in the pool of blubbery sweat previously known as Boris. All that Johnson could say in his defence was that his was a roadmap of consensus – the consensus being that he hadn’t bothered to consult Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It appears he was surprised to learn there were so many people in London who needed to use public transport. In other times it might have been uplifting for the opposition benches to see the prime minister so comprehensively dismantled. But there was little cheering or a sense of satisfaction, because in a time of crisis you rather hope the country would have a leader in whom you could believe. Someone you could trust to make at least some of the right decisions. But we have Boris. Incompetent, unprepared, selfish, lazy, amoral, and just not that bright. And no matter how many times Starmer batters him with an indefensible charge sheet at PMQs , Boris will remain prime minister for the duration.",942
7,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/the-tfl-congestion-charge-rise-is-down-to-a-good-old-power-struggle,"Good old-fashioned politics rather than economic, environmental or health considerations seem to explain the decision by Transport for London to reimpose the congestion charge from Monday, hike it by next month, and to also restrict free travel for the young, the elderly and the disabled. TfL to raise congestion charge by as part of bailout deal Put simply, a power struggle is taking place between London Labour mayor and TfL on one side of the table and a Conservative government on the other. The row is about the size and the strings attached to a government bailout needed because of the massive drop in numbers using public transport in the capital. Stuck in the middle are the citizens of the capital, many of whom are already struggling to make ends meet. The congestion charge was originally introduced to make London traffic flow more freely and the air cleaner. It was suspended at the start of the lockdown in the hope that car travel would help keep the capital ticking over, especially by making it easier for key workers, including nurses, to drive to work. In recent days the government has urged workers to use cars to travel wherever possible, because it is currently safer than public transport. It is also encouraging cycling and walking. The mayor also wants Londoners to stay away from public transport. He wants them to walk, cycle, or stay at home, but not use cars. TfL says its cash crisis means it has no choice but to reintroduce the congestion charge from Monday and to raise it from a day to next month. Older and dirtier vehicles will also have to pay the Ulez (ultra-low emission zone) charge of a day, which has also been suspended in lockdown. The basic laws of economics suggest that whacking up the congestion charge provides an incentive to find other ways of getting around. But the continuing need for social distancing means there isn’t the capacity on the tubes and buses to take more than a fraction of London usual workforce. The second option is to follow the example of cities such as Amsterdam, where people cycle and walk more than they do in London. Amsterdam, though, has a population a tenth the size of London. It is often not feasible for low-paid workers, forced to live in the less expensive outer boroughs of London , to get to work on their bikes (even assuming they have one). The third option is to suck it up and pay the higher congestion charge. But many of London workers – the builders, shopworkers, delivery drivers, plumbers, midwives and security guards – are not highly paid. For them, the stand off between City Hall and Westminster means putting their health at risk or seeing a bigger slice taken out of their already low incomes.",471
8,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/27/brexit-adviser-david-frost-to-lead-uk-trade-negotiations-with-eu,"Boris Johnson has appointed David Frost, his chief Europe adviser, to lead trade negotiations with the EU on his behalf, with no apparent role for Liz Truss, the trade secretary. Frost will be the direct counterpart of Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator for the future relationship, with civil servant deputies from the Foreign Office and Treasury. He will lead a task force, reporting into the Johnson Downing Street, now that the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) is due to shut down on January. It leaves no role for Truss amid speculation her department could be rolled into the business department as part of expected changes to machinery of government next month. Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will lose his role on Friday at and the DExEU civil servants are being redeployed. However, he may be handed back a job in the impending reshuffle, which is linked to changes in Whitehall departments. There is speculation the FCO may gain control of the Department for International Development, that the Department for Trade could merge into the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and that energy could be made into an independent department again.

9,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/no-deal-brexit-how-likely-is-it-what-would-be-impact,"No-deal Brexit , crashing out, or a departure on WTO terms – call it what you will, it seems increasingly possible the UK could experience this on October. How could it end up happening? And what would it mean? How might no deal happen? No deal is the default – without a withdrawal agreement in place it takes place automatically on October. A new deal seems increasingly unlikely given that Boris Johnson and his ministers have demanded terms – scrapping the Irish backstop and an entirely new withdrawal deal – that have been repeatedly rejected by Brussels and would be hugely ambitious anyway given the deadline. Could it be stopped? It seems a majority of MPs still oppose a no-deal departure, as they did in March . It nonetheless remains unknown if the Commons can block Johnson if he is intent on such a Brexit, whether or not proroguing parliament is possible . MPs would need to create the circumstances for a binding vote and it is unclear how this might be done. It is worth noting here that some in Westminster see a government intent on no deal being blocked by parliament as Johnson preferred scenario – allowing him to call an election as the self-styled champion of Brexit. What does ‘no deal’ actually mean? It would simply mean that at UK time on October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. This would drop the UK out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. What impact would there be? To a great extent this is a leap in the dark, given the multiplicity of factors involved, but a number of sectors are deeply worried. With meat farming, there would be an immediate WTO tariff on exports to the EU, which could instantly wipe out many farming businesses. Other UK firms that export to the EU would need to apply for customs, excise and VAT procedures, or they could not ship goods. Delays due to border checks, which many business groups warn could soon become very long , would have knock-on effects for firms reliant on a constant stream of supplies. For individuals, there are concerns about supplies of medicines , and the potential that travellers to the EU might need to go through extra checks. Essentially, for both businesses and individuals, the potential list of impact is very long and cannot be completely predicted. What mitigation measures are in place? The government began preparing for possible no deal ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March, passing legislation to cover areas such as nuclear material, money laundering and road haulage, and moving thousands of civil servants to make no-deal plans. While some warn that the government is still less prepared for an October no deal, planning has been stepped up under Johnson, with Michael Gove handed a cross-government cabinet role to lead on this , complete with a select cabinet sub-committee. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has promised extra funds in the event of no deal and could put together an autumn budget intended to rejuvenate the economy. The government is also reportedly spending up to on an advertising campaign to let businesses and people know how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. What would it mean for the Irish border? It would involve checks of some form, whatever the UK government insistence that it will not impose any infrastructure. As the Irish government has pointed out repeatedly , Ireland cannot remain a part of the EU single market and allow the unmonitored flow of goods across what will then become a customs, standards and regulation border. While there is an understandable desire to avoid infrastructure on the frontier – which has so many crossing points it is virtually impossible to completely police anyway – some new system of checks would come into place. How would it affect other government plans ? This is a question which the Johnson government has, as yet, not answered, particularly in the context of the many tax cuts and spending plans so far unveiled. Much of this has been based on the idea of using some or all of the or so of “fiscal headroom” – extra borrowing that would be permitted within current limits – to pay for this. However, Treasury forecasts say this money would evaporate in the economic hit of no deal. On the campaign trail Johnson said the government could instead use the divorce settlement with the EU. However, this is not a credible plan, as the sum covers a series of already-agreed UK commitments paid over a number of years. Some of the money could not be clawed back, and to renege on other payments would severely damage the UK financial credibility. Would it mean Brexit is finally over? No. One of the biggest appeals about a no-deal Brexit for voters who support it is the idea of “getting it over with”, absorbing whatever chaos takes place and moving on to other priorities. But this is a fantasy. The UK could not trade perpetually on WTO terms and would need to make a permanent trade deal with the EU – involving just the same issues as before, such as a divorce payment, and arrangements for the Irish border. The main difference is that this would all need to happen as quickly as possible, without the buffer of a transition period running to the end of",983
10,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/brexit-will-mean-checks-on-goods-crossing-irish-sea-government-admits,"The government has privately conceded there will be post-Brexit checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, months after Boris Johnson insisted there would be no such trade barriers. In a letter to the executive office in Stormont the government confirmed there would be border control posts in three ports, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Larne. Declan Kearney, one of the two junior ministers in the executive office, the regional equivalent of the Cabinet Office in London, confirmed the details at a select committee session in Belfast on Wednesday. He told members of the local assembly that officials had briefed the executive on Monday. “The sum total of that, and without breaching executive confidentiality … [is that the] British government has confirmed it will urgently put in place detailed plans with the executive, which does include the physical posts at ports of entry,” said Kearney. The prime minister agreed checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain in a breakthrough meeting in Wirral with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, last October. However he was then accused of misleading the public after he was recorded on video telling local businesses weeks later that there would be no checks. If any business was asked to fill in extra paperwork, they should telephone the prime minister “and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin”, he told them. The Northern Irish protocol is part of the withdrawal agreement signed in January after Johnson led the Conservative party to an majority in December. It will kick in next year whether there is a deal on trade or not. The EU had become increasingly exasperated with Johnson claims that there would be no checks. Fears that the UK would backslide on the deal were fuelled by the refusal of Johnson government to allow the EU to open an office in Belfast to help implement and enforce the protocol. The paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, told the EU such a presence would be “divisive in political and community terms”. The Brexit deal is unpopular across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland because of the extra costs and bureaucracy it will entail for businesses. But it also means checks on the border with the Republic of Ireland will be avoided, something that has the support of Sinn Féin, and that exporters will have access to both the domestic and EU single market. The South Down Sinn Féin MP, Chris Hazzard, has said the British government must live up to the commitments made on Brexit, particularly in relation to the Irish protocol. “The British government cannot be allowed to renege on their legal obligations and must now work with the EU and the executive to ensure those commitments are fulfilled as a matter of urgency,” he said. Business have called for some of the paperwork including the entry and exit declaration forms for imports and exports to be waived, along with health certificates for each product coming to a local supermarket. Analysis by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium of deliveries from Britain to high-street supermarket chains in Northern Ireland found that firms could incur costs of more than per lorry unless special Brexit derogations were agreed. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: “We have always been clear that there will be requirements for live animals and agri-food, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast. “We want to work with NI businesses and the executive to ensure new admin procedures are streamlined and efficient. The protocol puts legal obligations on both sides. We are committed to complying with ours, just as we expect the EU to comply with theirs.”",603
11,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/devastated-jo-swinson-apologises-lib-dems-election-failure,"Jo Swinson has apologised to the Liberal Democrats for a dismal election in which she lost her seat and the party slipped to MPs, but said she did not regret fighting on a defiantly pro-remain platform. Naming some of the MPs ejected as her party lost of its pre-election tally of including the Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, and all the recent defectors from the Conservatives and Labour, Swinson said: “I’m so sorry I couldn’t get them re-elected.” In a speech to party activists, Swinson said she had been an “unapologetic voice of remain in this election”. The stance prompted some criticism inside the Lib Dems, notably the pledge to revoke Brexit without a second referendum if the party won a majority. “Obviously it hasn’t worked,” Swinson said. “And I, like you, am devastated about that. But I don’t regret trying.” Castigating what she said was the failure of the Conservatives and Labour to tackle racism in their ranks, Swinson said she was fearful for the future: “Our country is in the grip of populism, with nationalism resurgent in all its forms.” Swinson stepped down immediately as party leader, a job she took in July, after losing her East Dunbartonshire constituency to the Scottish National party by votes, a seat she had regained in Ed Davey, the Lib Dem deputy leader, and Sal Brinton, its president, will take over as joint interim leaders before a leadership election in the new year. In her speech, Swinson hinted strongly that she would like her successor to be a woman, naming and praising the party seven female MPs, three of them new. “I’m proud to have been the first woman to lead the Liberal Democrats , and even more proud that I know I won’t be the last,” she said. After a buoyant autumn conference at which party insiders cited seats as a likely minimum benchmark for an election, Swinson led the Lib Dems to their second-worst performance in the party modern history, better only than the slump from to eight seats in While the party had a significant gain in vote share on Thursday, up to from the in the new leader will face a postmortem into a campaign centred on courting remain-voting areas. The Lib Dems lost all the defectors from other parties who had swelled their number of MPs to Among those who fell short were the former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger, and the ex-Conservative Sam Gyimah, who had been placed in London seats seen as winnable. Other former Tories such as Phillip Lee and Antoinette Sandbach also lost. However, the party held on to some close-run seats in Scotland , and had some success in a handful of remain-minded seats. In Richmond Park, south-west London, Sarah Olney removed the Tory minister Zac Goldsmith. In a speech during which her voice broke with emotion several times, Swinson warned that racism “has now become mainstream” in politics. She said: “Many people will look at the last few weeks, at these results, and be filled with dread about the future of our country. I understand. I am worried too.” She added: “We have been true to ourselves, and true to our liberal values. And as your leader I have been true to myself, too. As a Scot, a Brit, a European. As a liberal, a humanist, a feminist. As a daughter, sister, wife, and a mum to two small kids.” She ended by appealing to hope for “a way out of this nationalist surge”, saying: “Next week is the shortest day. We will see more light in the future. Join us for that journey, let explore the way together, with hope in our hearts.” Dennis Skinner to Zac Goldsmith: election winners and losers Several of the Lib Dems’ losses, like that of Swinson, were very close. In Sheffield Hallam, previously the seat of its former leader Nick Clegg, the party lost by votes to Labour. But elsewhere the Lib Dems were hampered by what seemed to be a lack of effective tactical voting, not least because in some seats it was not clear whether they or Labour were the better option for anti-Conservative locals. In the north London seat of Finchley and Golders Green, Berger lost by more than votes to the Tory incumbent, Mike Freer, with the third-placed Labour candidate polling more than votes. Similarly, in the Cities of London and Westminster seat, Umunna losing margin to the Conservatives, just under was significantly less than the won by Labour. But in Kensington, where Gyimah had been touted by the Lib Dems as a likely winner, he came a fairly distant third, with his votes contributing to Labour losing the seat by just votes.",784

Despite predictions of a close contest, the party deputy leader won almost two-thirds of the votes cast by members to defeat Ed Davey and replace Vince Cable , who had been in the post for two years. Lib Dems are bouncing back, but revival is not guaranteed She is the first woman to hold the role and, at is the youngest current leader of a major UK party, despite having first been elected to Westminster in After the result was announced to cheers at an event in central London, Swinson paid tribute to Cable, with whom the Lib Dems have tapped into anti-Brexit sentiment and reached their best poll ratings since performing strongly in the local and European elections. Swinson laid out the party battle against Brexit and sought to portray it as a pro-environment, non-extreme bulwark against newly resurgent forces unleashed by Brexit. “Liberalism is alive and thriving, in the face of nationalism, populism, the catastrophe of Brexit. The two old parties have failed,” she said. Addressing a crowd including Chuka Umunna, the former Labour and Change UK MP who recently switched to the Lib Dems, Swinson appealed to others to change sides. The party is known to be in talks with MPs from the Conservatives and Labour in the hope of tempting at least some new recruits. “This is the time for working together, not the time for tribalism,” she said. “And my message to MPs in other parties who share our values is this: if you believe our country deserves better, that we can stop Brexit, that we can stop Johnson, Farage and Corbyn, then work with us, join us. My door is always open.” Swinson won votes against for Ed Davey, on a turnout of Her victory comes a day before the Conservative leadership election result, when Boris Johnson is widely expected to defeat Jeremy Hunt to become the new prime minister. Swinson was scathing about Johnson, citing his lack of condemnation for Donald Trump recent tweets and his unwillingness to support the UK ambassador in Washington, Sir Kim Darroch. “I rage when Boris Johnson is more interested in sucking up to Donald Trump than standing up for British values of decency, equality and respect,” she said. “Tomorrow, we expect Boris Johnson will take the keys to No but he has shown time and time again that he isn’t fit to be prime minister. Boris Johnson has only ever cared about Boris Johnson. Just ask Sir Kim Darroch or Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe . Whether it is throwing people under the bus or writing a lie on the side of one: Britain deserves better than Boris Johnson.” Much of the party recent campaigning has been based on opposing Brexit; the yellow-and-black banners around the venue featured big “Stop Brexit” slogans. Swinson spelled out the message: “Our party has been clear on Brexit from day one. We believe the UK best future is as members of the European Union, and that why, as your leader, I will do whatever it takes to stop Brexit.” Paying tribute to Cable, Davey and former party leaders including the late Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy , Swinson prompted loud applause by arguing that recent polling numbers of up to during an atomisation of party loyalties meant the Lib Dems could aim big. Has Brexit saved the Lib Dems? - podcast She said: “I stand before you today, not as just as the leader of the Liberal Democrats, but as a candidate for prime minister. There is no limit to my ambition for our party and for our movement. I am ready to take our party into a general election and win it.” As the first female leader of a party which has struggled in the past to make its pool of MPs more representative, Swinson tackled this in her address. “Our liberal movement to take on nationalism and populism must be inclusive,” she said. “At one hustings, someone accused me of being a feminist first and a liberal second. I answered how can you be a liberal, if you are not a feminist?” She ended with an appeal for tempted voters to stop “shouting at the television” and sign up. “If you want an economy that works for people and for our planet. If you want to build a richer, greener and safer future. If you want to keep our family of nations united. The answer is simple. Come, join us. Let do this. Let do this together.” Davey later tweeted : “Huge congratulations @joswinson - you will be a great leader to take our message of hope, respect and love for others across the country and build a Liberal Britain. Thanks to @vincecable for taking us to this point; thanks to my supporters and team. You’ve all been incredible.” Cable took over from Tim Farron following the general election, when Farron managed only a relatively small gain in the party number of MPs – from eight to – well down on the in the election, after which the Lib Dems went into coalition with David Cameron Conservatives . There had been pressure on Cable to go after what was seen as a sometimes uninspiring performance as leader, but the former business secretary was buoyed as the party climbed in the polls.",922
13,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/i-can-be-next-pm-says-jo-swinson-as-she-launches-election-campaign,"Jo Swinson has formally launched the Liberal Democrats’ election campaign with a remain-dominated message, insisting she can become prime minister but declining to specify what the party might do if it holds the balance of power. Swinson told an event in Westminster that Brexit and other political shifts had made December election hugely unpredictable, and that she believed her party, which took just under of the votes in and is polling at about now, could win a majority. “Don’t let anyone tell you what has to happen. Change is possible, and you get to choose,” the Lib Dem leader said in her message to voters. “I never thought I’d stand here and say that I’m a candidate to be prime minister. But when I look at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, I am absolutely certain I could do a better job than either of them.” In reality, senior Lib Dems say privately that even doubling the party current tally of MPs in the election would count as a significant success, meaning a more realistic outcome would be to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament. Lib Dems accused of using misleading data on election material In her speech and answering subsequent questions, Swinson reiterated her stance that the Lib Dems would not actively support either Johnson or Corbyn as prime minister. Asked if she could back a Labour government, she was scathing about its leader. “On so many grounds, Jeremy Corbyn is not fit for the job of prime minister,” she said. “On the biggest issue of the day, he has prevaricated and will not give a straight answer. Even now if you ask him whether he is remain or leave he will not tell you how he would vote. “His plans for the economy would take us back to the I believe he would be a threat to our national security.” But asked to outline any details of what the party would do – for example supporting Labour if Corbyn was no longer in charge – Swinson declined to do so, saying only: “As Liberal Democrat leader, what I am offering to the public is a Liberal Democrat government.” The Lib Dems are part of a remain-based voting alliance with Plaid Cymru and the Greens, under which parties will stand down in each others’ favour in some seats, with details on the plan due later this week. Asked why the alliance could not be extended to remain-minded Labour MPs in ultra-marginal seats such as Rosie Duffield in Canterbury, Swinson said she admired many things about Duffield but added: “She still the Labour party. And people in the Labour party are standing on a manifesto that going to be about delivering Brexit. It about putting Jeremy Corbyn into No That not something that we can support.” She also condemned Johnson, noting what she said were similarities to the US president: “With his big lies, his brash promises and his attitude to women, it pretty clear who Boris Johnson is modelling himself on – Donald Trump.” In her speech, Swinson highlighted the new Lib Dem campaign pledge of a “remain bonus”, which the party argues would be made available for public services over five years by protecting the economy through stopping Brexit. The party policy, agreed at its autumn conference , is that it would revoke Brexit without a referendum in the admittedly unlikely event it won a majority in the Commons, or else would push for a second referendum. Asked how a Lib Dem government could unite the nation, Swinson argued that there was not a Brexit plan that commanded majority support across the county. “As Liberal Democrats we are standing up for what we believe in, and being very honest and straightforward about that,” she said. “I recognise there are differences of opinion on this issue, and I think people recognise and appreciate that we are consistent and we are firm in what we are standing for.” While Brexit dominated her speech, Swinson said EU membership was emblematic of the Lib Dems’ wider approach, arguing: “It is about who we are as a country. It about the choices that we make – whether or not we think it a good idea or not to work with other countries, with our closest neighbours, to meet our shared challenges. It is about recognising that our humanity does not stop at our borders.” The election, she argued, would shape “the future of our country for generations to come”. Swinson said: “This is not a normal election, it not a typical choice of whether you want the red team or the blue team to be in government for a few more years.”",781
14,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/19/lib-dem-election-failure-was-corbyns-fault-says-acting-leader,"The acting Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has claimed the “toxicity” of Jeremy Corbyn was a big factor in the Lib Dems’ poor performance in last month general election, saying voters backed the Tories rather than risk a “hard left” government. Davey was defeated by Jo Swinson in last year Lib Dem leadership contest and is expected to stand again after Swinson lost her East Dunbartonshire seat and resigned. He conceded that his party “didn’t fight a great election,” but said the Lib Dems had also been hit by voters’ fears about giving Corbyn Labour the keys to Downing Street. “In any election there are forces that you can control, and forces you can’t control. And there no doubt that the toxicity of Jeremy Corbyn to people who might have voted for us was greater than might have been expected,” Davey said. His party had hoped to make significant gains in Conservative-held remain constituencies but in the event gained only a couple – St Albans and Richmond Park. “You had liberals who were centrist but were very worried about a hard left government. This is what happened in with Foot, in with Kinnock,” Davey said. On the doorstep, he said, “we’d get: ‘We really like you guys, we agree with you on “stop Brexit”, but we’ve got to stop Jeremy Corbyn.’ There no doubt that was a big factor.” Davey conceded that his party revoke message on Brexit had been poorly communicated and ended up alienating both leavers and remainers. The Lib Dems said in their manifesto that they would revoke article if they formed a majority government. “Communication was the problem, and that clearly didn’t work with some people,” Davey said. “It was particularly tricky for leave voters; but also, funnily enough, it annoyed remain voters too.” The party federal board announced on Saturday that a new leader would not be chosen until July, allowing time for a review of the party disappointing general election performance. Davey said he would like to use that time to show that the Lib Dems were not a “one-trick pony” and had policies across a range of issues aside from Brexit. “We have to be more than a one-trick pony, and we always have been, but we haven’t always managed to get that over,” he said. In particular, he wants to highlight the need for better provision of care – an issue that affects him personally, as he has a disabled son. “I want to lead a centre-left party who wants to see Britain be way more caring and progressive in how we reach out to people who need help. I want to change the culture and change the debate,” he said. “I now have a disabled son, who and one of the things I have learned from that, and from conversations with people, is one of the things you worry about is who is going to care for them when you’re not there.” Asked whether he had a particular model in mind for funding an expansion of care provision, he said: “Clearly, how you pay for different kinds of care needs to be thought through. For some kinds of care, it completely reasonable to ask the individual to make contributions, so I’m not suggesting it all goes on the state. However, there are a whole range of examples where you couldn’t possibly expect people to make provision.” He used his first prime minister questions as acting Lib Dem leader to challenge Boris Johnson over cuts to the financial support that bereaved families receive. Davey said that in principle he would be prepared to join cross-party negotiations that Johnson has promised to set up to consider how best to fund social care for elderly people. But, despite reports suggesting the prime minister wants the committee up and running in his first days, Davey said his party had not yet received an invitation. As a former energy and climate change secretary, Davey said he would also be highlighting the need to take more urgent action to tackle the climate emergency in the next few months. Other potential candidates to be the Lib Dems’ fourth leader in three years include the party education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, and the new MP Daisy Cooper.",707
15,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/lib-dems-warned-not-to-back-december-election-vince-cable-tim-farron,"Senior Lib Dems warned their party against backing the December election that Boris Johnson had been demanding, it has emerged. Vince Cable , Tim Farron and Phillip Lee are all said to have raised serious concerns about the party surprise move to offer the prime minister the chance of an election. Opposition parties had previously been united in opposing the move. It is understood they told party officials that keeping Johnson locked in a minority government, inflicting parliamentary defeats and fostering Tory infighting would have given them a much better chance to plan and fight an election in the spring. Tactical voting was set to be Remainers’ saviour, so what went wrong? The Observer broke the news that the Lib Dems, along with the SNP, were planning to offer Johnson a December election. Once they made the offer, Labour opted to back the December election a few days later. Lib Dem insiders said there was resistance to the December election plan, warning that supporters of the idea had become obsessed with internal polling in the wake of May European elections suggesting the party would be competitive in well over seats. “Hubris was the problem throughout,” said one. The election ended in disaster for the party, with leader Jo Swinson losing her seat and the Lib Dems finishing with one fewer MPs than in – an outcome unthinkable at the outset of the campaign just six weeks ago. Swinson has blamed the decision by the Brexit party to pull out of many seats for the Lib Dems’ struggles, while others believe her exclusion from televised leaders’ debates was a key development. Defeated Lib Dems also pointed to the party unpopular pledge to revoke Brexit without a referendum. Lee, who lost in Wokingham despite a large swing to the Lib Dems, confirmed he had opposed an election. “Having the election in the first place was a bad decision,” he said. “I did my best to try to stop that because we hadn’t exhausted the effort to get the last parliament to back a people vote . We bet the house on Nigel Farage not stepping aside. On the doorstep, our unnecessary revoke policy put us on the back foot and our national campaign didn’t cut through to people. We were also fighting fear of Corbyn. In defence of our party, we had great policies, particularly around childcare, climate change and energy efficiency, and mental health services. East Dunbartonshire weighs up its future after Jo Swinson defeat “But as soon as the BBC decided not to be impartial and to frame the choice as Corbyn versus Johnson, the game was over. For the future, the liberal progressive centre has to present a credible alternative to rightwing populism and nationalism.” However, party sources said the “prevailing view” was that the Lib Dems had to back an election because there were signs Johnson had the votes to force through his Brexit deal. There were also concerns that the EU would not allow another Brexit extension. The Lib Dems are now in search of a new leader, with MP Ed Davey and peer Sal Brinton taking temporary charge. The Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran is seen as the favourite to replace Swinson.",538
16,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/jo-swinson-lib-dem-apologises-for-backing-coalition-austerity-policies,"Jo Swinson has repeatedly apologised for her role in austerity measures under the Lib Dem-Conservative coalition after she was pressed in a BBC interview over why her party is seeking to roll back several measures she voted for in the administration. “I am sorry that I did that. It was not the right policy. And we should have stopped it,” the Lib Dem leader said, when asked by Andrew Neil if she wanted to apologise to people affected by the bedroom tax, saying her party would reverse the policy. Swinson , who is facing criticism of her tactical decisions and voter appeal in a campaign which has seen the Lib Dems’ poll rating gradually slip, also said she would remain as leader even the party ended up with fewer than the MPs they began the election with. “I’m continuing as Liberal Democrat leader,” she said. “I’ve got a job to do and I’ve just been elected to do it.” Asked if she would remain regardless of the result, she replied: “I’m here to stay and we’re going to get a great result.” Swinson is among the leaders of all the main political parties to undergo a grilling from Neil, with the exception of Boris Johnson, who is refusing to agree to an appearance. The quizzing on benefit cuts began with Neil noting that the Lib Dems wanted to scrap the bedroom tax , which cuts benefits for people living in social homes with more rooms than they are deemed to need . “Who voted nine times to introduce the bedroom tax?” he asked. “The Liberal Democrats in government, including myself,” said Swinson, who held various junior ministerial roles from to She added: “Which I have previously said – and I’m happy to say again – was wrong. And I’m sorry about that, and it was one of the things that we did get wrong.” Is Jo Swinson election campaign punching below its weight? Swinson also acknowledged that while in the coalition she backed the benefits cap, which limits the maximum benefits income a family can receive regardless of circumstances, and private tendering in the NHS – all of which she now wants to reverse. Asked why voters should trust her, Swinson said: “Clearly we didn’t win every battle against the Conservatives. We fought many battles and we did win battles for more money for schools, for more money for the poorest pupils, for managing to cut tax for the lowest paid. To introduce same sex marriage. There many things that I’m very proud of where we made a difference. “But of course, of course there were things where we didn’t win those battles, and I’m sorry about that. It was not a Liberal Democrat government, it was a coalition government.” Swinson has faced criticism for beginning the election campaign with the argument she could become prime minister. Asked about this by Neil, she said: “Clearly, when you look at the polls that not the most likely scenario. I will certainly grant you that.” Earlier on Wednesday, a campaign visit by Swinson to a youth centre in Streatham, south London, was disrupted by protesters from the Extinction Rebellion protest group, dressed as bees. One of the activists glued his hand to the windscreen of the Lib Dem battle bus. Extinction Rebellion is targeting every party. Other members, also dressed as bees, lay on the floor of the Brexit party office in Grimsby, while others later glued themselves to the Brexit party bus. Swinson met the protesters, arguing with them that the Lib Dem target of becoming carbon neutral by was realistic and could be shortened as technology advanced.",607
17,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/30/vince-cable-calls-lib-dems-pledge-to-revoke-article-50-a-distraction,"Former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has called the party policy to scrap Brexit without another referendum “a distraction and not a very helpful one”. After Jo Swinson replaced Cable in July, the party adopted the policy to support revoking article and cancel Brexit without a second referendum, were the party to be elected into office. Jo Swinson says exist and patronising' Boris Johnson unfit to be PM During a BBC Question Time leaders’ special last week , Swinson was forced to defend her party position. “I don’t think you could accuse us of not being upfront about wanting to stop Brexit ,” she said. However, speaking on BBC Radio Today programme on Saturday, Cable said the focus should have been on a second referendum instead. He added: “I’ve always argued that actually it was wildly improbable. We were never going to get MPs, so the policy had been and should be to argue for the People Vote, going back to the public, to the referendum with support for remain. “So the revoke was a distraction and not a very helpful one.” In September, Sir Norman Lamb, a former Lib Dem health minister who is standing down as an MP, said the policy was “playing with fire”. “I don’t feel personally that there are enough people out there trying to find ways to reunite our country,” he told the Today programme. “I think that the polarisation that we are seeing is incredibly dangerous. I think we are playing with fire in many ways.” Since the start of the general election campaign, the Lib Dems have been squeezed in the polls, with Swinson popularity figures also declining. Last week, Cable said there was a only a “one in a million” chance that Jeremy Corbyn would become prime minister as he predicted there will be a hung parliament, a referendum and another general election. He also criticised the parties’ promises to spend “more and more and more”, describing the spending pledges as “real Father Christmas stuff”.",334
18,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/11/what-is-covered-in-the-uk-governments-lockdown-easing-plan,"Following Boris Johnson Sunday night broadcast , the government has released a strategy document, Our Plan to Rebuild , setting out how the UK will gradually ease lockdown measures. The first changes in “step one” of the process will be introduced on Wednesday Step one Work Anyone who cannot work from home should now consider travelling to work if their workplace is open. Employers have a duty to ensure the workplace is safe, and the government says it has given people guidance on how to run a safe working environment. Workers are asked to cycle or walk to work as much as possible or travel by car, to reduce use of public transport, and to avoid peak times. Employers are being asked to consider finding more car parking and bike spaces and to provide changing rooms so staff can change clothes for work. Workers coming into contact with others during their shifts should consider washing their clothes more often. The virus can stay on surfaces for up to hours, so there should be regular disinfecting where possible. Bosses are also being asked to consider allowing staggered start times. Workplaces should be well ventilated. Schools It is too early to open schools in step one, although the government is asking local councils to encourage vulnerable pupils and the children of critical workers to go to school. The government is amending its guidance to clarify that paid childcare, for example by nannies and childminders, can take place as long as they adhere to the government guidelines on staying safe inside the home, which includes regular handwashing, washing clothes, keeping a place well ventilated and considering more activities outside. Travel Everybody should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible. The government says it will increase funding and give new statutory guidance to encourage local authorities to widen pavements, consider road closures in cities and create pop-up cycle lanes. Exercise Unlimited outdoor exercise means you can go out as many times in a day as you like, but you will still not be able to use areas such as playgrounds or outdoor gyms, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. You can exercise with up to one person from outside your household, which means no team sports unless every participant is from the same household. Social contact As long as you adhere to the two-metre physical distancing rules, you can meet up with one person from outside your household, like a friend or relative, in a public place. Outdoors You can drive to an outdoor place no matter how far from your household, as long as you adhere to physical distancing. However, the rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which means people from England should not travel to parts of the country that are not adhering to Boris Johnson “step one” plan. Face coverings These are not mandatory, but if you can then you should wear one on public transport and in some shops. They should not be worn by children under two years old. Shielding This should continue for extremely vulnerable groups, who should stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact. For example, those who have had an organ transplant or are receiving chemotherapy or renal dialysis. People aged over those with specific, chronic, pre-existing conditions, and pregnant women, are “clinically vulnerable” and should minimise contact with others outside their households, but do not need to be shielded. The document said it is likely that the government will advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to shield beyond June – the end of the current period. Step two These measures are for England and are reliant on the risk level at the time of making a final decision. The first day of June is the goal for the following measures, but this is flexible. There would be hours’ notice of any changes. Schools A phased return for early years settings and schools. Schools should prepare to open for more children from June, with early years, reception, year and year to return in smaller classes. Secondary schools could begin some face-to-face contact for years and pupils, who have key exams next year. All children could return to school before the summer for a month, depending on scientific advice. Shops Non-essential shops could reopen from June on a phased basis. Pubs, cafes and restaurants, and beauty services would not be allowed to reopen at this point because the risk of transmission in these environments is higher. Sport and culture Cultural and sporting events will be allowed to take place behind closed doors for broadcast. Social and family contact The government says it wants to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions while continuing to limit the risk of chains of transmission. One measure could be allowing two households to share childcare to create a “social bubble”. The government is considering looking at allowing small weddings. Step three These measures will be considered for introduction on July. If all the five tests are met and there is scientific advice that suggests further changes are acceptable, the government plans to reopen remaining businesses such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, beauty salons, places of worship and cinemas. These places must meet safety guidelines. Some venues which by their design make physical distancing difficult may not be able to reopen at this stage.",894
19,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/pmqs-keir-starmer-presses-boris-johnson-over-care-home-deaths,"Boris Johnson has been accused by Labour of not knowing the government advice on coronavirus after he told Keir Starmer at prime minister questions that it “wasn’t true” that the care home sector had been advised it was unlikely to face an outbreak. In a tricky series of exchanges in the Commons, Starmer put Johnson under intense pressure to explain the extent of care home deaths. Johnson also declined to say why the government had stopped publishing daily international comparisons of deaths now the UK had the highest number of fatalities in Europe and the second highest in the world. Testing for coronavirus in UK care homes a ‘complete system failure’ Opening his questioning, Starmer noted new figures indicating that of all UK coronavirus deaths had taken place in care homes, and he asked why it was that until March the main government advice was that it remained “very unlikely” that people in care homes could be affected. “Does the prime minister accept that the government was too slow to protect people in care homes?” the Labour leader asked. Johnson said: “No, and it wasn’t true that the advice said that. Actually, we brought the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown. And what we’ve seen is a concerted action plan to tackle what has unquestionably been an appalling epidemic in care homes.” Johnson said it was “absolutely true that the number of casualties has been too high”, but he insisted the government was reversing the trend on deaths in care homes. Starmer responded: “I’m surprised the prime minister queries the advice of his own government up to March.” Labour later published a link to a government web page on advice to the care sector, which says it was “very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected”. The page says the advice was withdrawn on March. Starmer asked Johnson whether he agreed with the reported view of a hospital doctor that government policy had “seeded” the epidemic in care homes by transferring patients from hospitals. Johnson said discharges into care settings went down in March and April and that testing had been done. Pressing the prime minister about official death statistics released on Tuesday, Starmer asked him to explain why there appeared to be more deaths than average in April, even beyond those officially attributed to the virus. He said: “Now I know the government must have looked into this. So can the prime minister give us the government views on these unexplained deaths?” Johnson did not reply to the question, saying only that was “an appalling disease which afflicts some groups far more than others”. Starmer replied: “The prime minister says that solving the problem in care homes is crucial, but that can only happen if the numbers are understood, and therefore I was disappointed that the prime minister didn’t have an answer to the pretty obvious question as to what are those unexplained deaths.” Labour later announced that Starmer had written to the prime minister asking him to correct the record. Juxtaposing Johnson comments and the official advice from which he had quoted, Starmer wrote: “At this time of national crisis, it is more important than ever that government ministers are accurate in the information they give. Given this, I expect you to come to the House of Commons at the earliest opportunity to correct the record and to recognise that this was official government guidance regarding care homes.” During PMQs , Starmer also asked why a chart showing worldwide death comparisons had been dropped from Tuesday daily No press conference. Johnson replied that seeking such comparisons was “premature because the correct and final way of making these comparisons will be when we have all the excess death totals for all the relevant countries.” He urged Starmer to “contain his impatience”. Starmer said: “The problem with the prime minister answer is it pretty obvious that for seven weeks when we weren’t the highest number in Europe they were used for comparison purposes, but as soon as we hit that unenviable place they were dropped.” No refused to accept that Johnson had been wrong about the guidance, and declined Starmer call for the prime minister to correct the record in parliament. Johnson press secretary claimed that Starmer had “inaccurately and selectively quoted from the guidance”, as he had wrongly used the word “remains” and not quoted the first half of the sentence. They argue Starmer wording therefore failed to make clear that the guidance was reflecting the then current position based on low community transmission, not a future prediction. However, the guidance did use the word “remains” and referred to the future saying: “It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected.” Denying that the government was wrongly trying to split hairs, Johnson press secretary said: “The point we are making is that it not true what the leader of the opposition says.” Downing Street also confirmed that the international comparison of death rates by country had been dropped from the slide at the daily press conference, but denied it was because of embarrassment that the UK is showing the second worst toll after that of the US.",878
20,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/11/party-leaders-from-across-uk-attack-boris-johnson-over-muddled-messaging,"Opposition leaders have rounded on Boris Johnson for sending out confusing and muddled advice that they claimed could cost lives as the government attempts to move away from the coronavirus lockdown. MPs in the Commons criticised the change of the government message from “stay at home” to “stay alert”, questioned whether Johnson could still speak for the entire nation, and called for new work guidelines to be published before employees are expected to return on Wednesday . Johnson denied that he has been acting as the prime minister of England after the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland rejected Downing Street new slogan. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said Johnson had struggled to hold the nation together and failed to provide clarity and reassurance to concerned citizens. “There not consensus either on messaging now or on policy between the UK government and those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, not something I know he [Johnson] wanted to see but now we’re in that position, [which] raises serious concerns, with a real danger of divergence,” he said. “What the country needs at this time is clarity and reassurance and at the moment both are in pretty short supply.” The SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called for Johnson to accept that Scotland would continue to use the government previous “stay at home” message, even as the prime minister urged the UK public to “stay alert”. “Will the prime minister confirm that he accepts and respects that in the devolved nations the advice clearly remains ‘stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives’?” he asked. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, asked if Johnson could confirm that he was acting as prime minister of England. Johnson rejected the criticisms, telling MPs the government was offering good advice for the whole of the UK. But he accepted that different places may need different policies in the short term. Johnson address to the nation on Sunday prompted concern from unions and opposition politicians about the lack of a clear message. The government then published further details on Monday in a document called Our Plan to Rebuild, which recommended wearing face coverings in crowded places and allowed further activities in outside spaces such as meeting friends. The document set out a three-step “second phase” of lockdown. Starting on Wednesday, people will be actively encouraged to return to work if they cannot work from home. From June, if the R rate of the spread of the virus remains below one, some schools and businesses will reopen and sporting events will be allowed behind closed doors. Potentially from July, some remaining businesses such as hairdressers and social spaces such as cinemas and pubs will be allowed to reopen. Johnson told MPs that the divergence of advice across the UK should be temporary. “The government is today submitting to the house a plan which is conditional and dependent, as always, on the common sense and observance of the British people and on continual reassessment of the data. That picture varies across the regions and home nations of the United Kingdom, requiring a flexible response. “Different parts of the UK may need to stay in full lockdown longer but any divergence should only be short-term because, as prime inister of the UK, I am in no doubt that we must defeat this threat and face the challenge of recovery together.” Johnson said he has asked the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to examine when the government could safely allow people to expand their household group to include one other household. He also said parents unable to access childcare should not be expected to go to work. Businesses across the country should be “Covid secure” and the Health and Safety Executive would enforce the rules, the prime minister said. “We will be having spot inspections to ensure businesses are keeping their employees safe.” People should not be travelling to a second home for a holiday, Johnson said. Asked by Fay Jones, the Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, if the government new strategy was a green light for tourism or for people to travel to their second homes in Wales, Johnson replied: “We don’t want to see people, let me repeat, we don’t want to see people travelling to another home for a holiday or to a second home.”",724
21,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/keir-starmer-failing-renters-coronavirus-labour-momentum-says,"Momentum and thousands of Labour members have accused Keir Starmer of “failing renters”, calling on him to back an immediate cancellation of rents for those whose income is affected by the coronavirus crisis. Starmer policy is to support an extension of the three-month ban on evictions and give tenants up to two years to pay arrears, which Labour says would help avoid people losing their homes in June. However, activists are calling for a more comprehensive policy to help renters, saying a deferral of rents will push people further into poverty as they face huge rises in what they have to pay each month. Labour urges extended eviction ban amid risk of huge job losses A letter signed by at least Labour members, backed by Momentum , the leftwing grassroots group that supported Jeremy Corbyn leadership, called on Starmer to improve the policy. Momentum has emailed its members urging them to support the letter, which is also backed by Open Labour, a soft-left pressure group, who said: “Deferring rent payments is not enough. We encourage our members to sign and support #CancelTheRent .” In the open letter, the members write: “Deferrals do not confront the loss of income experienced by private renters, nor do they delay the eviction process. Universal credit is too slow-moving and not nearly enough to keep landlords from demanding rent. “Unfortunately, private renters cannot with much confidence look to the Labour party for comfort. While reforms to Universal Credit are welcomed, the Labour Party revised position of rent deferrals does not help us as workers. It simply pushes the problem down the road.” It says Starmer solutions are “simply not good enough” and amount to “failing renters”, arguing that three months of deferred rent will end up in a rent increase over two years. The letter calls on Labour to “pressure the government to cancel, at the tenant request, payments of rent, for any tenant experiencing any drop in income” and “cover, at the tenant request, utility payments, for any tenant experiencing any drop in income”. A spokesman for Starmer pointed to a defence of the party policy by Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow housing secretary, who said: “The five-point plan aims to prevent arrears and debt primarily if possible and to minimise it and prevent evictions if not. There are huge problems with the housing system, which needs fixing. Right now we are trying to make sure people don’t lose their homes. ”The policy is that the government should support and protect people incomes to prevent arrears if possible, and prevent evictions if not. That doesn’t solve the whole housing crisis – that needs regulation of private rental sector, investment in truly affordable homes.” She also highlighted an analysis by a legal expert that warns of unintended consequences if rents are completely cancelled as the state would have to compensate landlords, estimating the cost to the state at up to a month and claiming it would be “deeply regressive, giving the biggest benefit to those who don’t need it, [with] free money for the already reasonably well-off”. The Green party has used Starmer policy on renters as an opportunity to outflank Labour on the left and appeal to renters. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said she disagreed with Labour, arguing that “leaving renters struggling with debt is unfair and will increase homelessness”. She said: “Instead, forgive arrears and let landlords who need it claim for support. Most renters already stretched and won’t have the ability to service two years of repayments.”",585
22,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/a-century-on-whatever-happened-to-labours-firebrand-lost-leader,"“ Oh mad, foolish Grayson! ” Editorial in the socialist magazine The Clarion , August In the aftermath of the general election of February the mood in Marsden socialist club in west Yorkshire was grim. David Clark, the young Labour MP for Colne Valley, in which the former mill town of Marsden sits, had lost his seat. Clark gamely attempted to lift his activists’ spirits with a rousing speech. But one elderly stalwart remained unmoved: “Old Harry was sitting at the bar nursing a pint,” recalls Clark, who is now and a Labour peer. “He said: ‘All due respect to master Dave, but we’ve only ever had one true socialist MP around here. And that was Victor Grayson.’” Clark had heard this name many times before, always pronounced with a special reverence and a wistful sense of what might have been. With more time on his hands, he began to look into the story of the predecessor who inspired so much affection and emotion. What he discovered, and recorded in a recently updated biography, remains one of the most remarkable stories in the history of British politics and one of its biggest unsolved mysteries. For a brief period at the start of the last century, while still in his twenties, Victor Grayson became the most famous socialist in England and a potential Labour leader. Then, years ago this September, he vanished without trace. As Clark puts it: “One day in he walked out of his apartment accompanied by two men and was never conclusively seen again. What happened has fascinated me for half a century.” Precocious radicalism Grayson made his name in the Colne Valley by-election of At the age of fresh out of theological college in Manchester, he became the first avowedly socialist candidate to win a seat in parliament. It was a sensational victory. The Labour party, seven years old and led by Keir Hardie , had made its first major breakthroughs at the previous year general election. But this had been achieved through becoming, in effect, a junior partner to the Liberals, who stood aside in selected constituencies. Feeling their way, Labour first great leaders – Hardie, Philip Snowden and Ramsay MacDonald – were sticking to a mild programme of incremental reform to working conditions. Grayson precocious radicalism flamed across this horizon like a red comet. Colne Valley constituency , a mill-owners’ fiefdom, was a Liberal bastion that was believed to be unconquerable. Ignoring the reservations of the Labour leadership, Grayson took on the local political establishment, advocating revolutionary socialism and female suffrage. In his manifesto, he told the textile workers of the valley: “I do not believe that we are divinely destined to be drudges … the time for our emancipation has come.” Unbelievably, he won. The result was national news. On the evening of Grayson victory, a special correspondent for the Daily Express wrote: “The Red Flag waves over Colne Valley today. The fever of Socialism has infected thousands of workers.” But it was the manner and style of Grayson campaign, as much as his politics, that made him, in the words of one of his supporters, “the darling of the socialist movement”. Handsome, genial and eloquent, Grayson seemed to be blessed with every political gift. An Irish priest who followed Grayson campaign wrote: “Never have I seen people so moved; least of all these Yorkshire people, whose main interest I always thought to be ‘t’brass’ – never have I seen crowds so swept by the Holy Spirit.” The evangelical zeal was supplemented with quicksilver repartee and jokes: “Any great orator needs humour and warmth,” says Clark. “Much of Grayson style was about making people laugh. There was a famous occasion when he stopped halfway through a speech and said to the women in this working-class audience, ‘Ladies, what do you think of my hair today?’” At dizzying pace, such playfulness could give way to withering denunciations. Grayson could be funny or he could be excoriating, as when telling one Yorkshire rally: “We count it not only unjust, but undignified, for able-bodied persons to eat luxurious food [and] wear extravagant clothes, live in many and princely houses, all produced by others who grovel on the margin of existence.” ‘Traitors to your class’ According to Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP for Dagenham and Rainham, Grayson was a shining light in an almost forgotten Labour tradition. “He was a kind of political preacher,” says Cruddas. “He came from the pulpit tradition and embodied a radical humanism that staked everything on a moral critique of capitalism. There was nothing doctrinaire or pseudo-scientific about his socialism, in contrast to some of the Marxist currents around at the time. It was a battle about dignity and ethics. But, of course, it became very sad, what happened.” The sale of honours is a national scandal. It can be traced right down to Downing Street and to a monocled dandy I know Victor Grayson Grayson was an inspirational figure, but he was also flawed and vulnerable. An adopted child, there were persistent rumours that he was the illegitimate son of an aristocrat, which may have fuelled an insecurity that led to a growing alcohol problem. In London, he acquired a reputation for fine living which raised eyebrows in the non-conformist Pennines communities that had elected him. In parliament, he picked unwise fights with Labour colleagues. Six months after entering the House of Commons, Grayson was ordered from the chamber by the speaker after repeatedly disrupting a debate on temperance to talk about the plight of the unemployed. At the third time of asking he finally left, telling fellow Labour MPs: “I leave the House with pleasure. You are traitors to your class. You will not stand up for your class, you traitors.” It was the beginning of the end of a dazzling but short-lived parliamentary career. In the election of Grayson narrowly lost his seat in Colne Valley and his love of whisky was becoming a serious problem. He suffered nervous breakdowns. When, in he was found incapable of delivering a speech to a packed hall in Bradford, his loyal Yorkshire backers reluctantly cut their losses. As Clark writes in his biography: “A link which had lasted for ten years was severed – broken with regrets, for the Colne Valley activists had expected much, perhaps too much, from Victor Grayson. He had … given them their finest hour [but] the pressure was too great; his love of the good things of life proved too distracting. The whisky which had acted as his stimulant became his master.” The first world war led to a wider and more acrimonious parting of the ways with old allies. The vast majority of Grayson radical supporters within Labour were passionately anti-war, although the party itself was split. Grayson, who had railed against Prussian militarism, backed the conflict, in which he would fight and be wounded. He became a poster boy of the government recruitment campaign, addressing rallies throughout Britain, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. In newspapers, he wrote fulsome appreciations of the then first lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. An army medical report recorded that he was drinking a bottle of whisky a day while at the front. As support for the war drew him into new circles of influence, he was making dangerous but lucrative liaisons with such unlikely bedfellows as the newspaper proprietor, fraudster and populist patriot Horatio Bottomley. Beaten up on the Strand In the year he disappeared, Grayson was living in London, occupying an expensive suite of rooms in Piccadilly. Although he wrote occasional pieces of journalism, the income they generated would hardly have financed such lavish accommodation. Instead, Clark believes, after the war the former MP had turned to some form of blackmail. The natural generosity of spirit and joie de vivre had turned into something darker. “In political terms, he’d lost almost everything. He’d alienated the unions by calling their MPs traitors and he’d outraged the socialist left by backing the war. I think, when he came back, he must have calculated that the only way of maintaining his lifestyle was by exploiting the contacts he made with powerful establishment figures.” One of the regular visitors to Grayson apartment was a colourful and corrupt Whitehall fixer named Maundy Gregory. A peacock figure given to ostentatious displays of wealth, Gregory was said by a contemporary to habitually carry round “a wad of banknotes the size of a newly born baby head”. He had carved a postwar niche for himself illegally selling knighthoods, baronetcies and peerages on behalf of David Lloyd George government. In a public meeting of the time, Grayson summoned up some of the old fire: “The sale of honours,” he told his audience, “is a national scandal. It can be traced right down to Downing Street, and to a monocled dandy with offices in Whitehall. I know this man and one day I will name him.” But Grayson never carried out the threat. “He was probably being paid, on the authority of Lloyd George, to shut his mouth,” says Clark. In mid-September Grayson was beaten up in the Strand. Then, at the end of the month, the young manageress of his apartment block, Hilda Porter, saw Grayson leave accompanied by two men with whom he had been in discussions all afternoon. Porter later said his last words were: “I’ll be in touch soon.” Was he murdered? For decades, that was the common assumption. But Clark now believes that Grayson was paid off for good and told to adopt a new identity. “Remember there was no television. It was possible even for well-known people to go unrecognised in a way that couldn’t happen now. I think, in Victor had tired of his superstar status. He had been terribly affected by the recent death of his wife, Ruth. Lloyd George may have got fed up paying him and Grayson was presented with an offer he couldn’t refuse.” The theory is supported by an intriguing piece of testimony from a former Colne Valley comrade. In the a veteran of the famous by-election of claimed to have tracked Grayson down to a furniture shop in London, which he said he owned. Ernest Marklew had himself become the Colne Valley MP in Shortly before his death, he told a Labour colleague that, after Grayson confirmed his identity, he begged Marklew to say nothing, as he had left public life. The exact details of the encounter, Clark thinks, were changed to protect him. Clark originally called his book about Grayson Labour Lost Leader . But, in truth, he says, the mercurial hero of Colne Valley would not have been right for that role. “The Labour party had opted against the revolutionary road to socialism and they were working at what they had to do – become an official opposition and start to appeal to people who hadn’t made the jump to socialist thinking. Gifted as he was, Grayson would not have had the temperament to deal with that.” But there can be no doubt that, in the unforgiving hills of the Pennines, he achieved something remarkable. Cruddas believes there are lessons to learn from Grayson astonishing ability to connect. “The modern left is in danger, at times, of looking soulless,” he says. “A mixture of doctrinaire edicts and liberal neutrality. The early Grayson came from a different, warmer tradition. His kind of radical humanism is exactly what the left needs today.” Soon after the triumph of when Grayson was still at the height of his powers, a fellow socialist tried to capture the impact he was making. “The children in the Colne Valley learn to pronounce his name,” wrote Wilfred Thompson in an early biography, “almost before they begin to say ‘Father’. Some are christened after him . It is a very common thing to see them sitting upon the edge of the platform at his meetings, almost before they can walk. Every Colne Valley child knows ‘Vitter Gayson’.” The memories were to remain long after the man had gone.",2008
23,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/rosena-allin-khan-if-matt-hancock-found-it-difficult-that-is-on-him,"When Rosena Allin-Khan stood up in the House of Commons last Tuesday to address the health secretary, Matt Hancock , she anticipated being stonewalled. She didn’t expect to become the story. In her other life, the MP for Tooting is an A&amp;E doctor and intensive care specialist and has been working hospital shifts throughout the pandemic. Allin-Khan reported that the government failures were contributing to a greater loss of life and she wanted answers on its testing strategy. The health secretary awkwardly responded by suggesting that Allin-Khan testimony was untrue and moreover, that she “might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary of state book in terms of tone”. “Watch your tone!” Allin-Khan exhales, still in mild disbelief. “I have written to the government several times since March, asking why we haven’t followed WHO guidelines, asking for clearer messaging on social distancing, urging for more PPE. I’ve had no response. I was bringing messages from the frontline,” she says over the phone from her home in south London. The exchange went viral after she tweeted it , morphing into a meme online then as a talking point on Good Morning Britain, Sky News, BBC News, LBC and beyond. Being patronised by Hancock was one thing, but to be dismissed so audaciously on the day the UK reported the highest death toll in Europe galls her. “I was very courteous in my delivery. If Matt Hancock found it difficult, that on him. Addressing the fact that lives could have been saved and families’ hearts might not have been broken had we got on top of testing earlier? These are legitimate questions that people all across the country have. I was very polite. He didn’t like the content, so instead felt it easier to make a derogatory comment towards me.” Allin-Khan says she is used to confounding people. Her mother is Polish and her father is Pakistani and she grew up in a poor household in the constituency she now represents as “a proud British Muslim”. She describes her upbringing as “difficult … turbulent”. She won’t elaborate out of sensitivity towards her parents, except to say it meant “I failed my A-levels spectacularly”. Nonetheless, at Allin-Khan ended up reading medicine at Cambridge and gained a masters in public health before working as a doctor in disaster zones across the world. “People are still confused by who I am or what I am,” she says, of the layers of ignorance she has navigated her whole life. “The biggest learning journey I have had as a politician is seeing how much I can be hated for being eastern European, for being Pakistani, for being Muslim. I never came from a political background. The vitriol shocked me.” At alongside her constituency work, Allin-Khan serves as a shadow cabinet minister for mental health and is an amateur boxer, wife, and mother to two children under six. She stopped her campaign for Labour deputy leadership in March and then went to work treating patients at St George hospital in south London and at the newly opened Nightingale. The experience has been harrowing and frightening. “Families are begging me for a miracle I can’t give them. You’re unable to console them with a hug or a touch on the shoulder. You have to watch their hearts break, you’re the one delivering goodbye messages to their loved ones,” Allin-Khan takes a pause. “Messages like ‘please hold on, Dad’, ‘please hold on for the kids’ – it puts chills through your body but you have to hold it together and stay strong for these families. It is very hard to do.” At home, her children have been taught not to run to her until she has stripped her clothes into the washing machine and showered. She uses separate cutlery, crockery and towels from her family and has found herself in tears “wondering about how many of all those deaths could have been avoided”. She has found the clapping for key workers “a wonderful way for communities to feel they are supporting frontline staff. It an opportunity to say thank you”. But she is scornful that it is “a pointless exercise if government ministers clap, but don’t provide resources the NHS needs”. Allin-Khan became a Labour councillor during her first maternity leave in winning “in a local ward that had been Conservative for years”. Two years later, just after the birth of her second child, Sadiq Khan left his Tooting seat to become mayor of London and Allin-Khan was encouraged to stand. There were candidates up for selection and she found the campaign gruelling; the Daily Mail published old photos of her in a bikini, claiming that the working-class doctor had in fact been a secret swimwear model with “a glamorous past”. At the time, she was distraught. “That people would be out there trying to tarnish my character over something that wasn’t true and deliberately using my ethnicity and religion to try and humiliate me was upsetting. It can be all-consuming.” But she says she kept on “because I have a work ethic that means that once I commit to doing something, I give I can use my platform to be a voice for the voiceless Allin-Khan was elected the day MP Jo Cox was murdered in “It was horrific,” she says flatly, at the time unsure of what she had got herself into. Allin-Khan claims not to have any political heroes – “mine are more everyday heroes” – but says she became more interested in politics at university. “The Labour party did change my life and gave me opportunities that wouldn’t have happened under the status quo,” she says. “It wouldn’t have been possible for someone with a background like mine to have gone to medical school otherwise.” Witnessing the erosion of the health service firsthand has been a prime motivator for her political energy. “I am so grateful to be doing the work I always did, but now I have MP after my name and suddenly people are interested. I can use my platform to be a voice for the voiceless.” It is indisputable to Allin-Khan that coronavirus has escalated a system already in crisis. “Uncertainty breeds anxiety. Labour wants to support the government to get this right. Our priority is protecting public health, but we do need a consensus on what happens next.” Is there a sense that criticism has been tempered in the Commons chamber for the sake of fostering national unity? “Nobody likes political point-scoring, but it is a challenge not to be able to scrutinise decisions that affect the whole country. Things like Boris Johnson announcing a press conference on Sunday to decide the future of the country? That sort of announcement should be made in parliament where there can be due diligence and scrutiny.” The Public Health England review into why so many BAME people are dying disproportionately from fills her with similar frustration. “I have reservations about the review and how it will be conducted.” Referring to the controversial appointment to the review of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission who has been suspended from the Labour party over allegations of Islamophobia, she says: “We need to have trust in this review. Our BAME communities deserve it.” Allin-Khan says she was underestimated at the beginning of her political career, but that it only fuelled her to keep going. “I’m an ordinary woman living an extraordinary life, and I am driven very much by what is right and what is wrong,” she says. “If I lose my seat tomorrow, I will have been grateful to have represented my community and saved as many lives as I could. That why when Matt Hancock said what he said, I just thought no. No, I won’t watch my tone – I’ve got something I need to say.” This article was amended on May because an earlier version said that Allin-Khan “dropped out of Labour deputy leadership campaign in March”. To clarify: she stopped campaigning in order to work hospital shifts but she stayed in the race.",1350
24,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-live-contact-tracing-app-trial-begins-on-isle-of-wight,"The UK coronavirus death toll rose above to the highest in Europe. ONS figures and calculations by Reuters revealed that deaths were registered with on the death certificate . However, as the official tally reached the government rejected international comparisons due to all-cause excess mortality as well as differences in how individual countries collect and measure their data. Dominic Raab told the daily press briefing: I don’t think you can make the international comparisons you’re suggesting at this stage, at least I don’t think you can make them reliably. The UK testing capacity should have been expanded sooner , Sir Patrick Vallance told the health committee. However he said Dr Jenny Harries had been right to say testing on its own does not provide the solution. He said: In the early phases, if we had managed to ramp testing capacity quicker, it would have been beneficial. For all sorts of reasons that did not happen. And I think it clear you need lots of testing for this. Reopening all schools at once would create a “very real risk” of an increase in the infection rate and of a second peak, the government said . Raab said the evidence to date suggested the five tests and risk of a second spike were crucial to deciding how and when to reopen schools, and Sage is considering different options for how to do this safely. This came on the same day the Scottish government published a paper outlining that it would not be safe for schools to reopen fully in the foreseeable future. An extract said: Full reopening [of schools] would cause a resurgence in the virus such that hospital capacity in Scotland would be overwhelmed in less than two months ... We are considering a phased approach to returning pupils to school, when it is safe to do so. We do not consider it likely that schools will reopen fully in the foreseeable future. Indeed, we are not yet certain that they can re-open at all in the near future. Virgin Atlantic announced plans to cut jobs and end its operation of Gatwick. The airline said uncertainty over when flying will resume as well as “unprecedented market conditions” as a result of the pandemic had “severely reduced revenues”, leaving it to reduce its workforce by more than a third. That it from us for today on the UK side. Thank you to everyone who got in touch with a story and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Coronavirus live news: WHO urges countries to investigate suspicious early cases after French find Updated at BST As the UK official death toll from passed Italy for the first time, it is worth noting that one month ago, government sources were privately sceptical of a study by world-leading disease data analysts that projected the UK would be the worst-affected country in Europe. The study anticipated deaths by August. The total figure on Tuesday, which is certain to be an underestimate, was already more than With Britain relative position appearing to worsen, the government attempt to shape the narrative at its daily Downing Street press briefing has become more important – and the slideshow of charts presented by advisers have been at the heart of the story. The slides have become a recognisable feature of the discussion but there has been little scrutiny of the data behind them – and how it can mislead rather than enlighten. Read the full analysis by Pamela Duncan and Niamh McIntyre here: Why No death toll slides don't tell the whole story Updated at BST Dominic press conference - Summary Andrew Sparrow Here are the main points from Dominic Raab press conference. Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, claimed it was too early to say that the UK has the worst record for coronavirus deaths in Europe. He was speaking after he said that the official death toll for coronavirus deaths in the UK is now This covers all people who have died and tested positive for coronavirus. It does not include people who will have died from coronavirus without a test being carried out. As this chart from the respected Worldometer website shows, today total means the headline UK figure has overtaken Italy and is now the highest in Europe. But when it was put to Raab that the UK now has the worst record in Europe, he did not accept that. He replied: In terms of the comparison you’re suggesting ... I don’t think we’ll get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over and particularly until we’ve got comprehensive international data on all cause of mortality. Raab also suggested that one reason why the UK might be looking so bad was because of the efficiency of the Office for National Statistics. He said: We now publish data that includes all deaths in all settings and not all countries do that so I’m not sure that the international comparison works unless you reliably know that all countries are measuring in the same way. And it also depends on how good frankly, countries are at gathering their statistics, and our own Office for National Statistics is widely acknowledged as a world leader. I don’t think you can make the international comparisons you’re suggesting at this stage, at least I don’t think you can make them reliably. Raab said it would not be safe to re-open all schools in England. He said: At least to date the evidence has been that we wouldn’t be able to open up all schools without a very real risk that the R rate - the transmission rate - would rise at such a level that we would risk a second spike. He was speaking in response to a question about whether the UK government agreed with the assessment of the Scottish government, which in a paper published today (pdf) said schools in Scotland could not fully re-open for the foreseeable future. The Scottish document said: Full re-opening [of schools] would cause a resurgence in the virus such that hospital capacity in Scotland would be overwhelmed in less than two months ... We are considering a phased approach to returning pupils to school, when it is safe to do so. We do not consider it likely that schools will reopen fully in the foreseeable future. Indeed, we are not yet certain that they can re-open at all in the near future. Raab said cyber criminals, aided by hostile states, were trying to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis. He said: We have clear evidence now that these criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations which are responding to the pandemic which I have to say makes them particularly dangerous and venal at this time. Our teams have identified campaigns targeting healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organisations and various different arms of local government. There are various objectives and motivations that lie behind these attacks from fraud on one hand to espionage but they tend to be designed to steal bulk personal data, intellectual property and wider information that supports those aims and they’re with other state actors. He confirmed that, for the third day in a row, the number of coronavirus tests carried out fell below the target set for the end of April. He said tests were carried out on Monday. He said ministers are looking at sports being played behind closed doors in the second phase of the coronavirus response. Asked about the Premier League possibly returning in mid-June, he replied: I think it would lift the spirits of the nation. I think people would like to see us get back not just to work and get to a stage where children can safely return to school, but also enjoy some of those pastimes, sporting in particular. I know that the government has had constructive meetings with sports bodies to plan for athletes to resume training when it safe to do so. I can tell you that the culture secretary [Oliver Dowden] has also been working on a plan to get sports played behind closed doors when we move to the second phase, that something I can tell you we’re looking at. Whether it a combination of test, tracking, tracing and other social distancing measures within what possible within a sporting environment we want to see whether behind closed doors what the options are for doing that. Jamie Grierson The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus among prisoners and staff continues to rise, the latest Ministry of Justice data shows. As at on Monday, prisoners had tested positive for the virus across prisons, an increase of in hours, while infected staff rose by to workers in prisons in the same period. The figures include those who have recovered. A total of prisoners and six prison staff are known to have contracted and died. There are prisoners in England and Wales and around staff in public-sector prisons. Doctors in Birmingham have launched an urgent investigation into how and why is disproportionately affecting black, Asian and minority ethnic people, our colleague Haroon Siddique reports. Last month the government announced a similar nationwide inquiry but details remain sparse and the selection of some of those chosen to assist has proved controversial. Meanwhile, doctors at University hospitals Birmingham NHS trust are pressing ahead with their own review. Dr Adnan Sharif, a consultant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth hospital, said: Birmingham is a single local authority, over a million people on its books with a large, BAME community which has been impacted by Covid a lot, so it would be the best place to try and do this. Figures from another trust in the region show of coronavirus deaths at Birmingham city hospital in March were from BAME communities , although it fell last month to University hospitals Birmingham NHS trust, one of the biggest teaching trusts in the country, has recorded the highest number of deaths of any trust. The full story is here . Doctors in Birmingham begin probe into BAME deaths from Gove floats prospect of UK conceding need for some tariffs in UK-EU trade deal Lisa Michael Gove has hinted that the UK would be prepared to abandon its goal of getting a zero-tariff, zero-quotas trade deal with the EU if it did not relent on its demand for a level playing field. Speaking to the House of Lords EU committee, the Cabinet Office minister said it might be a way of showing the EU how serious the UK was. He explained: It is a ‘for instance’ of an area where we would say, okay, we’re prepared to modify our ‘ask’ because of the importance that we maintain over regulatory autonomy. It may be that the EU doesn’t resolve that in ways that would be helpful, but it is one of the ways in which we would be prepared to show leg. The EU wants the UK to commit to a level playing field in workers’ rights, environmental protections and state aid so that it doesn’t have a “Singapore-type” competitor on its door step. Gove floated the idea of the UK accepting the case for a trade deal involving some tariffs as a solution. He said: Were it the case that the EU were to say, ‘you know what, we don’t think we can give you that unless you sign up to all our level playing field arrangements’, so we said ‘OK, we’re not signing up for those LPF arrangements, we will have non-regression clauses and agreements, so you can be sure about our standards’. But, if it is the case that we ended up like CETA [the EU-Canada trade deal] with tariffs on a small number of goods, we will regret that, we will think it is a missed opportunity, but if that is the price that we have to pay, then, there we go. Updated at BST Here is a clip of the moment Matt Hancock , the health secretary, criticised the ‘tone’ of Labour shadow minister and A&amp;E doctor Rosena Allin- Khan after she said the government lack of testing had cost lives. She also said the figures were being manipulated to achieve a goal of tests a day. Dr Allin-Khan later tweeted: The press conference is now over. Q: [From the Western Mail in Wales] These press conferences can be confusing for people in Wales, because some measures are UK-wide and some are England-only. Will you be clearer about this? Raab says the advice has been “remarkably consistent” across all four UK nations. Raab says it would be good to get sports events happening again. But this can only happen when the medical and scientific advice says it can be done safely. Q: If sports are behind closed doors, will that apply until a vaccine is found? Raab says he cannot look too far into the future because a vaccine is just one way of controlling the disease. Therapeutics (medicines) are another. Test, track and trace might be an answer too, he says. Raab says it would not be safe to reopen all schools Q: What are the prospects of schools opening in England? Raab says he feels for parents dealing with home schooling, and for teachers. He says the five tests are crucial. The government wants to avoid a second spike. He says Sage is looking at different options. But they could not open all schools without a real risk of R going above he says. Raab says it would not be safe to reopen all schools. Q: What do we know about obesity as a risk factor? Should people diet? McLean says obesity does seem to make you more at risk. It is best not to be obese, she says. But she says that there are better ways to control your weight than dieting. Updated at BST Q: The Scottish government said today if schools went back in Scotland , hospitals could become overwhelmed, by as much as seven times. Does that apply to England? McLean says it is hard to monitor children, because they tend to have very mild symptoms if they get it. Q: Is it the right time to do Brexit talks? Or are there benefits from doing it now? Raab says both sides will want to avoid uncertainty. We are making good progress, he says. Or progress, he says, correcting himself. But he says it is important to avoid future uncertainty. To do that, the UK and the EU should strike a trade deal. Both sides could then bounce back. Prolonging the uncertainty would make things worse, he says. Q: Why is the end-of-year deadline so important? The country wants certainty, Raab says. Updated at BST Q: When the test, track and trace system is in place, do you think the death rate will come closer to the European average? Raab says the UK has been able to flatten the peak because of public cooperation with the lockdown. He says test, track and trace should give the government the ability to move to the second phase. McLean says the global death comparison chart shows cumulative deaths. So the numbers won’t go down. They can only go flat. And the UK will only match other countries if they catch up, McLean says. But she says she would not wish that on anyone. Raab says it is too early to say UK has worst coronavirus death record in Europe Q: It is looking as if the UK now has the highest death toll in Europe.

25,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/05/matt-hancocks-career-continues-to-win-the-battle-with-his-conscience,"ormally Matt Hancock is relentlessly upbeat. The very model of middle-management enthusiasm. The Tigger who gives good meeting and likes to say yes. But over the past week or so, a few cracks have begun to appear in his natural charm and the health secretary has been decidedly tetchy. It as if he feels under-appreciated. Not just by a country that he feels he has been working round the clock – no one has done more media appearances than him – to single-handedly save from the coronavirus pandemic, and which only wants to know why the UK now has the highest number of deaths in Europe , but by his cabinet colleagues who are, at best, doing nothing and frequently making things actively worse. If he never saw Priti Patel or Michael Gove again it wouldn’t be a moment too soon. Here he actually has the nation sympathy. If that wasn’t bad enough, on the very morning before he was due to face both departmental questions and an urgent question in the Commons, he’d rather been landed in the shit by both the chief and deputy scientific advisers giving evidence at the select committee. Patrick Vallance had said that if it was down to him then all the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies’ evidence would have been published – something the government needed like a hole in the head – while Jenny Harries had all but admitted that the reason the UK had not made testing a priority early on was because we did not have the capacity to do so. So Matt was already on a decidedly short fuse as he took his place on the government front bench. He made it through questions from the shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, by interpreting them as unequivocal support for his new “test, track and trace” app that was being piloted on the Isle of Wight , but lost it when challenged by Labour junior health minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, who in her spare time as an MP doubles up as an A&amp;E doctor in a south London hospital and has far more experience of how the NHS works in practice than Hancock. Not that Allin-Khan questions were particularly aggressive or demanding. Rather, they were completely to the point. The testing strategy had been non-existent early on and the figures had been manipulated to allow the health secretary to claim that his arbitrary target of daily tests had been reached by the end of April. All of which had contributed to an unnecessarily high mortality rate and had meant that doctors like her had been left to break the bad news that people had died to relatives. This was too much for Tigger. Almost as if a nerve had been touched. “Methought I heard a voice cry. Sleep no more! Mattbeth doth murder sleep.” For deep down Hancock does care: he knows that the government response to the pandemic in the early days was hopelessly inadequate and that many lives could have possibly been saved. Yet he dare not say so for fear of implicating both himself and colleagues. In the battle between his career and his conscience, the career is still winning. But the gap is closing. Part of him longs to tell the truth. About the uselessness of his predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who ran down the capacity of the NHS to unsafe levels. About the self-indulgence of a prime minister who prioritised celebrating Brexit and sorting out his private life over trying to make sure the country was prepared for the pandemic. Yet he can’t quite go there yet. So instead he attacked Allin-Khan for adopting the wrong tone. In time, he will see that it was he who got the tone wrong. During a brief interlude while Hancock left the chamber, his junior minister, the nice-but-dim Edward Argar, claimed the reason the UK had failed to join the EU procurement scheme four times was because the email had gone to the wrong address four times, but that if an invitation went to the right address next time he would be all ears. He then compounded the embarrassment by insisting Exercise Cygnus had been a total success in preparing the country for the pandemic, because it had turned out we had enough ventilators all along despite his department having tried to panic-buy in March. It come to something when a minister can’t come up with any better excuses than this. Even when he returned for the UQ, Hancock didn’t seem entirely himself. He just couldn’t understand why everyone was so focused on what was going wrong. The lack of personal protective equipment, the high mortality rate, the reluctance of the government to announce any relaxation of lockdown to parliament rather than at a bank holiday press conference. Why couldn’t people congratulate him on reaching his testing target? One day he will realise he’d have got more applause for narrowly failing to meet an ambitious target, than fiddling the figures? There again, Matt isn’t the fastest of learners. So maybe not. There were times when you could sense Hancock was itching to dob his colleagues in. Jeremy Hunt for ignoring Exercise Cygnus. Priti Vacant for failing to test and isolate passengers at airports. But he held it together. Just. Though for how much longer is anyone guess. Right now he propping up the entire government and taking the flak for everyone else failures. Sooner or later, something will have to give. And when Matt does erupt, it could be a thing of beauty. It could also be the making of him. The Little Man revenge.",934
26,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/raab-praise-of-uae-concerning-says-matthew-hedges,"Matthew Hedges, the UK citizen held for seven months by the United Arab Emirates, has accused the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, of being tone deaf after he described the Gulf state as a “true friend and valued partner of the UK”. The foreign secretary made the remark after the UAE donated medical equipment to the UK, but Hedges said it was an example of how authoritarian countries use donations to garner diplomatic respectability. Hedges, a PhD student at the University of Durham, was detained on a false charge of espionage and held in solitary confinement for seven months by the UAE. In a letter to the Guardian, he said he he found Raab remarks very difficult to swallow considering how little the Foreign Office had done to secure his release. The UAE is no true friend, Mr Raab | Letter He added: “It is further concerning that despite the UAE being clearly in opposition to the UK goals in the conflicts in Libya and Yemen, the foreign secretary thinks that the UAE are valued partners who share the same diplomatic interests. “It seems that not only does the UK government not value British lives abroad, it is happy to ignore terrible human rights abuses by regimes like the UAE, in order to deflect from their own failings during a global pandemic. “Perhaps the foreign secretary should push for arbitrarily detained British citizens to be released in the UAE and for a de-escalation in Libya and Yemen before choosing to thank the UAE so thoughtlessly.’” Hedges was arrested in May and charged with spying on behalf of the British government. In November he was sentenced to life imprisonment. After a political outcry in the UK, prompted by his wife, he was pardoned by the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The Foreign Office had advised Hedges’ family not to publicise his arrest, but instead rely on private diplomacy. Hedges has two outstanding complaints with the Foreign Office – one to the parliamentary ombudsman on how the Foreign Office failed in his view to come to his defence until his case was publicised, and a second with the information commissioner on how the Foreign Office has heavily redacted all the documents he requested under the Freedom of Information Act concerning the Foreign Office internal response to his arrest. The UAE is seen as one of the UK government most valued partners in the middle east, but its increasingly active foreign policy has conflicted with the British stance in Libya. There, UAE groups in suspected breach of a United Nations arms embargo, have been aiding General Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the Libyan National Army, which has been seeking violently to usurp the UN recognised government in Tripoli. The UAE regards itself as a bulwark against the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East. The Foreign Office said in a statement: “The UK has a strong history of protecting human rights and promoting our values globally. We continue to encourage the UAE to uphold international human rights obligations and promote regional stability. “FCO staff and ministers worked incredibly hard on Matthew case and were delighted he was able to return to the UK.”",530
27,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/12/boris-johnson-accused-misleading-mps-coronavirus-stay-alert-slogan,"Boris Johnson has been accused of misleading parliament by suggesting that his top medical and scientific advisers signed off his government new “stay alert” slogan. The acting Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey , claims the prime minister misled MPs “inadvertently or otherwise” by telling them in a debate in the Commons on Monday that reports that they had not approved the message were “not right”. Davey has asked Johnson to come back to the chamber to “clear up this discrepancy” and ensure that Hansard, the official record of parliamentary proceedings, is clarified so that it is accurate. Davey has written to Johnson about his response to the Guardian report on Monday that neither Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, nor Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, had approved the “stay alert” message. Political leaders, scientists and doctors have criticised it as vague and confusing and warned that it could lead to the erosion of public compliance with the lockdown rules. The experts appeared to undermine Johnson denial when asked about the report by the BBC political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, when they appeared alongside him at a press conference on Monday evening. In the debate about the government new plan to ease the lockdown Davey said: “Throughout this crisis, many of us have put party politics aside to support the national effort to defeat coronavirus and we want to keep doing that, not least because the British people have sacrificed so much already, but in return, the government must be clear with the British people and reassure us that ministers are following the science and the advice of independent experts. “So will the prime minister confirm new reports that neither the chief medical officer nor the chief scientific adviser signed off yesterday shift in the public health message from ‘stay at home’ to ‘stay alert’?” In reply Johnson said: “That is not right”. In his letter Davey told Johnson he was “extremely concerned” that his denial appeared to be at odds with what Whitty and Vallance said to Kuenssberg. He reminded the prime minister he had inquired about the “scientific and evidential basis for the change in messaging” when Johnson briefed opposition party leaders by telephone on Sunday, ahead of his televised address that night in which he set out the first steps towards easing the lockdown. In his letter, Davey said: “It is also why when, having read press reports that the change in public health messaging had not been signed off by either the chief medical officer or the chief scientific officer, that during your statement to the house on Monday I asked you directly about that. In response you refuted these suggestions and stated that those reports were ‘not right’. “I was therefore extremely concerned to watch at the press conference just hours later both the chief medical officer or the chief scientific officer refuse to confirm they had directly signed off on the new message of ‘stay alert’ – seemingly in direct contradiction to your answer to me.” Challenging Johnson to set the record straight, he added: “I think we can both agree that if you have misled parliament, inadvertently or otherwise, that this is incredibly serious. I write to you in the hope that not only can you clear up this discrepancy, but that you attend the house to correct the record at your earliest convenience.” The Guardian approached Downing Street to seek the prime minister response to Davey. Asked on Monday about Whitty and Vallance role in the change from “stay at home” to “stay alert”, a government spokesperson, referring to the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage), said: “Sage advice fed into the new strategy as it has throughout the response.”",621
28,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/18/layla-moran-criticises-lib-dems-general-election-strategy,"Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP competing to become the party next leader, has castigated its tactics at the last election, saying a pledge to revoke Brexit lost it the trust of voters, while Jo Swinson talk of becoming prime minister was not seen as credible. Moran said the Lib Dem national image was “broken” and the party had to reconnect with voters and examine what it stood for after Brexit, or else risk “bumping along with support and or MPs for a number of years”. The Oxford West and Abingdon MP also said that whoever becomes the new Labour leader must end the “very tribal politics” between the parties and cooperate to the extent of electoral pacts. “I think we’re quite a way off from that right now,” said Moran, the party education spokeswoman, who announced her candidacy just over a week ago. “Nevertheless, I do think that Labour need to look themselves in the eye and decide if they want to win or not.” Her most pointed comment concerned the Lib Dems’ hugely disappointing election campaign, during which the then leader, Swinson, initially presented herself as a prime minister-in-waiting , only to lose her seat as the party slipped to MPs. Moran – who stresses she takes her share of responsibility for the decisions – said the ambitious stance was initially justified, but should have been changed after the Brexit party stood down the bulk of its candidates in favour of the Conservatives. “Then, under the first past the post system it actually became not just unlikely, but frankly impossible that we were going to form a government, and that lost us credibility,” she said. Moran, who is travelling the country talking to Lib Dem activists and to voters about what went wrong, also criticised the leadership shift ahead of the party conference last autumn to a policy of revoking Brexit without a second referendum, albeit only in the unlikely situation of winning an absolute majority. There was at the time, she said, “a fear that Labour was going to roll its tanks on to our turf and we needed something to be distinctive”. But, she argued, the idea was pushed through the party without proper debate. “I’ve been talking to activists who say, yes, they were bounced into it, partly because the decision was made in rooms in Westminster with not enough dissenting voices before,” Moran said. “So by the time it went to conference, it felt like it was a confidence motion.” While the Lib Dems pride themselves on being a grassroots-led party, Moran said this was being lost: “I’m concerned, if you look at the parliamentary party makeup at the moment, we are going to be perceived as a party of the elite of London and the south-east. “And that absolutely is not what I want for our party, we need to be a party for the entire country. And so, yes, we absolutely need to change the way we make policy.” The two biggest obstacles the party faced in December election, Moran said, remained the electoral system and potential voters’ distaste for Jeremy Corbyn. “But that doesn’t absolve us from our own responsibility for decisions that we took,” she said. Moran refused to say which of the three candidates to succeed Corbyn she would most like to work with, but said that whoever did take over would need to not just cooperate better with other parties and embrace electoral change. “They need to appreciate that unless they work with us to change the electoral system it possible that the Conservatives, particularly with the lack of strength of Labour in Scotland, are going to have a majority forever,” she said. “They need to get quite pragmatic about that, in my view.” The only other candidate to formally announce they are running for the Lib Dem leadership so far is Wera Hobhouse, the MP for Bath, although Ed Davey, who took over as interim leader after Swinson lost her seat, seems certain to do so as well. Daisy Cooper, who won St Albans for the party in December, is also considering joining the race. Nominations do not open until May , with voting among members not completed before mid-July. Moran said a key issue was developing new policy priorities, saying she had asked voters what they knew about the Lib Dems: “Unfortunately, for many of them, the answer is nothing. With Brexit, they knew what we were against. But when you ask them, well, what are we for, they don’t have an answer.” Her three priorities would be to boost equality of opportunity via education, tackle the climate emergency, and work towards more collaborative politics. The Lib Dems, she said, still had a strong local base, with popular councillors. “It the national brand that broken. And in my view, that what needs to change.”",808
29,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/02/a-labour-lib-dem-pact-and-the-need-for-reform,"Bravo to Polly Toynbee for her continued efforts in flying the flag for electoral reform ( A pact with the Lib Dems may be the only way Labour can win , February). She is right to highlight most of the voting public supporting a system of proportional representation. The main obstacle is the politicians elected under the current system, who put their own interest first. The Tories throw the word democracy around when it suits them, but will never change a system that gives them a free rein on a minority of the vote. Unfortunately, in recent years, it seems that Labour would rather its own members voted tactically for the Lib Dems than commit to a system that negates the need for this. Keir Starmer has made some encouraging comments on PR, and appears to be more open to reform than any Labour leadership candidate for decades. Rebecca Long-Bailey is also open to PR. Lisa Nandy is more enthusiastic about progressive alliances, which would be unnecessary under a new system. However, all three leadership candidates find it an easier win to talk up abolition of the House of Lords, which is already party policy. All three also have safe seats, but would do well to remember those Labour voters in safe Tory seats, currently unrepresented. Theo Morgan Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform I share Polly Toynbee enthusiasm for a tactical alliance between Labour and the Liberal Democrats to obtain a majority in order to drive through electoral reform as one route to unblocking our malfunctioning politics. However, her suggestion that pure proportional representation is the solution is less convincing. Some of our near neighbours use different systems that offer attractive features, not least the French two-round voting and the Irish multi-party constituencies. Rather than guessing the answer, and rushing into another poorly designed constitutional referendum, a Labour-led coalition in should first convoke a citizens’ assembly to study the options in depth and recommend how and why our electoral system could be reformed. Jan Kamieniecki London May I remind Polly Toynbee, who says Lib Dems stay unforgiven by Labour voters for coalition austerity, that Blairite Labour stays unforgiven by many Lib Dems for the Iraq war? As someone who can see both sides, who has been a member of both parties, I’m relieved that no one in the Labour leadership election was involved, although it would have ruled out Yvette Cooper, for instance, who is frequently cited as someone who should have stood. Labour has tried hard to remind young voters of the Lib Dem U-turn on student fees. Canvassing for the Lib Dems in a traditionally Labour area of Winchester last December, I found that the traditional Labour voters were largely not interested, but the council houses that had been privatised through right-to-buy and are now student housing were now occupied by interested young people who were keen to vote Lib Dem. Analyse that if you can. In the end the Lib Dem candidate knocked off the Tory majority, which, although a magnificent effort, was sadly not enough. If Labour had not fielded a candidate, we would not now have a Tory MP. Judith Martin Winchester, Hampshire Much as I agree with Polly Toynbee on the potential benefits of a pact between Labour and the Liberal Democrats at the next general election, she seems to have overlooked the need for the SNP and Plaid Cymru to be involved too, for the figures to add up. Perhaps she could explain how such a wide pact might work? Nigel Lindsay Bo’ness, West Lothian Polly Toynbee unfortunately underestimates the challenge Labour faces in the next election when she refers to the need “to beat a majority of That is the government overall majority.

Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, told ITV that when she was pregnant a colleague had expressed surprise to be told Siddiq was having a daughter, as she thought people from Asian backgrounds were likely to abort girls. Siddiq said: “Speaking to a colleague of a mine, she looked at me in astonishment and said: ‘You know you’re having a girl, because normally they don’t tell people of Asian origin they’re having a girl because you know, then Asian people decide …’ And I looked at her and I couldn’t believe what she was saying.” Siddiq added that when she was first running for parliament someone advised her to use her husband surname, because “people wouldn’t vote for ‘Tulip Siddiq’”. Comments from MPs who asked to remain anonymous included one who said they had been spat at in the street because of their religion. Other said they had experienced racist comments while campaigning, as well as racist letters and emails.

Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion since insisted she has done nothing wrong, but said she cannot comment further as investigations by the parliamentary commissioner for standards are confidential. News of the investigation came after a former Ukip candidate made a complaint about a pre-election fundraiser in which Lucas team raised nearly by offering rewards in exchange for donations, such as a cake baked by the MP if you gave Another item was the chance for one person to received a “personal guided tour of House of Commons” if Lucas was re-elected, in return for a donation of According to the code of conduct and related rules of the house, a document given to all MPs, members “must not offer tours of the house or of the Elizabeth Tower or Big Ben in raffles or auctions”.

In May election he faces a challenge from Tory candidate Shaun Bailey, former Conservative cabinet member Rory Stewart – who is standing as an independent – as well as candidates from the Green party , the Liberal Democrats and the Women Equality party. But announcing the new fund, which officials said comes from higher council tax and business rates, Khan insisted May election was a “two horse race” between him and Bailey – and made a direct pitch for green votes. “The Tory candidate and I are the only candidates who can win this election,” he said. “Which is why I’m making a direct appeal today to Londoners who have previously supported the Green party to lend me their vote on May so that I can stand up for our shared values and take action on climate change.” The mayor has introduced an ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) in central London which is due to expand to the north and south circulars in However, other cities – including Manchester and Birmingham – have announced ambitious plans to improve air quality and encourage cycling, and Khan has been criticised for not moving quickly enough. But the mayor insisted he was determined to make London a leading green city. “These issues are personal to me. I don’t want my children to grow up in a world where our very way of life is threatened by the climate crisis. And as someone who suffers from adult onset asthma, I understand the price we pay for failing to clean up our toxic air.” Green groups welcomed the new fund but said Khan must go further if he is re-elected in May. Jenny Bates, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the climate and nature crisis was the biggest threat the world faced, adding air pollution in London was “a health scandal”. “While the mayor has made good strides on these issues, much more needs to be done to cut emissions from all sectors. This means expanding the Ulez to the whole of London, not just to the north and south circular roads. We also need more infrastructure to make cycling and walking safer and easier for everyone, along with clear action to cut traffic levels which a London-wide pay-as-you-go driving system would help deliver.” Bates also criticised the mayor for approving the four-lane Silvertown road tunnel in east London which she said would make “already illegally bad air breathed in some areas even worse”. “There is no place for large scale road-building in London given the climate and air pollution imperatives, nor for any airport expansion at City airport or Heathrow.” Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, said it was right that all candidates for London mayor prioritised the climate emergency. “We will see what all parties have to offer but this is a helpful pledge to increase the priority that climate protection receives in a city of global significance such as London,” he added.

The Norwich South MP is pitching himself as the candidate to tackle what he calls the “crisis of democracy”. “If the rules of the system are rigged, don’t fight by them,” he said. “So let talk about having a constitutional convention, let talk about PR [proportional representation], let talk about reform of the Lords. Let talk about devolving, and moving power-structures out of London. “I think now, being on this political precipice as we are after that result, the worst since – now is the time for telling the truth.” He said Labour must overcome the internal divisions that have riven the party during Jeremy Corbyn leadership, and reach out beyond party boundaries to other progressive campaigners. “Do I think we can go on another five years divided as we are? I don’t. I really don’t. Not just as a Labour party. Divided parties fall. But it also as a progressive movement in this country. How can we stop trying to dictate to what you would call progressives in the UK?” He decried what he called “Labourism”: the mentality that Labour is the leading leftwing force in British politics, and that those outside it, in other parties and beyond, are “viewed with suspicion”. “We can actually begin to build the cement of those alliances that are actually going to be needed to take on the Tories: on climate, on racism, on democracy in our society. That can be by working together with others who want the same thing,” he said. And he warned against the leadership race being used as an opportunity for a different section of the party to take control. “I think most people, including MPs, are tired of the swing that gone on, in the postwar period, between left and right – where one faction takes over, and sees it as its almost God-given right to suppress the other side,” he said. “What we had under the New Labour years wasn’t unity, it was hegemony. The left did exist, but it existed in a tomb.” He called for a thorough review of Labour internal democratic processes, to be overseen by a “deliberative convention” of party members. Corbyn leadership pitch included a pledge to democratise the party; but Lewis said that had been “lost along the way”. Giving examples of reforms he would like to see, he cited giving constituency branches the power to decide whether they would stand candidates aside for other likeminded parties such as the Greens. And after Labour was reduced to a single MP in Scotland at the general election, he said Scottish Labour must be able to decide what its policy should be on independence. “In Wales and Scotland, it about saying that the December result was more than just a devastating election defeat; more than just a Brexit outcome; it was also about, I think, the ability for the union to survive in its current configuration,” he said. “Now what form that takes I don’t know; but the change is coming. And I think what we now have to do for our Scottish and Welsh colleagues is to say to them, we want to give you full autonomy, to decide the best way forward now. Is that for some kind of devo-max federal structure? Or is it for you to campaign for an independent Scotland, independent Wales? That should be their choice.” Unlike most of his rivals, Lewis is cautious about criticising last month manifesto – but says the party had failed to prepare the ground adequately for such a radical set of policies. “I loved that manifesto,” he said. “In many ways, it was almost like a fantasy football manifesto. It was a brilliant manifesto – and if you take each individual idea, I think most people who are left of centre in our party would have said: ‘I love this.’ But the trouble was, we tried to drop one of the most radical manifestos of the century in a six-week campaign, and I don’t think you can do that.” He says if he was Labour leader, the party manifesto would be developed “from the bottom up”. Lewis has only been an MP since but was quickly earmarked for promotion to the frontbench as a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn . He resigned rather than obey the three-line whip to trigger article the formal Brexit process – but had been back on the frontbench, in John McDonnell Treasury team, since He helped form the campaign group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, with colleagues including the York MP Rachael Maskell, to call for his party to embrace a second referendum. That policy was blamed by many Labour candidates for the loss of their seats in the Midlands and north last month. But Lewis claims the party would have suffered at the hands of the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats, if they hadn’t supported a people vote. “If we had had a more overtly Brexit position, arguably we would have haemorrhaged more votes.” And he says the Brexit vote was a symptom of longstanding problems in many of the “red wall” constituencies that fell to the Tories last month. “What happened in those seats, yes it about Brexit, but if you understand it in the context of the crisis in democracy, if you understand in the context that people wanted a sense of agency over their lives, of control over their lives, and they don’t have that, then you understand that this has been years in the making,” he said.",941
37,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/brexit-supporters-three-and-a-half-years-on-its-been-tortuous,"he day after the EU referendum result, on Saturday June the Daily Mail front page featured a photograph of jubilant Brexit supporters in Peterborough , under the headline “Take a bow Britain”. The paper celebrated “the day the quiet people of Britain rose up against an arrogant, out-of-touch political class and a contemptuous Brussels elite”. Speaking to the Guardian a week after the vote , some of those in the photograph criticised David Cameron for his decision to quit as prime minister, expressed concern at racist attacks in the wake of the poll , and wondered whether anyone actually had a plan. On the eve of the UK departure from the EU three and a half years later, we asked for their reflections on one of the most turbulent periods in British political history. Wayne Fitzgerald, deputy leader of Peterborough c ity c ouncil We certainly had a good night that night, in terms of celebrating. I even think one of my friends was in tears following that picture, but, of course, what happened since then has been somewhat tortuous … Since then it has just been a constant battle to enact the will of the people. I’m relieved that we have certainty now. Boris Johnson has unified the party and in many respects invigorated the country. The results of the election speak for themselves, really. We basically had a second referendum on December. Hani Mustafa, student and Conservative activist I have been quite frustrated by my own side because, while we won the battle, we didn’t continue to make the arguments for leaving the EU and at various points it looked possible that we might not leave at all. I’ve also been frustrated with those that sought to frustrate the process and simply couldn’t accept what had happened. They pulled every trick in the book to try and stop it, all under the disguise of democracy. This first part of the process has taken a long time so it nice to see that something is finally happening. I wouldn’t expect this next part to be straightforward, but we’re getting there. John Peach, former leader of Peterborough c ity c ouncil It such an iconic picture. I got it framed and put it up in my cloakroom … I’ll admit I thought things would be easier [after the vote]. I think the problem was that Theresa May was presided upon to call an election because everyone thought she was walking on water and couldn’t possibly lose it, and then she almost did. Of course, when you don’t have a majority you are in the S.H.I.T and everybody took advantage of that. I’ll be going down to London to celebrate in Parliament Square [on January]. There will be a few of us going down. I’ll be relieved and excited. Emily Fisher, Conservative activist Since the last election I just feel relieved. I was always of the opinion that people hadn’t changed their minds about Brexit and did know what they were voting for. When that result came through in the early hours of a Friday morning, it was the silent majority again saying: “No, we did know what we wanted. We still know what we want. Now deliver it.” Of course there loads to do. The relationship we have with Europe is deep and complicated. It going to take a long time to untangle and there are going to be complications along the way. I for one never thought it would be done at the drop of the hat. Adam Collins, Conservative activist I’ll do a big sigh of relief on the to be honest. It will all be over and done and dusted. Then it will be about making sure there a smooth transition. I think there are likely to be a few speed bumps along the road. Obviously, the Northern Irish border and backstop, that a bit of a sticking point at the moment, and the US and UK trade deal will need to be finalised as well. But I’m excited for the future. Our country survived on its own before we joined the EU and I don’t see why it wouldn’t survive after. Jay Beecher, secretary and deputy chair of Ukip in Peterborough I was surprised by the result only because of the huge odds that had been stacked against us - by government and EU-peddled propaganda, by fatcat Europhile business owners, and by the likes of woke out-of-touch celebrities and high-profile types like Richard Branson with far too much money and time on their hands. I thought we’d have begun the process to leave far, far sooner than we did, but that was impossible with a minority government headed by a remainer. The delay itself is what caused such toxicity in British politics – not the result itself. For remain voters who were unwilling to accept democracy and the decision of the majority, delay turned into hope, hope into motivation, and motivation into becoming a movement of patronising democracy-deniers who thought they could bully their way to a rematch. Despite always admiring Boris, I held a few reservations, but I now trust him He doing a fantastic job. My main hopes for Brexit are for it to act as the catalyst for a gradual restoration of our national pride and identity. I’ve got no fears about Brexit and never have. John Whitby, former Ukip councillor I don’t look ecstatic in the picture, because too much triumphalism does not help. I’m a sports coach and I try to teach people to gracefully accept winning and losing. The division after the referendum would have healed by now if remainer politicians in government had accepted the result. But instead they allow divisions to fester. I stood in the Peterborough byelection for Ukip in June. I was supposed to be standing in the general election in Peterborough for Ukip, but I felt that would not have been a good move. I ended up voting Conservative in the election, because we needed a strong parliament that would get Brexit delivered. I’m not a Tory and I have some views that would be strongly aligned with Labour, such as on executive pay and low wages, but voting Tory was the least worst option. Boris Johnson has been making all the right sort of noises, but I will reserve judgment until the end of the year. I want the UK to become a self-governing independent nation with good trade deal with our closest trading partners. I want the UK to be highly competitive, highly successful with a huge tax take from businesses, which allows it to deliver social programmes which are the envy of the world. My fear is that we are not going to get that.",1123
38,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/on-the-stump-lowlights-of-election-campaign-that-shame-forgot,"From the stream of misinformation to the absurd pledges, the election was the campaign that shame forgot – and the electorate wished they could do likewise. It has seen Labour and the Tories fight over whether antisemitism or Islamophobia was the less appealing quality in a potential party of government. So divorced from reality have some protagonists become that one Tory minister said he didn’t know whether Jeremy Corbyn actually planned to shoot rich people (it seems unlikely – the Labour leader has pledged to grow billion extra trees and they aren’t going to plant themselves). And while it is not unknown for anti-social behaviour to become an election issue, when one of the candidates is caught urinating in the street, it probably time to pack the political class into a cab and send them home for their own good. If only that were an option. With the election days away, the result remains as unpredictable as a headcount of prime ministerial offspring. So, in the spirit of electoral masochism, the Observer looks back at the lowlights of the campaign in full. Theme of the campaign Disinformation. There was a time when the purveyors of fake news used sophisticated algorithms, rogue states and armies of online bots to propagate misleading nonsense. This was the election that proved they needn’t have bothered. Much quicker to make the untruths front and centre of the campaign, pushed by a crack team of ministers chosen for their pliability, lack of wit and jaw-dropping shamelessness. Let recap. Having promised not to send a letter asking for a Brexit delay, which proved to be untrue, Boris Johnson piled into the election pledging new hospitals – untrue. He then made the untrue claim that there would be no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, before stating that Labour would spend trillion, a claim that proved to be… you get the picture. Since then, many others have warmed to the theme. The top effort came from Tory chairman James Cleverly, who defended a video of Keir Starmer, doctored to make it look as if he couldn’t answer questions on Brexit, by saying it was a joke. Cleverly outrageous claim was never going to convince anyone – Labour Brexit policy was a joke long before Tory HQ got involved. Interview of the campaign Look no further than Johnson magisterial interview with the BBC Andrew Neil. He ducked, he swerved. Johnson ghosted past Neil like he wasn’t even there! Because he wasn’t. The interview hasn’t happened, owing to No view that scrutiny is a quaint throwback to a time when prime ministers were expected to know the size of their immediate family. If Napoleon advice was never to disrupt one enemy when they are making a mistake, Tory advisers certainly aren’t going to bother the electorate when they’re on the cusp of a faceplant. Those inside the CCHQ bunker are terrified that even breathing out too conspicuously risks disrupting the inexplicable universal imbalance that has Johnson on course for Downing Street. Policy of the campaign Free broadband! Billions for pensioners! Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has thrown the kitchen sink at convincing voters to back Labour – though the offer of free kitchen sinks is being held back for the last few days of the campaign. Should Labour win the election, Britain is either on course for socialist utopia – or it about to become the nation-state version of the Fyre Festival. For the uninitiated, that was a botched music event which promised wealthy millennials the party of a lifetime on a paradise island. They arrived to find dystopian scenes of uninhabitable tents, sodden beds and shortages of food and water. The disaster was created by a messianic leader promising the earth, getting in way over his head and failing to change course when it was obvious his plans were unachievable. So there really aren’t any obvious comparisons with Labour here. The sorry saga ends with the wealthy fleeing in their private jets, while the locals – who had hoped it would bring much needed prosperity – are left footing a big bill. I’m still talking about Fyre Festival, obviously. Claim of the campaign Get Brexit Done. It cobblers, of course, given that even if Johnson passes his Brexit agreement (aka the easy bit), it begins the painful business of deciding what life outside the EU will actually look like. But being untrue has morphed from a political problem to an absolute prerequisite in the Conservative soundbite stakes. The problem with Johnsonian misinformation is that it can take a long time to catch up with him. Take his comments from in which he described the children of single mothers as “ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate”. We’re still waiting for an apology for that one, after Johnson concluded that an election campaign “isn’t the time” to discuss what he actually thinks of the electorate. Cue sighs of relief from his team. On that timeline, we should still be waiting for an apology over Johnson Brexit pledges in – which, incidentally, is likely to coincide with the latest round of talks over Britain EU trade deal. Gaffe of the campaign Kudos to Sinn Féin candidate John Finucane, who got a ticking off from police for urinating in the street, thereby handing us a useful metaphor for the election. But the win goes to the Lib Dems, who have proved that there is no opportunity so big that it cannot be, in the parlance of the prime minister, “spaffed up the wall”. Their pledge to revoke Brexit should they win a majority was so toxic on the doorstep that candidates have been busy reassuring voters that no one would be stupid enough to elect that many of them. Let not forget that it was the Lib Dems who precipitated this election all those six weeks ago. A case of turkeys not only voting for Christmas, but offering to turn on the oven and spend the night soaking in a bath of sage and aromatics. Revelation of the campaign Huge news as some of Nigel Farage Brexit Party MEPs quit over their party strategy. The notion that Farage had a strategy was a shock. His party poll rating proves that it chiming with the electorate, whatever it is. A big reveal, too, from Ukip campaign coordinator Freddy Vachha, who pledged to wage “war by air and sea” for Brexit – suggesting its grand election plan is targeting key marginals in Dunkirk and Calais. Yet was the election that revealed that Johnson reputation as “the Heineken Tory” is at risk. If it means he a politician who can reach parts of the electorate other Tories can’t, then perhaps not. If it means he a politician who occasionally sounds like he five pints in, then maybe. Accidental encounters with real voters saw Johnson told “leave my town” and “I don’t want to meet you”. As online admirers have pointed out, for a man so opposed to socialism, Johnson displays an admirable willingness to be publicly owned. His lacklustre rendition of Wheels on the Bus at a nursery was also seized upon. His problem is that there a different class of nursery rhyme at Eton, where The Grand Old Duke of York isn’t a song, but one godfather. Good campaign SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon , has had a belter, as leaders of other parties demonstrated they didn’t give a stuff about the union, either. Johnson Brexit plans put a border down the Irish Sea, while Corbyn has signalled that a new Scottish independence referendum won’t be offered in the first year of a Labour government – hugely reassuring for unionists. But the winner has to be Tory minister Mims Davies who, before the campaign had even begun in earnest, had turned her seat from a risky marginal to a solid Tory hold. What was behind this political mastery? A ground operation? Segmented online ads? Sheer force of personality? Much simpler, actually. Davies quit the seat of Eastleigh for the safer ground of Mid Sussex. What was it about the constituency majority that attracted Davies? We’ll probably never know. Bad campaign Highly commended is Jacob Rees-Mogg, who achieved the impossible by falling foul of his party rulings on acceptable conduct. His sin was suggesting the victims of the Grenfell disaster should have applied “common sense” and ignored expert advice not to leave the burning building. This risked alerting the electorate to the possibility that the Tories, a party whose leading lights talk mainly in Latin, may not have the interests of the poor at heart. Bizarrely, Rees-Mogg recently re-emerged in a brief video shot in front of a stone circle. A baffling relic from a time long past, whose very reason for being remains hotly debated. Yes, Rees-Mogg really has been an enigma in this election. But the winner in this category is you, the electorate. In a high-stakes game of what-would-you-rather, voters will be entering the booth, looking at the options, and asking for a forfeit instead. A quick look at the election pundits For pollsters, stringing together a one-game winning streak means you are seriously hot property, which makes YouGov the Lionel Messi of the Westminster. After winning the coveted title of being the least wrong last time, it has seen everyone putting total faith in its MRP poll, which predicted a comfortable Tory majority. So what are all the polls telling us? It’ll either be a Tory landslide, a comfortable Tory win, a small Tory majority or a hung parliament. Unless that all wrong, in which case Labour will get a majority or Jo Swinson will accidentally become prime minister. But if that confusing, don’t worry. Election night will be full of pundits explaining why what has happened has happened, claiming to have predicted it all along and revealing with total certainty the long-standing factors at play.

39,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/16/the-view-from-stevenage-how-will-the-uks-first-new-town-vote,"his is a tale of two Lewises. One, Lewis Silkin, was the minister for town and country planning in Labour post-war government. Stevenage , the country first new town built in was his baby. He envisioned it becoming a “gay and bright place” that would take the community-minded “spirit of the slums” and place it in the middle of the countryside with wonderful amenities and good municipal houses with gardens front and back. The other is Lewis Hamilton , Formula One champion and Stevenage most famous son, who misspoke during the Sports Personality of the Year awards last year. In an unscripted moment, he said: “It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums.” He immediately corrected himself and later apologised. Somewhere up there Silkin stared down mouth agape, while back in Stevenage many looked on askance. Stevenage has no slums. That was the whole point. But it has seen better days. I know this because I am from Stevenage. As you walk from the train station to the centre of town you will find me featured on a wall of local notability – fame would be a stretch – just to the right of Ken Follett and opposite the truly famous Hamilton and Ashley Young . The town has changed a great deal since I left in the late – it would be strange if it hadn’t. The junior school I attended has been rebranded after consistent underperformance; my secondary school has closed down. The pedestrianised shopping centre – the first of its kind in the country opened by the Queen years ago – has lost much of its lustre. Two weeks ago the Waitrose in the old town closed down after years, taking the post office it was home to with it. “The town centre used to be buzzing but the shops keep closing down,” one local resident, who did not wish to be named, wrote to tell the Guardian community team. “Everywhere you look there a boarded-up shop.” For all Silkin grand dreams, Stevenage is now like much of the rest of the country. Austerity has bitten. With a food bank and one in four children in poverty, many are struggling. And, with just unemployment, they are literally working through it. It votes like the rest of the country too. Indeed, in every election since it has voted for the party that formed the government. In an electoral map full of microclimates, it remains a bellwether. It is on Labour target list. The Tories have just a majority of and could lose it on just a swing. Always treated like a marginal, but not always acting like one, the seat was comfortably held by New Labour. The Conservatives have generally benefitted from Labour and the Liberal Democrats , or Social Democrats before them, splitting the vote. Ominously, given Nigel Farage recent announcement, the only time the Tories topped was in when Ukip did not run. In Stevenage voted to leave the European Union ( a figure far closer to Sunderland than that other famous New Town, Milton Keynes) and Brexit is a key issue among voters, although if responses to our community call-out are anything to go by that as likely to be because people fear it will happen as much as fearing it won’t. Housing is also a key concern. One of the most common reasons people of my parents’ generation moved to Stevenage was because of the impressive stock of council housing. Those days seem long gone. Jordan, who is a cook at the bingo hall, is worried about housing because his girlfriend is pregnant. “We both work long hours so money is OK for now but the big fear is: will we be able to get a council house?” he said. “Everything is way too expensive.” But the most consistent concern is about the state of the Lister hospital, where my mother was once a psychiatric nurse. Matthew Gray moved back to Stevenage after studying in Canada. His wife is a nurse and was paid three times as much in Canada as she is paid here. “She is confused to why the hospitals have to ‘make do’ and also why they send so many patients to private clinics at extra cost,” he said. Silkin would be turning in his grave. Labour made Stevenage in out of concrete and high hopes, with the same zeal and sense of purpose that they would build the NHS two years later. It was part of a post-war utopian vision to create a home for “a new type of citizen – a healthy, self-respecting, dignified person with a sense of beauty, culture and civic pride”. And Stevenage made me. My teachers were excellent, my summers were fun. I played in the youth orchestra, for the youth football and cricket teams. Concrete may not age well, but people do. When I meet old friends they want to catch up and show pictures of their children and grandchildren; they ask me how I’m doing, enquire after my brothers, reminisce about my mum – who died years ago. When I turn the conversation to the election they swat me away. They’re not paying attention yet. “People from all over the world will come to Stevenage,” said Silkin. “To see how we, here in this country, are building for the new way of life.” They did not. But I am heading back, to the town of my childhood, to see where it thinks the country should go next. If you live in Stevenage we’d like you to tell us which issues you think will decide this election. Share your views here .",953
40,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/brexit-party-will-not-contest-317-tory-seats-nigel-farage-says,"Nigel Farage has said the Brexit party will not field any candidates against the Conservatives in the seats they won at the last general election, after Boris Johnson committed to leaving the EU by and pursuing a Canada-style trade deal. Farage said his party climbdown came after months of trying to create a leave alliance with the Tories, but he felt it was time to put the country before his party and make a “unilateral” move. He will announce on Friday in which seats the Brexit party is standing. Speculation continues over where the party will stand but it is not expected to run in Northern Ireland or parts of Scotland. As he spelled out his general election strategy at a rally in Hartlepool, which voted to leave the EU, Farage said he had concluded that if the Brexit party had stood a candidate in every seat it could split the vote and usher in dozens of Liberal Democrat MPs and, in turn, create the circumstances for a second referendum. He said: “The Brexit party will not contest the seats the Conservatives won at the last election. We will concentrate our total effort into all the seats that are held by the Labour party, who have completely broken their manifesto pledge in to respect the result of the referendum, and we will also take on the rest of the remainer parties. We will stand up and fight them all.” He said this strategy was reliant on Johnson sticking to his promises on delivering Brexit, and getting Brexit party MPs into parliament to keep the pressure on him. “We are going to keep saying: remember you told us we were leaving at the end of Remember you told us we’re not going to have political alignment. He will know, just as Mrs May vote disappeared in the European elections of this year, the same will happen again if a British prime minister breaks firm commitments and promises made to the British people. “I have got no great love for the Conservative party at all, but I can see right now that by giving Boris half a chance … and stopping the fanatics in the Liberal Democrats – they even want to revoke the result of the referendum – I think our action, our announcement today, prevents a second referendum from happening.” Farage said he had been reassured after Johnson said he would not accept an extension of the transition period for Britain leaving the EU beyond the end of The prime minister has also said he will negotiate a “super Canada-plus” trade deal with no political alignment, which is closer to what leave voters want. Farage, who is not standing for election himself, said he had been offered a peerage by the government on Friday but turned it down. Speculation will continue as to what he or his party will get out of the decision to stand down parliamentary candidates. Farage announcement lifted sterling on the foreign exchange markets. The pound hit a six-month high against the euro, at Sterling was also up a cent against the US dollar at City traders are calculating that a hung parliament is now less likely – although the Brexit party will still be competing in Conservative target seats. Other political parties were quick to criticise the move, with Ian Lavery, the chair of the Labour party, saying Johnson had formed an alliance with Farage and in effect Donald Trump, with whom he has a close relationship. Lavery said: “This is a Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson alliance with Donald Trump to sell out our country and send per week from our NHS to US drugs companies.” Ed Davey, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “Nigel Farage standing down shows the Conservatives and the Brexit party are now one and the same. Johnson hard-right Brexit takeover of the Tory party has now been endorsed by both Trump and Farage.” Some people in the audience sighed with disappointment when the decision was announced. However, a local supporter called Dave Paul said he trusted Farage strategy: “He Mr Brexit. We are right behind Nigel.” Alice Burke, from Buckinghamshire, who was in the area and decided to attend the Hartlepool rally, said: “My experience of Nigel is he a well thought-through strategist. He probably agonised over this decision but he got the courage to stand up for what he believes in. “I don’t think he looks weak. It a well thought-out strategy. He can’t please everybody.” Hartlepool voted leave at the EU referendum and is represented by the Labour MP Mike Hill, who voted in the Commons to block a no-deal Brexit. It is one of the Brexit party key targets and the party chair, Richard Tice, has already announced he is running for the seat . Ukip has mounted a strong challenge in this traditional Labour heartland in recent elections. In Ukip received a share of the vote, compared with for Labour. In Ukip support dropped to of the vote and fell behind the Conservatives. Hartlepool borough council is run by the Brexit party in coalition with three Conservative councillors. Peter Mandelson held the seat between and for Labour.",864
41,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/richard-braine-quits-ukip-leader-after-less-than-three-months,"The Ukip leader, Richard Braine , has resigned after less than three months in the post after a clash with the party national executive, leaving Ukip seeking its seventh permanent leader since A party spokesman confirmed that Braine had said he would step down. It comes just over a week after Braine said the national executive had tried to suspend him amid a struggle for control of the party. One source said Ukip appeared to be on its last legs as a party, and might potentially field no candidates in the general election in December. In a resignation letter seen by the Kipper Central website , Braine said his efforts to lead the party had been “met with pre-emptive opposition” from senior figures including the Ukip chair, Kirstan Herriot, including a block on appointments. “I did not join Ukip in order to waste time on internal conflict, but I have found myself powerless to prevent a purge of good members from the party,” Braine wrote. “I had believed that Ukip was a highly democratic party, but I have not been able to stop political interference in Ukip ballots. I cannot therefore stand publicly for Ukip with a clear conscience.” The row has formed part of a wider tussle over the future of the party following Braine election in August to replace Gerard Batten as leader. Herriot and some other national executive members had hoped the election would mean an end to the focus on anti-Islam policies seen under Batten, who appointed the far-right activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser . However, Braine has endorsed Batten views, using his first press conference as leader to reiterate views about what he claims is a expansionist, violent culture within Islam. The national executive responded by seeking to bar Batten-associated members from standing in just-completed elections to the body, as part of an effort to seize control. Amid the infighting, Braine tenure has been marked by a slump in membership and spats such as the leader declining to attend Ukip annual conference because of poor ticket sales. Herriot said the decision was “a complete insult to the membership”. At its peak under Nigel Farage leadership, Ukip won almost votes in the general election, coming third by vote share but only securing one MP, due to the voting system. But since Farage stepped down in Ukip has been buffeted by crises, and a series of short-lived leaders. It is now polling at less than having been largely supplanted by Farage new Brexit party.",418
42,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/ukip-attempts-to-suspend-leader-amid-fresh-power-struggle-within-party-richard-braine,"Ukip has moved to suspend its leader Richard Braine amid a fresh power struggle within the party. On Saturday Braine confirmed that Ukip national executive committee (NEC) and the party chair, Kirstan Herriot, had attempted to oust him but questioned whether she had the authority to do so. Braine said: “As I understand it the chairman has asked that I am suspended but I am not really sure whether that possible or whether she has the authority to do that. But at any rate – so what. I don’t really accept that the chairman has that power. “If the NEC of the party wishes to get rid of a leader then it has a vote of no confidence. I’m not aware that there has been any vote.” He added the last time this had happened was when former leader Henry Bolton was ousted in When asked about the motivation for his attempted suspension, he alleged that “Ukip NEC is carrying out a purge of members that it does not approve of. But I do not approve of that.” He also alleged that members of the party NEC have been staying on past their agreed terms – an apparent contravention of the party constitution. Asked what he would do next, he replied: “Get on with the job.” Former Ukip leader Gerard Batten tweeted in relation to the matter: “The chairman &amp; NEC are out to destroy Ukip. In addition to running a gerrymandered NEC election they have now ‘suspended’ the membership of the party leader.” Britain was complacent about the far right. Now it out in force Batten alleged Braine had already sacked Herriot before the suspension was made. The news comes after Braine was accused of a “complete insult” in response to his decision to boycott his own party conference amid low-ticket sales. Ukip, notorious for its public spats, was engulfed in yet another last month when it failed to sell more than tickets to its two-day conference. In an email sent to all members at the time, Herriot, backed by Ukip NEC, said Braine decision not to attend had been a complete affront to “hard-working” party members. She confirmed the conference would go ahead despite Braine no-show. She wrote: “Both I and the NEC believe it is a complete insult to the membership to attempt to cancel the conference because of a potentially low turnout.

Braine said he had proposed moving the conference to a venue in north-east England and suggested ticket sales could be boosted by “returning Gerard Batten to good standing to heal the rift with the many members who are boycotting the conference for that reason”. He claimed his advice was rejected.

43,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/17/ukip-leader-accused-of-insulting-party-over-conference-no-show,"The leader of Ukip has been accused of a “complete insult” after he decided to boycott his own party conference due to low ticket sales. Richard Braine has pulled out of the conference after fewer than tickets were sold for the two-day event. The party was hoping to attract double the amount of delegates to the event in Newport, south Wales, later this month. In the latest furore to engulf the party infamous for its public spats, the Ukip chair, Kirstan Herriot, wrote to all members stating new leader Braine had attempted to cancel the conference due to a potentially low turnout. In the email sent to all members, Herriot, backed by Ukip ruling national executive committee (NEC), said Braine stance had been a complete affront to “hard-working” party members. She confirmed the conference would go ahead despite Braine no-show. New Ukip leader condemned for 'virulent Islamophobia' She wrote: “Both I and the NEC believe it is a complete insult to the membership to attempt to cancel conference because of a potentially low turn out. It is also a particular affront to hard-working regional, county and branch officers who have worked hard in encouraging members to attend conference to hear Richard lay out his vision for the future of Ukip. It is therefore a particular shame that he has decided not to do this.” In order to increase delegate numbers, the party said it had now decided to offer some free single-day tickets and those who had paid for their one-day ticket would be offered a refund. Herriot email added that Braine was still welcome to take his “rightful place” on the conference stage should he have a “change of heart”. Ukip has suffered a slump in the polls following the rise of the Brexit party, which was founded by Nigel Farage after he quit Ukip over the former leader Gerard Batten anti-Islam views and links to the far-right activist Tommy Robinson.

Braine said he had proposed moving the conference to a venue in north-east England and called for Batten to be reinstated to the party. He claimed the NEC had been misinformed about the number of attendees, with the real number being much lower. He wrote: “I have made clear to the chairman and NEC that I would not attend unless something drastic was done to increase ticket sales, namely returning Gerard Batten to good standing to heal the rift with the many members who are boycotting conference for that reason, and installing one of the two candidates I have put forward to be chairman.” Braine claims his advice was rejected.",526
44,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/22/leaked-emails-show-ukip-leader-richard-braine-comparing-muslims-nazis,"Richard Braine , the new Ukip leader, has been accused of whipping up religious tensions and anti-Muslim prejudice after leaked emails showed he argued that people should no more want Muslims to settle in their country than Nazis. Braine, who won the leadership after a campaign in which he expressed anti-Islam views, also suggested that non-Muslims needed to help Muslims to “cast out their demon” and argued there was no such thing as “moderate Muslims”. One email reads: “The nonsense of the moderate Muslim is trotted out repeatedly by so many people with good intentions, but wilful ignorance of Islamic teaching. There is no moderate Islam . Get used to it. It a fact. When people talk about moderate Muslims they are making an error. It is like saying Hitler wasn’t such a bad fellow, quite a laugh actually, an entertaining speaker, a patron of the arts – he loved Wagner – he made the trains run on time, and just look at his smart uniforms. It is to ignore completely the ideology to which the person is religiously wedded.” He added: “You should no more apologise for a moderate Muslim, and wish him to settle in your country, than you should a moderate Maoist or Nazi.” The emails to associates were leaked to the Guardian from within Ukip because of alarm among some left in the dwindling party about its continued links with the far-right figure Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. Matthew McGregor from the anti-fascist campaign group Hope Not Hate said Ukip was now “the party of Tommy Robinson and anti-Muslim prejudice”. “Despite all the chaos around Brexit, the party is mired at in the polls. They’re seeking to stoke tension in communities in the desperate hope of regaining relevancy. It time for them to join previous failed far-right parties in the dustbin of history,” he said. Braine disputed the accusation that his comments were whipping up hatred against Muslims and took issue with the allegation that he was Islamophobic on the grounds that it was not irrational to have a problem with Islamic scripture. He said: “It was part of a discussion about the fact there are many immoderate verses in Islamic scripture. It was about the immoderate verses that essentially cannot be denied by moderate Muslims. In Islam in its proper scriptural sense you are not free to deny verses like say Surah verse It is not moderate and it does promote the slaughter of the infidel.” Asked if he really believes Muslims want to slaughter “infidels”, he said: “Clearly not. What is wonderful is that Muslims are good people like the rest of us but it is the scripture that encourages violence.” Asked about the accusation that he is Islamophobic and whipping up hatred against Muslims, Braine said: “I certainly don’t wish to whip up ill feeling or hatred. I don’t believe in hatred, I come from a part of the world that has its basis as Christianity. And I myself am someone who I’d like to think is pretty kindly to everyone I meet ... But to some extent I reject the criticism of Islamophobia for the reason we have had a large number of violent Islamic attacks in countries and I normally think of Islamophobia as an irrational fear. I don’t think Islamophobia is appropriate for people scared of violent attacks routinely that we see in the press and on the streets of Britain.” On the comparison of Muslims with Nazis and Maoists, he said: “It a matter of degree. There have been people who supported their ideologies in Britain and there probably are people in Britain today who are Maoists and Nazis. The question is: do you support scriptures that promote or command the killing of people? ... I’m not saying Maoism is the same as Nazism or Nazism is the same as Islam. But I do think in each case we are talking about the kind of extremism and ideologies that are to some extent disregarding the value of human life.” When presented with the four emails in full and asked for a response, a Ukip spokesman said: “The sentences are taken out of a wider context. Without the context, it impossible to see the point that was being made.” The issue of Islamophobia has deeply divided Ukip, which has slumped in the polls and is struggling for relevance in the face of the rise of the Brexit party, founded by Nigel Farage after he quit Ukip over the former leader Gerard Batten anti-Islam views and links to Robinson. Ukip ruling national executive committee was so alarmed at Batten stance that it blocked him from standing again for the leadership, but his ally Braine was elected instead by the membership.

45,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/richard-braine-attacks-media-and-claims-eu-cult-betrays-brexit,"The newly-elected Ukip leader, Richard Braine , has claimed Brexit is being betrayed by “a traitor class” in the establishment and the media, which he sees as conspiring with the EU. In a lengthy and at times free-wheeling inaugural press conference in London, Braine lambasted what he portrayed as the “EU cult” and reiterated his views about what he saw as an expansionist, violent culture within Islam. But his strongest language was reserved for the media. He opened the event by saying he had been abused and shouted at the previous evening by a journalist “full of loathing”. “My abuser is an example of a new extremism which is being fuelled by a powerful establishment in this country,” Braine said. “Our establishment does the EU bidding, and want to turn around the result of Ukip glorious referendum. “I ask you, the media, to cease and desist from stirring this up. Stop calling people uneducated, hateful bigots, racists, scum. Stop calling people far-right when they’re not far-right.” Asked who was controlling this media narrative, Braine said: “I think they’re being controlled by an EU federalist class. I would go so far as to say a traitor class, people who are conspiring with foreign powers against the people of this country.” New Ukip leader condemned for 'virulent Islamophobia' Braine took over from Gerard Batten at the weekend after winning more than half the Ukip members’ votes in a four-way contest. He was nominated by Batten, and shares similar far-right views on Islam, which the former leader called a death cult . Asked why he had questioned whether the public distribution of the Qur’an could fall foul of laws over incitement to violence, Braine said the UK needed to “look at the relationship between those verses and why some people seem to be motivated to go out and commit these acts”. He dismissed the idea that a literalist reading of aspects of the Bible could also be problematic: “In Islam, over years, we’ve seen expansionist conquests, jihad, over battles in Europe. So I think it a very dangerous thing that you’re doing, trying to pretend that these two scriptures or religious traditions are equivalent.” At a hustings event during the leadership race, Braine argued that there were now UK towns and cities which were effective no-go areas for non-Muslims. Asked at the press conference to give examples, he cited YouTube footage of “people being made to feel very uncomfortable in areas of east London”, but declined to give details. Braine inherits a party bumping along at tiny levels in the polls, with much of its former support taken by the Brexit party of Ukip former leader Nigel Farage. Announcing a new policy forum for members to suggest ideas, Braine insisted Ukip would remain relevant, and said the Brexit party could vanish if the UK left the EU on October. “I think that at that point the Brexit party will just disappear, like Vote Leave did, just gone,” he said. “I can’t see it continuing after that. Ukip different, we’ve been at it years. The party has an embedded culture of old-fashioned, libertarian conservatives.” Braine suggested Ukip could take part in a pro-Brexit electoral pact at a general election, saying his party did not have the resources to stand candidates in all Westminster seats. He also said the party could exert indirect influence, as in the case of Brexit: “If we get our policies right, if we manage to get through to people, and if our ideas enable us to apply pressure on the bigger parties, there is no reason why we can’t continue to get our policy implemented, whether we’re elected or not.”",610
46,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/12/new-ukip-leader-condemned-for-virulent-islamophobia,"The newly-elected leader of Ukip has been condemned for “virulent Islamophobia” after footage emerged of him arguing it should be illegal to publicly distribute the Qur’an in the UK and that some British towns are no-go areas for non-Muslims. Speaking to Ukip members at hustings, Richard Braine also claimed that British Islam has particular problems with bigamy and welfare abuse, and referred to the jailed far-right anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson as a “political prisoner”. Braine, a former chair of Ukip west London branch, was previously relatively unknown outside the party but won more than half the votes in a four-way leadership ballot. Ukip national executive had hoped the successor to Gerard Batten would move the party on from Batten increasingly far-right, anti-Islam views . However, Braine was backed by Batten and seems set to continue his legacy. Last month Braine was filmed arguing at a hustings in Grantham, Lincolnshire, that handing out copies of the Qur’an should be illegal under laws connected to incitement to violence. “We have laws against incitement, and yet there are people handing out Qur’ans in Leicester Square off a trestle table – a book which tells people to kill us to please God. We’ve got to stop incitement in public places like that.” He went on: “We’ve got to stop bigamy, welfare abuse. We’ve got to educate people in this country so they understand what the Qur’an says, what Islam really is, so they understand that it contains a hundred instructions to maim and slaughter innocent people – homosexuals, the infidel, women, apostates. So we need to understand what is in that book, we need to educate ourselves and our children about that.” Braine claimed there was the issue of “towns and cities becoming increasingly Islamic to the point where essentially, as a non-Islamic person, you’re simply not welcome there. And we’ve got to stop that.” Calling Islam an “alien ideology”, Braine told the audience there was a danger it could “become a supremacist ideology in this country”. A Ukip spokesman later said: “Ukip is not an anti-Islam party.” At another hustings in Sunderland, Braine described Robinson as “a political prisoner”. Robinson is currently serving a sentence after being found guilty of contempt of court . Braine also praised Batten for allying with him : “I’m proud that we had a leader who had the guts to stand up for someone who was in prison wrongly.” A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain said: “Ukip continued descent into even greater depths of bigotry is only matched by its growing irrelevance and obscurity. Virulent Islamophobia was not a successful tactic under the previous Ukip leadership, and will not be this time. Our nation knows better.” The issue of Islamophobia has deeply divided Ukip which has slumped in the polls and is struggling for relevance in the face of the rise of the Brexit party, founded by Nigel Farage after he quit Ukip over Batten anti-Islam views and links to Robinson. Ukip NEC was so alarmed at Batten stance that it blocked him from standing again for the leadership, with Braine seen as his proxy.

Following his victory, Braine said he wanted to establish Ukip as the “far-moderate voice of common sense” in Britain. “We have got a great future and we are coming back. I am very excited and looking forward to leadership of this party, bringing the members together and delivering better results,” he said.

48,politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/10/ukip-to-replace-gerard-batten-with-new-leader,"Ukip is to announce the results of yet another leadership election on Saturday as the party seeks to reinvent itself after its flirtation with the far right under Gerard Batten and somehow regain political relevance. Ukip has nosedived in the polls since Nigel Farage , its former leader and central figure, quit to form the Brexit party, dropping from close to near the end of last year to not far above zero. The party appears to have been badly damaged under Batten, who took over on a supposedly interim basis months ago but led Ukip in a far-right, vehemently anti-Islam direction, appointing the now-jailed far-right activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser . Such is the disquiet about Batten approach in Ukip national executive that he was barred from standing again, prompting a threat of legal action. It is understood that Batten was blocked partly because the NEC felt his drive to the far right and links to Robinson had alienated voters, but also because he declined to be interviewed by NEC members before the contest. Instead, one among four little-known Ukip activists will lead the party after a relatively low-key announcement at the party headquarters in Devon on Saturday. This will be Ukip fifth permanent leader since Farage stepped down just under three years ago. The best known is Mike Hookem, until May a Ukip MEP, and formerly its deputy leader. His moment of greatest prominence came in when he was involved in a bizarre scuffle with fellow party MEP Steven Woolfe, after which Woolfe was taken to hospital. Another perceived frontrunner is Ben Walker, a long-time activist and NEC member from Gloucestershire. Also standing are two London-based senior members, Freddy Vachha and Richard Braine. While the party membership is still relatively large at turnout is expected to be low, making predictions difficult. Kirstan Herriot, the Ukip chair, said: “It is a new start. That what the overwhelming majority of the party are looking forwards to. Whoever wins this leadership election is going to provide Ukip with that fresh start.” Not all agree with this sentiment. Braine was nominated for leader by Batten, and has promised to make him his deputy if he wins. One senior party insider said: “If Richard wins it might not be the new start everyone wants, as he seen as Gerard man, and likely to continue in the same direction. You’d then expect some clashes with the NEC.” When Farage stepped down as leader in September he was replaced by Diane James, who quit after just days . The next permanent leader was Paul Nuttall, who left after the party disastrous performance in the general election. Members then chose Henry Bolton, but he was forced out amid a crisis over his leadership skills and his relationship with Jo Marney, a party activist and model. Batten was then installed without a contest with a brief to steady the party and rescue its finances, which he did. However, his far-right stance, and particularly his closeness to Robinson, saw a string of senior members quit, among them Farage .",511

And taking a swipe at Boris Johnson , who retreated to a fridge in a Yorkshire dairy farm rather than facing questioning, the Labour leader added: “I don’t have to hide in a fridge when somebody comes to asks me a question.” Boris Johnson said the race was getting “tighter and tighter”, urging supporters they have a “national duty to find every vote to save our country from disaster”. Michel Barnier , the EU chief Brexit negotiator, said it would be “unrealistic” for the EU to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal with the UK by the end next year. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said it had been “a privilege and honour” to lead the party during the election campaign. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon , who has been campaigning in Edinburgh, urged Scottish voters to back her party, saying that supporting others “risks helping the Tories”. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage fears that a Conservative majority would see “Brexit sold out” and believes “we will be back in crisis by May next year as we face extension to the whole process, which has to be done by July”. The Green Party promised that its MPs would respond to the “climate emergency alarm”. The Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has called for a law to stop politicians lying to voters. The “presidential” nature of a campaign dominated by the leaders of the two largest parties has been illuminated by research that also reveals how Labour and the Conservatives have hidden away senior figures deemed to be embarrassing or “off message”. Brandon Lewis , the security minister, told the Peston programme that Boris Johnson “has huge empathy and passion to see people get the very best service and care which is why he wants to increase funding for the NHS” following the furore of the prime minister initially refusing to look at a picture of an ill child lying on the floor at Leeds Infirmary. John McDonnell told ITV Peston programme he believes Labour will win a majority or “form a minority government and implement our manifesto” without any pacts. He cited the opinion polls which incorrectly predicted a huge Conservative majority. More than three million women who believe they have been left out of pocket after steep increases to the state pension age have been promised compensation by Labour as part of a billion scheme. On the pledge and criticisms over the party manifesto on tackling poverty, shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Peston programme: “That will be dealt with by progressive taxation. This is not about benefits, it is about entitlement. “We are ending the benefits freeze, scrapping the Bedroom Tax, introducing a real living wage.” John McDonnell has praised previous Labour government domestic policy on the Peston programme. Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson has restated her position that her party would never enter a coalition with either the Conservatives or a Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn . She told ITV Peston programme that she could work with another Labour leader however. Thursday Times leads on the threat posed by the Brexit Party.

She received nearly more votes than Donald Trump, but of course Trump received more electoral votes. So instead I say: “If Hillary Clinton had become president” or “If the outcome of the election had been different … ” Finishing the sentence requires less finessing on my part; it is perfectly clear: “… I would not have written a Hillary novel.” If Hillary had become president, I wouldn’t have needed to. Instead of watching in real time as our country becomes a more racist, sexist, xenophobic and homophobic place, Americans would have had a leader committed not just to equality among people but also to addressing climate change, gun law reform and healthcare. And it seems equally unprovable and indisputable that her response to a global pandemic would have been vastly different – science-based, measured, compassionate. But instead we live in this world, not that one, and, for my own sake, I did need to write a novel in which the US presidential election unfolded differently. I’m and it was only a few years ago, after well over three decades of writing fiction, that I realised I have devoted much of my life to this creative act for two reasons above all: to entertain myself and to soothe myself. Writing Rodham was definitely an example of the latter. Plus, it tapped into my fascination with politics, fame, and the discrepancy between our public and private selves – all themes I first explored in my novel American Wife , which was a fictionalised retelling of the life of Laura Bush. But where American Wife mostly embellishes the real or historical timeline, Rodham creates a parallel universe. What I didn’t know when I embarked on writing in March was how much I’d teach myself – or perhaps I should say how much Hillary would teach me. These are some of the lessons I learned: Multi-decade rumour mill notwithstanding, it hard to find examples of things Hillary has done wrong. The false accusations levelled at her range from murky acts of financial malfeasance, to bonkers conspiracy theories about paedophilia, to persistent suggestions that she mishandled email when she was secretary of state. On close examination, what striking about these supposed scandals is that they either have no relationship to reality or she being accused of something that I (and admittedly I’m not a lawyer) would not at first glance understand to be inappropriate, let alone illegal. After reading multiple accounts of the controversy around “Whitewater”, Bill and Hillary late real estate investment, I still would struggle to cogently summarise the sequence of events to another human. This murkiness contrasts with the events that currently unfold on a weekly basis in the White House – consider the New York Times headline on April “Trump (the Company) Asks Trump (the Administration) for Hotel Relief ” – that prompt me to sincerely wonder, how can this possibly be legal? I don’t see Hillary as saintly, but the two damning titbits that emerged about her in my research that have stayed with me are actually absurdly insignificant. The first is that, according to biographer Carl Bernstein, in the Clintons travelled together to St Louis, Missouri. Hillary told an aide to leave Bill briefcase aboard Air Force One, but when Bill later asked for it, Hillary supposedly told him: “Your staff always does that ... They don’t serve you well.” This is not, I’d venture to say, grounds for locking her up. Nor is the other scrap of scandal: New York Times reporter Amy Chozick, who covered the campaign, describes in her book Chasing Hillary how, at events, members of Hillary staff sometimes confiscated supporters’ homemade signs and instructed them to hold up mass-produced campaign signs instead. Then again, given the ease with which one can find photos that show supporters holding homemade placards and flags, this practice doesn’t seem to have been widespread – and in any event, it safe to assume it wasn’t Hillary herself doing the confiscating. Many see Hillary as either irredeemably corrupt or heroic – little attention is given to the possibility she neither The disparity between the vitriolic criticism Hillary has faced and who she actually is seems to be so great that it reminds me of that optical illusion – itself a sexist binary – where from one angle the image looks like a beautiful young woman and from another angle like a hag. Many Americans perceive Hillary as either irredeemably corrupt or heroic, with little apparent attention given to the possibility that she neither. Sometimes while writing, I thought that if, in a parallel universe, I ended up sitting next to her at a dinner party and she were exactly the same person but instead of going into politics was a university president or corporate executive, I would be dazzled by her. “That woman is so smart ,” I’d think. “She so tough and interesting and impressive .” If Bill Clinton had wanted to marry me in I’d have accepted. When I decided that the premise of my novel would be “What if Hillary hadn’t married Bill?”, it wasn’t because I find Bill loathsome. I do find him very flawed – some of his behaviour has been disturbing at best – but my main goal was to examine chance, fate, free will and the notion of parallel universes or other, unlived lives. As Hillary has mentioned publicly more than once, in the early she was initially reluctant to accept Bill marriage proposals. Indeed, as an epigraph for Rodham , I chose these lines from her memoir What Happened : “My marriage to Bill Clinton was the most consequential decision of my life. I said no the first two times he asked me. But the third time, I said yes. And I’d do it again.” It seems facile and preposterous to claim that if Hillary hadn’t married Bill she’d be president today It seems facile and preposterous to claim that if only she hadn’t married him, she’d be president today. On the one hand, if almost anything in had happened differently, that seems a likely outcome, but on the other hand, who knows? And while I used this particular marital departure from reality for fiction, Bill charms aren’t lost on me. In fact, in June I tweeted a picture of his almost thousand-page memoir along with the comment: “VERY unexpected outcome of writing my Hillary novel – I myself am now in grave danger of falling in love with Bill .” In his autobiography My Life , Bill is a funny, self-deprecating raconteur with an excellent eye for colourful details (especially of the southern fried variety) and an apparent fondness for almost everyone he has ever met. Plus, the photos of him and Hillary from back then, along with the ones in her memoir Living History , are downright swoony. Though the couple are far less polished-looking than now, she pretty and he dashing, and in pictures from their wedding, they gaze at each other with adoring intensity. In the present day, it never a foregone conclusion that an ambitious man will be smitten with an ambitious woman; years ago, it was all the more notable. And though I’ve never met either Clinton, his in-person charisma is legendary. In fact, in response to my tweet about Bill, one of my Twitter followers shared that someone she knew had seen him in a London department store shortly after the news of his affair with Monica Lewinsky had emerged. The woman approached, planning to tell him he was a national embarrassment. Instead, as they shook hands, she exclaimed, “I love you!” The Clintons just might have a good marriage. In late January when Bill first presidential campaign hung in the balance due to the cabaret singer Gennifer Flowers recent allegation that she’d had a affair with him, he and Hillary sat for a joint interview with the news show Minutes . “I think most Americans would agree that it very admirable that you’ve stayed together,” said the journalist Steve Kroft. “That you’ve worked your problems out and that you’ve seemed to reach some sort of understanding and arrangement.” Kroft and the Clintons were in a hotel suite in New Hampshire, the Clintons on a loveseat across from their interlocutor, and Bill quickly responded: “Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You’re looking at two people who love each other. This is not an arrangement or an understanding. This is a marriage. That a very different thing.” I don’t think Hillary will read the book, and if she does, she won't like it – it not a straightforward love letter When this interview aired, I watched it in my boarding school dorm; I was and had never had a boyfriend. I’ve now been married for years, and the pertinent question doesn’t seem to be, is the Clintons’ marriage an arrangement? The question is, what marriage isn’t? Yes, I understand that Kroft was essentially saying: “Do you not love each other but stay together anyway because of your shared ambition?” But this question itself seems simplistic, a pretence that the default mode of marriage is happily ever after. I don’t know any couple for whom it this easy. I believe that the Clintons genuinely enjoy each other company, are genuinely interested in each other opinions, have considered divorce and made the choice not to pursue it. At the risk of sounding cynical, it possible such a dynamic is about the best any of us can hope for. I sometimes think about how their marriage outlasted that of Bill vice-president, Al Gore , and his former wife Tipper. Little information was public about the Gores’ marriage, whereas I know as much about the Clintons’ marriage as I do about my own. Or maybe – bear with me here – I don’t. Maybe every marriage is unknowable except to the people inside it. In the United States, it rare to hear the unfiltered voices of female politicians. More than a year after it had aired, I learned about the existence of a campaign podcast created by the Clinton Foundation . Called With Her , it was hosted by a quintessentially podcasty guy named Max Linsky – a smart, casual Brooklyn-based white man – and featured interviews with Hillary, Bill, Chelsea, vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine, and assorted campaign staff members. From the first seconds of listening to it, I was aware of something weird and unfamiliar in its tone, though it took a few minutes to pinpoint what: Hillary was not being addressed with reflexive scepticism and cynicism, and she therefore did not need to respond defensively. The assumption was not that she was a power-hungry Machiavellian. The assumption was that she was a likable hard worker who cares about the American people. Even more disorienting: the person giving her the benefit of the doubt was male. As research, I read many articles and watched many news segments from the autumn of before the election, and there is a weary undertone to almost all of them, a kind of irritation that Hillary will be the first female president when she so, you know, polarising and baggage-laden. Her victory is both foregone and irksome. This undertone would seem laughably wide of the mark were it not for the fact that so many Americans have paid such a high price for the ignorance. Also as research, I listened to audiobooks by all the female senators running for president in Kirsten Gillibrand , Kamala Harris , Amy Klobuchar , and Elizabeth Warren . They narrate their own books, and, once again, to listen to their literal voices was to feel a heartening disorientation. They got to speak for as long as they wanted without interruption, tell their own stories, and present themselves, instead of being presented through the lens of America profound ambivalence about, or outright aversion to, women in power. Of course I understand that these kinds of books are a form of campaigning, but I’m not convinced that being in charge of the way you are portrayed makes your portrayal inherently false. Based on my remarks here, a person could be forgiven for thinking I wrote Rodham because I’m such an ardent fan of Hillary. This isn’t quite right. I am a fan of Hillary, but, to answer a question I’ve already been asked many times, I don’t think she’ll read the book, and if she does, I don’t necessarily think she’ll like it. It not a straightforward love letter. The character I’ve created makes personal and professional tradeoffs. She not perfect, and the character of Bill is (spoiler alert) even less so. Also, the sex scenes are way too detailed. I’d argue that it less that my novel grew out of my admiration for Hillary and more that my admiration grew out of my research about her. For my entire adulthood, she has been not merely a public figure but a cultural touchstone. Many Americans still say they don’t know her, yet she shown us over and over who she is: how strong and capable, how caring and complicated. We just have to choose to see her.

The handwritten cards show that in decades before he wrote his novel The Old Man and the Sea , Hemingway was borrowing Joshua Slocum memoir, Sailing Alone Around the World. And the records, scrawled by the shop clerks, chart how Stein matched intellectual pursuits with lighter reading including TH Crosfield historical romance A Love in Ancient Days, and Andrew Soutar fantasy Equality Island. When Sylvia Beach opened Shakespeare and Company in English-language books were expensive and hard to find in Paris. Writers and artists who had flocked to the capital of literary modernism rushed to sign up for Beach library service. Along with Hemingway and Stein, writers from Aimé Césaire to Simone de Beauvoir , Jacques Lacan, Walter Benjamin and Joyce all became members – and would have been chased up for late returns with a drawing of an exasperated Shakespeare pulling out his hair . Beach published Joyce controversial novel Ulysses in and kept the shop open until when she was forced to close after refusing to sell her last copy of Joyce Finnegans Wake to a Nazi officer. George Whitman opened a new incarnation of the shop in , and Beach papers were acquired by Princeton University in The university has been working since to digitise records from the vast archive, which runs to boxes, making them available to researchers online for the first time as part of the Shakespeare and Company project . Joshua Kotin, an associate professor of English at Princeton and the project director, said that Beach was a “meticulous, obsessive record keeper”, and that “we are only now developing digital tools that will allow us to understand and realise the archive potential”. “There are so many treasures left to be discovered. If you stack all the papers in the archive, it would be a tower,” he said. “I’m still finding treasures – for example, just before the pandemic hit, I found a manuscript for George Antheil Ballet Mécanique which Antheil gave to Beach.” The records reveal that Hemingway borrowed more than books, from PT Barnum autobiography to Lady Chatterley Lover, which he checked out for eight days in September – the year DH Lawrence novel first appeared in France, years before it was published in the US. In he borrowed a copy of Tom Jones Bull Fighting – the running of the bulls played a central part in his novel The Sun Also Rises . He also bought a copy of his own novel A Farewell to Arms at the store. “We want to understand genius,” Kotin said. “Does what Hemingway read help us understand what he wrote and why it is so great? It is also fascinating to connect our everyday practices – what we borrow from our local library, what in our Amazon cart – to the practices of people in the past. And there something illicit about learning about what and how people read – we’re learning about a very private, solitary activity.” Some of the records, he said, “tell a surprising or poignant story”. Shortly before he died, Walter Benjamin borrowed two books: a German-English dictionary, and Lord Bacon Physical and Metaphysical Works. When France fell to the Germans, Benjamin fled Paris, but he killed himself in September after Spanish police told him he would be handed over to the Gestapo. The archive makes unexpected connections, Kotin continued, with Aimé Césaire “borrowing and re-borrowing the poets of the Harlem Renaissance; Jacques Lacan borrowing an obscure book about Irish history because he reading Joyce Ulysses; Claude Cahun – under the name Mlle Lucie Schwob – reading Henry James; Gertrude Stein reading fantasy novels. So many people read so-called high-brow and low-brow work at the same time.” The archive also sheds light on the lesser-known members of the library, Kotin added, who numbered in the thousands. “I love the member Alice Killen . She was the most active member of the library. She borrowed hundreds over books over years,” he said. “The project allows us to learn about and remember these people.” The American Library Association requires libraries to destroy patron records to protect their privacy; Shakespeare and Company was not affiliated with the ALA, and Beach kept everything. “She probably should have destroyed her records,” Kotin said, “but I’m happy that she didn’t.”",751
2,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/15/research-reading-books-surged-lockdown-thrillers-crime,"A new survey has revealed that people in the UK have almost doubled the amount of time they spend reading books since lockdown began, but instead of dystopian fiction readers are turning to the “comfort” of crime and thrillers. Nielsen Book research found that of people said they were reading more books since Boris Johnson imposed the measures on March. According to the nationally representative sample of adults, surveyed from April to May, the nation has also increased the amount of time it spends reading books from around hours per week, to six. Just of adults said they were reading less. Readers also revealed their tastes have changed since the outbreak of with their interest in crime and thrillers, and other popular fiction, increasing. There was “currently little appetite” for dystopian fiction, said Nielsen. More than half of the respondents said they were reading more because they had more spare time, said it was because they wanted to stay entertained, and felt books were providing “an escape from the crisis”. Louise Doughty, who is longlisted for the Theakston Old Peculier crime novel of the year for her thriller Platform Seven, was not surprised at the increased interest in crime fiction, saying it was “a mistake to assume that during difficult times people want light, escapist reading or heartwarming tales”. “People want to be absorbed,” she said, “that means they’ll go for any book where there a story that will pull them in and hold their attention. Crime and thriller fiction, that broadest of categories, is all about that, even if it does it through the medium of tales where people do some very dark things.” Despite these dangerous undercurrents, they are genres where mysteries are resolved, Doughty continued, “and we could all do with a bit of that at the moment. The dark thing happens but there is often resolution and/or explanation at the end. In Platform Seven, I couldn’t have my narrator ghost arise from the dead but there is a strong sense at the end of the book that the dead never really leave us – if we loved them, they live on in our hearts. Paradoxically, dark books can often be the most uplifting of all.” When Peter May wrote his thriller Lockdown in publishers thought the scenario imagining London shut down by bird flu was too far-fetched. But May, who has donated his advance to those on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus, has seen sales soar since it was published last month. “I think that crime fiction represents a comforting return to the values we sometimes feel we have lost - where the forces of good win out (almost invariably) over the forces of evil,” he said. “And that is particularly relevant at a time when our world and everything familiar to us seems to have been turned upside down.” Readers seem to be finding comfort in his story of a world eerily similar to our own, May continued: “When first written it was thought that readers would not be able to identify with a world in which society has battened down the hatches against a deadly pandemic. Sadly, it has now become an only too familiar scenario. Oddly, people seem to take comfort from that, too - a familiar and common experience with which they can identify, as opposed to the ‘old’ normal, where people kissed and embraced and shook hands, and which now feels uncomfortably past tense.” Despite the clear increase in time spent reading, the survey found that changes in book buying were more evenly matched. While said they had increased purchases, had bought less, with most respondents citing their inability to visit bookshops as the reason for this decline. Waterstones said its own sales reflected Nielsen survey, with fiction and crime dominating its bestsellers, including Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams, Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens, The Dutch House by Ann Patchett and Bernardine Evaristo Girl, Woman, Other. According to Waterstones’ Bea Carvalho, success during lockdown is driven by qualities that were important long before the pandemic. “Our customers seem to be responding to recommendations for excellent, engaging storytelling across genres,” Carvalho said. “Thankfully, there have been plenty of fantastic new books to share during this period which have spoken to our need for escapist, compelling fiction.”",717
3,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/15/marcus-books-oakland-oldest-black-bookstore,"ince Oakland Marcus Books has survived one of the most dramatic gentrifications in US history, aggressive competition from online stores, and the inevitable racism directed at a space that celebrates black voices. Located in a city that saw its black population nearly halved over two decades, Marcus Books staff learned how to navigate the intense pressures and forge a path towards survival. But all those years of hard work were wiped away overnight when the Bay Area announced a strict shelter-in-place order in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, a seminal living piece of American history – the nation oldest black bookstore – is at risk of disappearing forever. “A black bookstore is not only about the exchange of merchandise,” Jasmine Johnson, whose grandparents founded Marcus Books, tells the Guardian. The disappearance of Marcus Books – which first opened in San Francisco in – and other black-centric book stores would be devastating for the larger black community, she says. “We’re really about congregating around the diversity of black living and thinking. Surviving under economic duress is nothing new to us, but this is something totally different.” The acute distress Marcus Books and other black bookstores are facinghighlights a severe disparity in reader-led funding. City Lights, an independent bookstore founded in San Francisco in and designated a landmark in launched a Go Fund Me last month and met its goal of in days. At the time of writing, the bookstore had surpassed its goal by nearly City Lights has not disclosed how it plans to allocate the excess funds, amid calls to donate them to other struggling local bookstores. Meanwhile, Marcus Books launched its Go Fund Me in April and has failed to reach even half of its goal. When asked about the stark differences in Marcus Books’ and City Lights’ fundraisers, Johnson argues: “It pretty deeply connected to what happens when you qualify anything with black. You’re met with suspicion or dismissal.” She believes fundraisers by black bookstores are viewed by the larger public as a niche interest. “The publishing industry has had a history of framing us as a ‘diversity section’.” Black bookstores have fought tooth and nail for the past three decades, as a handful closed each year. According to the African-American Literature Book Club, there were over black-owned bookstores in the In the number was slightly over . The pandemic has only exacerbated their already precarious existence. Johnson sees this as an opportunity to remind America why supporting black bookstores is important, even in normal times. “We want to come out of this and go from simply surviving to thriving,” she says of her hopes for the store fundraiser. In an industry where black authors frequently receive less attention and promotion than their white counterparts, bookstores such as Marcus Books play an important role. Malcolm X was among the shop customers, and over the years, prominent black authors such as Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison held events at the bookstore – often before they experienced crossover success and were struggling to book events elsewhere. US publishing remains 'as white today as it was four years ago' “When I was publishing in the and early and had regular tours, Marcus was one of my favorite book stops,” the science-fiction writer Tananarive Due says . Blanche Richardson, who runs the store, “is a community gem and had sold so many of my books that Marcus produced some of my largest and most enthusiastic crowds. I was so in love with Marcus that I included the store in one of the scenes in my horror novel, The Good House, as an hommage to try to capture the magic of the store. Marcus is more than a bookstore – it a neighborhood, city and state institution.” Black bookstores have always had to justify their existence and combat racism. The FBI frequently spied on them in the and when many served as cultural hubs for the Black Power movement. Johnsonsays she and other staff encountered “white-only-water-fountain-level racism” often. This continues during the pandemic: “It shows up on Twitter through people asking ‘Why does a black bookstore need to be saved? Why can’t they save themselves?’ They’re usually from anonymous accounts.” Marcus Books’ call for help is not unique. Many black bookstores across the nation have launched fundraising campaigns as last-ditch efforts to stay afloat. There Black Stone of Ypsilanti, Michigan; Eyeseeme , which specializes in black children literature, of St Louis; and L E M S of Seattle , which claims to be the last black-centric bookstore of the Pacific north-west. An entire section of black culture is under threat. Some of these stores were not equipped to compete with online sales during normal times, much less during a pandemic. Unlike many other independent bookstores, Marcus Books lacks an online operation. So, for now, the store is reliant on phone orders and storefront pickups, severely limiting business when many customers are rarely leaving their homes and turning to online delivery in unprecedented numbers. Richardson, the daughter of the Marcus Books founders, is still operating the store every day. The contributions to Marcus Books are trickling in, but not fast enough. Hoping to boost support, the store organized an online stream that featured live readings from the poets Danez Smith, Daveed Diggs, Tongo Eisen-Martin, and others. More than people attended, raising Johnson said it was more than a fundraising event, offering a chance for the black community to connect. “There was a real alchemy that came together during it,” she says. Despite all of the challenges facing Marcus Books, Johnson says she is optimistic about the future of the store. It will find a way, she says: “Black bookstores have been making it work for years.” Click here for more information on Marcus Books Anniversary Fundraiser",963
4,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/15/i-wish-more-people-would-read-damon-runyon-short-stories,"amon Runyon was a Depression-era New York newspaperman who wrote, I think, some of the funniest short stories ever published. Yet he been only patchily in print in the UK over the last few decades, and inasmuch as most people know his work it’ll be through a vague sense of him as the writer behind the musical Guys and Dolls. I don’t denigrate that musical, but Runyon stories are their own thing. No musical can capture their special quality, for they are magical to the sentence level. I don’t think there anyone who wouldn’t benefit from reading him. He as funny as PG Wodehouse and, like Wodehouse, Runyon creates entirely his own idiom and entirely his own comic world. But unlike Wodehouse, who is always sunshine and innocence, Runyon world is wry and coloured with exquisite melancholy. His is a world of gangsters and hustlers and conmen, ill-starred professional gamblers and diners serving blue-plate specials and gefilte fish – all observed by a narrator “known to one and all as a guy who is just around”. The characters seldom ever have normal names: they are called things like Harry the Horse and Rusty Charley and Dream Street Rose. And this narrator speaks in an inimitable slang that is at once vernacular and almost comically circumlocutory, where a gun is a “roscoe” and money is “scratch” or “potatoes”, and women are “dolls” or “Judies” or “ever-loving wives”. If you are inconveniencing a citizen as he goes about his unlawful business there are such guys as will lay you plenty of six-to-two that you will receive a “bust in the snoot”. The famous thing about Runyon stories is that they are infallibly (or nearly infallibly; scholars scour the text for the handful of rare slips) narrated in the present tense. Hence the typically talky opening of The Snatching of Bookie Bob: Now it comes on the spring of after a long hard winter, and times are very tough indeed, what with the stock market going all to pieces, and banks busting right and left, and the law getting very nasty about this and that, and one thing and another, and many citizens of this town are compelled to do the best they can. There is very little scratch anywhere and along Broadway many citizens are wearing their last year clothes and have practically nothing to bet on the races or anything else, and it is a condition that will touch anybody heart. When talking about Runyon, sooner or later all you want to do is quote him. Here, for instance, is a passage from The Hottest Guy in the World, in which Big Jule describes how he passed the time shooting rats for target practice while holed up in a barn: Well, sir,’ Jule says, ‘I keep score on myself one day, and I hit fifty rats hand running without a miss, which I claim makes me the champion rat shooter of the world with a forty-five automatic, although of course,’ he says, ‘if anybody wishes to challenge me to a rat shooting match I am willing to take them on for a side bet. I get so I can call my shots on the rats, and in fact several times I say to myself, I will hit this one in the right eye, and this one in the left eye, and it always turns out just as I say, although sometimes when you hit a rat with a forty-five up close it is not always possible to tell afterwards just where you hit him, because you seem to hit him all over. For belly laughs from darkness, you will struggle to beat Sense of Humor. And that streak of melancholy I mentioned? Man alive. Try The Lily of St Pierre. And not for nothing is the title of one of his best stories All Horse Players Die Broke. There are dozens of these stories, and the standard omnibus edition is called On Broadway (bundling the collections More Than Somewhat, Furthermore and Take It Easy). It in Penguin Modern Classics . Go get it. You won’t regret it.",686
5,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/25/got-150-hours-great-audiobooks-to-listen-to-on-lockdown,"or those staying at home during the pandemic, the entertainment options might soon run low. There are only so many podcasts released each week, and streaming TV shows and films for hours straight is no more practical than reading books all day, if one has to be moving around cooking, exercising, or preventing small children from maiming themselves with unexpected household objects. So perhaps the long-form audiobook deserves a top slot in the menu of, I’m sorry, quarantainment. This might be a good chance to catch up on classics from previous centuries. An unavoidable monument here – and already a recent bestseller on Scribd , which has just announced that all its books and audiobooks will be available free for days — is The Plague by Albert Camus . This is the tale of a small French-Algerian town cut off from the outside world after an outbreak of bubonic plague, which its citizens at first refuse to believe is a serious threat. The central character, a doctor, remarks that his fellow townspeople in this respect “were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words, they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn’t a thing made to man measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away.” Long celebrated as a masterful allegory of Nazi occupation, The Plague is also a story of qualified hope, as a kind of existential solidarity persists while the storm rages outside. Some British listeners might, however, find themselves irritated by the American-accented narration in the only audiobook edition, which has a certain amount of trouble with the French names, and opt instead for Daniel Defoe grisly yet also undespairing A Journal of the Plague Year as narrated in the reassuringly Beebish tones of Andrew Cullum. A more purely escapist experience might be the great epic of comfortable society in France. If there is an ultra-endurance champion among audiobook readers, it must be the late actor Neville Jason, who recorded every single word (there are more than a million) of Proust great novel sequence, In Search of Lost Time (or, in the Scott Moncrieff translation used for the audiobook, originally Remembrance of Things Past). It runs to hours, or a bit less than a couple of hours every day for weeks. At one point in the third volume, Proust narrator remarks: “It is illness that makes us recognise that we do not live in isolation but are chained to a being from a different realm, worlds apart from us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body.” The vagaries of this being from a different realm are the subject of Bill Bryson most recent book, narrated with his usual charm by the author himself. The Body is ideal for the audio format, being a warm and engaging tour through the amazing facts of human physiology, with plenty of “did you know?” moments to keep the household entertained. Did you know, for example, that scientists have determined that scratching your back gives the most long-lasting relief, but scratching your ankle brings the most pleasure? The more you learn about your body, the more of a miracle it seems, if you’re lucky enough to have one that is still more or less in working order, even if no pandemic is raging. At one point Bryson, who throughout assumes a rather portly audience, exhorts you to “get up and move around a little”. This is rather difficult if one is reading, and wants to continue reading, the print version, but it fine advice for the shut-in listener. More purely escapist comfort listening is the classic BBC dramatisation of all of John le Carré classic George Smiley books : nowadays the cold war represents a simpler, even cosier time in the popular imagination, and Smiley himself, an owlish wanderer through the world shades of grey, represents in some ways the kind of prime minister we are not allowed to have any more. He is played in this “full-cast audiobook” (jargon for, essentially, a repackaged radio drama) by the great Simon Russell Beale. And if that still proves a little too this-worldly, there are more fantastical options. Those who like their medieval fantasy nonsense with a side order of sarcastic wit and catchy songs will have been bereft once they’d finished bingeing on the first season of The Witcher, starring as the grey-ponytailed monster hunter. A diversion for the ears while fans wait for the second TV series are the audiobooks of the original novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. They begin with the gloriously titled Blood of Elves , which may recall the deathless comment of literary scholar Hugo Dyson, who was one of the “Inklings” to whom Tolkien used to read instalments of Lord of the Rings. On one such occasion, Dyson is said to have groaned: “Oh fuck, not another elf.” A serene attitude towards the undesired appearance of elves, as well as towards much else, was cultivated by the great Stoics of classical times, among them the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. His Meditations , read in suitably imperial manner by Duncan Steen, are more authentically inspiring than any modern “inspirational” memes – and often quite funny. “The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority,” he wrote, “but to avoid finding oneself among the ranks of the insane.” And remember: “The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall.” If, as a kind of exercise in meditating upon how things could be even worse, you wish to catch up on the latest expert thinking about alternative apocalypses, there is Stuart Russell excellent Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control , read by Raphael Corkhill. Russell, a pioneer in machine intelligence, here considers the increasingly fashionable subject of what to do if a superintelligent AI is created and then takes over the world – or rather, how to stop that from happening. He provides a vivid and clear history of computing, and explains the problems inherent in trying to “load” values into AI so as to prevent it from trying to destroy us. He concludes that trying to give it any values at all is a mug game. Instead, the AI should be taught a humble attention to humans’ wishes. Particularly apt at the moment, when Facebook is “accidentally” censoring reliable news while blithely enabling the transmission of misinformation , is Russell argument that we all have an inalienable right “to live in a largely true information environment”, the draconian enforcement of which cannot come soon enough. A celebrity reader, meanwhile, is often a powerful draw for an audiobook. Margaret Atwood dystopian The Handmaid Tale is available in editions read by Claire Danes or Elisabeth Moss, star of the TV series, while none other than Meryl Streep has recorded Nora Ephron Heartburn . And in case you have never got through, or started, Homer Odyssey , perhaps the existence of an audiobook of the Robert Fagles translation, read by Ian McKellen, will finally render the prospect irresistible. Most authors are not the ideal readers of their own work – and why should they be? Writing prose and being able to read aloud in such a way as to hold a listener attention are two entirely different skills that happen to coexist in one person only by pure coincidence. One delightful such coincidence is novelist Anne Enright, whose performance of her own widely admired new novel, Actress , brings out all the mischievous empathy of her writing. Perhaps it is something to do with being Irish, because Marian Keyes also reads her new book, Grown Ups , with a nicely understated wit. In a way, David Cameron is also the ideal reader of his own work, if only because you would feel sorry for anyone else who had to do it. For some light comic relief, it is possible to listen to the architect of Britain last disaster before the present one reading his own memoir, imaginatively entitled For the Record , as though carefully holding a quail egg in his mouth while insisting that the Brexit referendum he didn’t have to call was “necessary” and “inevitable”. From the somewhat rustic ambience of the recording, one may happily imagine him narrating it from his expensive wheeled shed in the Cotswolds , the kind of civilised retreat to which we might all wish we now had access.

8,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/04/midnight-sun-twilight-stephenie-meyer,"t requires a strange sort of skill to miss a phenomenon such as Twilight. The first instalment of Stephenie Meyer young adult series was published in when I was and ripe for an obsession with vampires and sexual repression. But I had recently fallen in love with a boy who read Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, and other funny books by men. I cringe now to think of it, but I followed his taste blindly, parroting his beliefs that Twilight was overrated, problematic rubbish, without reading it for myself. Of course, I came to learn how often all things beloved by teenage girls are dismissed, and I’ve never done it since – still, it took lockdown for me to finally read this contemporary classic. And while it is true Twilight has its issues, the books are addictive; so much so that Meyer internet-breaking announcement of a new Twilight book , Midnight Sun, on Monday had me preordering faster than a girl melting under the intense gaze of a sparkly vampire. Stephenie Meyer announces new Twilight book Midnight Sun When the lockdown started, friends and fellow authors Daisy Johnson, Sarvat Hasin and I established a book club to get us through. I despise the phrase “guilty pleasure”, but we wanted a book that was inviting, entertaining, familiar. When I offhandedly mentioned I’d never read Twilight, it was met with shock and indignation. Our reading fate was decided. Seeking companionship for my government-mandated walks, I downloaded the first audiobook, narrated by Ilyana Kadushin , thinking I would consume all hours in manageable chunks. Anyone who has read the four-book saga will know how foolish I was. Bella narrative is instantly immersive, capturing the all-consuming concerns of teenage life, albeit in the person of someone seemingly irresistible to all she meets, including the immortally sexy Edward. It is perfect wish-fulfilment, though the sorts of wishes no feminist should ever want granted. Bella trips through the novel as an object of desire, unintentionally becoming the flashpoint that reignites an ancient grudge. But Meyer is a brilliant storyteller, mastering pace, plot and sexual tension. It is erotic in a way Fifty Shades of Grey can only dream of. My self would have loved it, but my self loves it even more. If I’d have read Twilight half a lifetime ago, it would have only confirmed the worst of what I believed about relationships, gender and sexuality. Adams and Pratchett were kinder, more playful teachers. Now, I can plunge headlong into the Twilight books, admiring their strengths and laughing at their faults, alongside four (our number has grown to include my husband and a doctor of literature) of the most precious people in my life. Twilight was never part of my adolescence, but now it is an invaluable part of my lockdown story. Twilight has endured for half my life , so you don’t need me to tell you why there was hysteria when Meyer announced a new title, having previously claimed to have no intention of returning to the franchise. But it is no surprise to me the lure was too strong. Authors live with their characters long beyond the final pages. With legions of readers hungry for more, I am glad Meyer relented. We need joy and escape right now. With Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins also revisiting her own bestselling series with a prequel, The Ballad of Snakes and Songbirds , coming out this month, we have two YA authors indulging the teen fantasies of a generation of twentysomethings, and potentially igniting those of a whole new generation. The decisions to add prequels to these female-led narratives through male characters is especially interesting; I do wonder if we will miss Bella and Katniss, while learning more about the men they love and hate. If you are on the fence, I can absolutely recommend you join the hype. Hopefully the emergence of YA culture as a world-dominating phenomena means people will stop dismissing books enjoyed by teenage girls out of hand. And if you, too, missed out on this epic of the YA canon, Midnight Sun is out in August – there still time to get some friends together for a readalong.

9,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months,"or centuries western culture has been permeated by the idea that humans are selfish creatures. That cynical image of humanity has been proclaimed in films and novels, history books and scientific research. But in the last years, something extraordinary has happened. Scientists from all over the world have switched to a more hopeful view of mankind. This development is still so young that researchers in different fields often don’t even know about each other. When I started writing a book about this more hopeful view, I knew there was one story I would have to address. It takes place on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific. A plane has just gone down. The only survivors are some British schoolboys, who can’t believe their good fortune. Nothing but beach, shells and water for miles. And better yet: no grownups. On the very first day, the boys institute a democracy of sorts. One boy, Ralph, is elected to be the group leader. Athletic, charismatic and handsome, his game plan is simple: Have fun. Survive. Make smoke signals for passing ships. Number one is a success. The others? Not so much. The boys are more interested in feasting and frolicking than in tending the fire. Before long, they have begun painting their faces. Casting off their clothes. And they develop overpowering urges – to pinch, to kick, to bite. By the time a British naval officer comes ashore, the island is a smouldering wasteland. Three of the children are dead. “I should have thought,” the officer says, “that a pack of British boys would have been able to put up a better show than that.” At this, Ralph bursts into tears. “Ralph wept for the end of innocence,” we read, and for “the darkness of man heart”. Golding had a masterful ability to portray the darkest depths of mankind This story never happened. An English schoolmaster, William Golding , made up this story in – his novel Lord of the Flies would sell tens of millions of copies, be translated into more than languages and hailed as one of the classics of the century. In hindsight, the secret to the book success is clear. Golding had a masterful ability to portray the darkest depths of mankind. Of course, he had the zeitgeist of the on his side, when a new generation was questioning its parents about the atrocities of the second world war. Had Auschwitz been an anomaly, they wanted to know, or is there a Nazi hiding in each of us? I first read Lord of the Flies as a teenager. I remember feeling disillusioned afterwards, but not for a second did I think to doubt Golding view of human nature. That didn’t happen until years later when I began delving into the author life. I learned what an unhappy individual he had been: an alcoholic, prone to depression. “I have always understood the Nazis,” Golding confessed, “because I am of that sort by nature.” And it was “partly out of that sad self-knowledge” that he wrote Lord of the Flies . I began to wonder: had anyone ever studied what real children would do if they found themselves alone on a deserted island? I wrote an article on the subject, in which I compared Lord of the Flies to modern scientific insights and concluded that, in all probability, kids would act very differently. Readers responded sceptically. All my examples concerned kids at home, at school, or at summer camp. Thus began my quest for a real-life Lord of the Flies . After trawling the web for a while, I came across an obscure blog that told an arresting story: “One day, in six boys set out from Tonga on a fishing trip ... Caught in a huge storm, the boys were shipwrecked on a deserted island. What do they do, this little tribe? They made a pact never to quarrel.” Rutger Bregman: 'Our secret superpower is our ability to cooperate' The article did not provide any sources. But sometimes all it takes is a stroke of luck. Sifting through a newspaper archive one day, I typed a year incorrectly and there it was. The reference to turned out to have been a typo. In the October edition of Australian newspaper The Age, a headline jumped out at me: “Sunday showing for Tongan castaways”. The story concerned six boys who had been found three weeks earlier on a rocky islet south of Tonga, an island group in the Pacific Ocean. The boys had been rescued by an Australian sea captain after being marooned on the island of ‘Ata for more than a year. According to the article, the captain had even got a television station to film a re-enactment of the boys’ adventure. I was bursting with questions. Were the boys still alive? And could I find the television footage? Most importantly, though, I had a lead: the captain name was Peter Warner. When I searched for him, I had another stroke of luck. In a recent issue of a tiny local paper from Mackay, Australia, I came across the headline: “Mates share bond”. Printed alongside was a small photograph of two men, smiling, one with his arm slung around the other. The article began: “Deep in a banana plantation at Tullera, near Lismore, sit an unlikely pair of mates ... The elder is years old, the son of a wealthy industrialist. The younger, was, literally, a child of nature.” Their names? Peter Warner and Mano Totau. And where had they met? On a deserted island. My wife Maartje and I rented a car in Brisbane and some three hours later arrived at our destination, a spot in the middle of nowhere that stumped Google Maps. Yet there he was, sitting out in front of a low-slung house off the dirt road: the man who rescued six lost boys years ago, Captain Peter Warner. Peter was the youngest son of Arthur Warner, once one of the richest and most powerful men in Australia. Back in the Arthur ruled over a vast empire called Electronic Industries, which dominated the country radio market at the time. Peter was groomed to follow in his father footsteps. Instead, at the age of he ran away to sea in search of adventure and spent the next few years sailing from Hong Kong to Stockholm, Shanghai to St Petersburg. When he finally returned five years later, the prodigal son proudly presented his father with a Swedish captain certificate. Unimpressed, Warner Sr demanded his son learn a useful profession. “What easiest?” Peter asked. “Accountancy,” Arthur lied. Peter went to work for his father company, yet the sea still beckoned, and whenever he could he went to Tasmania, where he kept his own fishing fleet. It was this that brought him to Tonga in the winter of On the way home he took a little detour and that when he saw it: a minuscule island in the azure sea, ‘Ata. The island had been inhabited once, until one dark day in when a slave ship appeared on the horizon and sailed off with the natives. Since then, ‘Ata had been deserted – cursed and forgotten. It didn’t take long for the first boy to reach the boat. 'My name is Stephen,' he cried. 'We've been here months.' But Peter noticed something odd. Peering through his binoculars, he saw burned patches on the green cliffs. “In the tropics it unusual for fires to start spontaneously,” he told us, a half century later. Then he saw a boy. Naked. Hair down to his shoulders. This wild creature leaped from the cliffside and plunged into the water. Suddenly more boys followed, screaming at the top of their lungs. It didn’t take long for the first boy to reach the boat. “My name is Stephen,” he cried in perfect English. “There are six of us and we reckon we’ve been here months.” The boys, once aboard, claimed they were students at a boarding school in Nuku‘alofa, the Tongan capital. Sick of school meals, they had decided to take a fishing boat out one day, only to get caught in a storm. Likely story, Peter thought. Using his two-way radio, he called in to Nuku‘alofa. “I’ve got six kids here,” he told the operator. “Stand by,” came the response. Twenty minutes ticked by. (As Peter tells this part of the story, he gets a little misty-eyed.) Finally, a very tearful operator came on the radio, and said: “You found them! These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it them, this is a miracle!” In the months that followed I tried to reconstruct as precisely as possible what had happened on ‘Ata. Peter memory turned out to be excellent. Even at the age of everything he recounted was consistent with my foremost other source, Mano, years old at the time and now pushing who lived just a few hours’ drive from him. The real Lord of the Flies , Mano told us, began in June The protagonists were six boys – Sione, Stephen, Kolo, David, Luke and Mano – all pupils at a strict Catholic boarding school in Nuku‘alofa. The oldest was the youngest and they had one main thing in common: they were bored witless. So they came up with a plan to escape: to Fiji, some miles away, or even all the way to New Zealand. There was only one obstacle. None of them owned a boat, so they decided to “borrow” one from Mr Taniela Uhila, a fisherman they all disliked. The boys took little time to prepare for the voyage. Two sacks of bananas, a few coconuts and a small gas burner were all the supplies they packed. It didn’t occur to any of them to bring a map, let alone a compass. The boys had set up a commune with food garden, gym, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire No one noticed the small craft leaving the harbour that evening. Skies were fair; only a mild breeze ruffled the calm sea. But that night the boys made a grave error. They fell asleep. A few hours later they awoke to water crashing down over their heads. It was dark. They hoisted the sail, which the wind promptly tore to shreds. Next to break was the rudder. “We drifted for eight days,” Mano told me. “Without food. Without water.” The boys tried catching fish. They managed to collect some rainwater in hollowed-out coconut shells and shared it equally between them, each taking a sip in the morning and another in the evening. Then, on the eighth day, they spied a miracle on the horizon. A small island, to be precise. Not a tropical paradise with waving palm trees and sandy beaches, but a hulking mass of rock, jutting up more than a thousand feet out of the ocean. These days, ‘Ata is considered uninhabitable. But “by the time we arrived,” Captain Warner wrote in his memoirs, “the boys had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade and much determination.” While the boys in Lord of the Flies come to blows over the fire, those in this real-life version tended their flame so it never went out, for more than a year. The kids agreed to work in teams of two, drawing up a strict roster for garden, kitchen and guard duty. Sometimes they quarrelled, but whenever that happened they solved it by imposing a time-out. Their days began and ended with song and prayer. Kolo fashioned a makeshift guitar from a piece of driftwood, half a coconut shell and six steel wires salvaged from their wrecked boat – an instrument Peter has kept all these years – and played it to help lift their spirits. And their spirits needed lifting. All summer long it hardly rained, driving the boys frantic with thirst. They tried constructing a raft in order to leave the island, but it fell apart in the crashing surf. Worst of all, Stephen slipped one day, fell off a cliff and broke his leg. The other boys picked their way down after him and then helped him back up to the top. They set his leg using sticks and leaves. “Don’t worry,” Sione joked. “We’ll do your work, while you lie there like King Taufa‘ahau Tupou himself!” They survived initially on fish, coconuts, tame birds (they drank the blood as well as eating the meat); seabird eggs were sucked dry. Later, when they got to the top of the island, they found an ancient volcanic crater, where people had lived a century before. There the boys discovered wild taro, bananas and chickens (which had been reproducing for the years since the last Tongans had left). When they arrived home, they found the police waiting to meet them. They were arrested and thrown in jail They were finally rescued on Sunday September The local physician later expressed astonishment at their muscled physiques and Stephen perfectly healed leg. But this wasn’t the end of the boys’ little adventure, because, when they arrived back in Nuku‘alofa police boarded Peter boat, arrested the boys and threw them in jail. Mr Taniela Uhila, whose sailing boat the boys had “borrowed” months earlier, was still furious, and he’d decided to press charges. Fortunately for the boys, Peter came up with a plan. It occurred to him that the story of their shipwreck was perfect Hollywood material. And being his father corporate accountant, Peter managed the company film rights and knew people in TV. So from Tonga, he called up the manager of Channel in Sydney. “You can have the Australian rights,” he told them. “Give me the world rights.” Next, Peter paid Mr Uhila for his old boat, and got the boys released on condition that they would cooperate with the movie. A few days later, a team from Channel arrived. The 'real Lord of the Flies': a survivor story of shipwreck and salvation The mood when the boys returned to their families in Tonga was jubilant. Almost the entire island of Haʻafeva – population – had turned out to welcome them home. Peter was proclaimed a national hero. Soon he received a message from King Taufa‘ahau Tupou IV himself, inviting the captain for an audience. “Thank you for rescuing six of my subjects,” His Royal Highness said. “Now, is there anything I can do for you?” The captain didn’t have to think long. “Yes! I would like to trap lobster in these waters and start a business here.” The king consented. Peter returned to Sydney, resigned from his father company and commissioned a new ship. Then he had the six boys brought over and granted them the thing that had started it all: an opportunity to see the world beyond Tonga. He hired them as the crew of his new fishing boat. While the boys of ‘Ata have been consigned to obscurity, Golding book is still widely read. Media historians even credit him as being the unwitting originator of one of the most popular entertainment genres on television today: reality TV. “I read and reread Lord of the Flies ,” divulged the creator of hit series Survivor in an interview. It time we told a different kind of story. The real Lord of the Flies is a tale of friendship and loyalty; one that illustrates how much stronger we are if we can lean on each other. After my wife took Peter picture, he turned to a cabinet and rummaged around for a bit, then drew out a heavy stack of papers that he laid in my hands. His memoirs, he explained, written for his children and grandchildren. I looked down at the first page. “Life has taught me a great deal,” it began, “including the lesson that you should always look for what is good and positive in people.” This is an adapted excerpt from Rutger Bregman Humankind, translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore. A live streamed Q&amp;A with Bregman and Owen Jones takes place at on May This article was amended on May to remove a reference to William Golding beating his children. The line was based on Golding own account of a pillow fight with his four-year-old son in which he described how he had enjoyed hitting the boy and “stopped when [my son] was on the verge of tears”. Golding daughter has said ( see letter ) that their father never beat or smacked them.",2773
10,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/10/linda-bostrom-knausgard-i-would-like-to-be-seen-as-a-person-and-author-in-my-own-right,"Linda Boström Knausgård is sitting at a corner table in a London cafe a few days before lockdown. Slender, pale and serious in a high-necked cream blouse, she looks like a character in an Ibsen play. This is apt in more ways than one, for as hundreds of thousands of readers know from the books written by her ex-husband, Boström life has been as full of dark, domestic and psychological drama as any of her fellow Scandinavian heroines. But the Swedish poet and author is here to tell me that she is through with being a character in someone else novels. “I am finding my own language and it feels good. I feel free,” she says. The ex-husband in question is Karl Ove Knausgå rd , the Norwegian writer whose six-part series of autobiographical novels, My Struggle , became a worldwide literary sensation over the past decade. As well as documenting his own daily life in minute detail – from the kind of cigarettes he smokes to the grim alcoholic death of his father – the books laid bare Boström lowest and most intimate moments. When we meet, I feel I already know more about her than I do about some of my closest friends. I know about her attempted suicide in her and that she is bipolar, like her father. I know about her struggles with the illness that led to the breakdown described by Knausgård in the final book in his series. I even know about their squabbles over shopping and childcare and that she is terrible at housework. “She always wanted something else, never did anything to improve things, just moaned, moaned, moaned,” Knausgård wrote, provoking one reviewer to wonder: “What kind of person would publish such a thing about his wife?” At the time, although some of his wider family cut him off completely, Boström stood by Knausgård and defended his freedom to write whatever he wished. How does she feel now, three years on from their divorce? “I have made my peace with the books now but in reality I was so angry about what he wrote,” she says. “As a writer, I respect his right to use his own life as material and, objectively, I thought the books were very good. But on a personal level I was really angry about the way he looked at me. His view of me was so limited, he saw only what he wanted to see. It was as if he didn’t know me at all. Reading it felt like suffering a loss. Now I just wonder if maybe he one of these male writers that can’t really write about women.” As a teenager in the Boström dreamed of becoming an actress like her mother, Ingrid Boström, who was a celebrated name in Swedish theatre at the time. She was devastated when she failed to get into acting school but then discovered she had won a place at a leading writing school instead. “It felt like my destiny,” she says. She was already making her name as an author when she first met Knausgård in at a writers’ workshop. Boström went on to publish some short stories and a novel, The Helios Disaster , during the early part of their marriage. But four children and her illness – plus the storm of attention and controversy that raged around Knausgård – stalled her career. Now she has written two novels in quick succession: Welcome to America , the sparse, shocking story of a young girl who refuses to speak, loosely based on her own childhood, which was awarded Sweden prestigious August prize, and the more openly autobiographical October Child . Among much else, the latter book, published last autumn in Sweden , gives her take on events towards the end of the marriage to Knausgård. Does it feel good to be able to put her own spin on things for a change? For instance, Knausgård wrote that the couple agreed to separate; in October Child, Boström says it was his decision. “Settling scores was not really my intention. What I set out to do was write a good book. I wasn’t interested in giving my point of view on what Karl Ove wrote about,” she says. “I found myself one day just writing the first pages and as I wrote I found this very raw language of my own, this sort of dark humour, and also this horror. But it wasn’t supposed to be a diary of the end of our marriage.” Much of October Child is set in the psychiatric institution Boström entered after her breakdown, where she stayed on and off for the next four years. It describes the brutal electric shock therapy that she underwent as her marriage was ending. At that point, she had become ill enough that the decision to undergo this “horrific” treatment was forced upon her. She has described it since as a form of abuse. “The doctors told me it would be OK, that it was like rebooting a computer,” she says. “But they didn’t really know. They didn’t have the language to describe it.” Boström believes she has lost many of her memories as a result. “Some have returned but by no means all. Writing the book helped with that, though,” she says. Boström first discovered she was bipolar at after a troubled childhood overshadowed by her father condition. He was an alcoholic as well as bipolar and his behaviour was unpredictable. For much of the time growing up, she remembers feeling she should be very quiet. “My mother divorced my father when I was very young, so she was all I had,” she says. “I felt I needed to look after her and be as little problem as possible so she would stay around. I felt like I could never speak my mind – I had to keep quiet.” There were few boundaries as to when her father could visit Boström and her brother. Often, he would turn up in the evenings, while her mother was at the theatre. “When he was doing well, he could be lovely,” she says. “But he was a potent threat when he wasn’t. I found him very frightening during those times.” In Welcome to America , Ellen father forces her to sit in one place all night, listening to him sing a favourite song, until she wets herself. “That happened in real life,” Boström says. As a consequence, most of her childhood evenings were spent watching her mother rehearse or perform at the theatre. “That was the safest spot. Nothing could happen there. I knew if he came into the theatre he would be stopped. At home, he could climb up the drainpipe and break in, which he often did. My mother never called the police or social services. She didn’t want anyone outside the family to be involved,” Boström says. How did she feel when she was diagnosed with the same illness that had afflicted her father? “I felt horror, complete and utter horror,” she says. “Because I knew what was in store for me. When you are up you don’t sleep. Ideas come to you very fast and you want to do all these strange things you don’t normally do. You walk in the city all day and all night. I would think I was making new friends everywhere and some of them weren’t nice at all. Manic people can seem very charming. If you met me when I was up, you would probably think I was in a good place. It feels like a good place at the time but you know from experience that it not. And that you’re going to crash down. It is a life sentence I live with.” For now, however, life is good for Boström, or as good as it can be in the time of Both her books have been much praised in Sweden and October Child will be published here and in the US next spring. She moved to London at the start of this year to be near her children, aged six to who live in the city with their father and his new partner, a publishing executive. Boström new home is a house in a leafy suburb near the Thames. What does she hope for from the move? “Let see what happens,” she says. “It a fresh start. Most of all I would like to be seen as a person and an author in my own right. For such a long time, when people saw me they would think, oh yeah, Karl Ove, and, oh yeah, bipolar. I’d like that to change.” Welcome to America by Linda Boström Knausgård is published by World Editions To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com . Free UK p&amp;p over",1465
11,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/richard-ford,"Richard Ford, is a novelist whose particular feat has been to translate failure into literary success: he writes about human beings and their disappointments with unfailing insight and, while he never mocks his characters, is keenly aware of the absurdity involved in being alive. His best-known novels are about Frank B ascombe , sportswriter turned real estate agent. His novel Independence Day won the Pulitzer prize in He lives in Maine, teaches English at Columbia and his new collection of short stories, Sorry for Your Trouble , is exemplary in its nuanced understanding of the relationships between men and women. Your stories explore choice and the rogue ways life behaves. Do people have a choice about who they fall in love with? And what part does luck play? I think about both these questions. I was the luckiest man in the world when I met Kristina back in – I’ve been married to the same girl for years. Yet throughout that long period, you choose all over again. I used to tell Kristina, “I choose to be married to you every day.” You write about moments that “come from nowhere” in which life is “re framed.” What were your own moments? In I had to make a decision to tear my whole apparatus down and start my writing life again. The first books I’d written were OK but I had to devise a way of getting more of what I knew into what I was writing. I knew I wasn’t smart enough – although I was dogged enough – to be a great writer unless I could bring everything I had to the page every single day. I devised draconian clerical procedures. I immersed myself in raw material. I slowed everything down. It worked out better. Are you more comfortable with short stories? Is the commitment of a novel too much of a good – or long – thing? No – I’m writing a novel at the moment. Short stories are easier because they are shorter but are acutely demanding. Pulling together a collection of fundamentally disparate stories which you’d also like to be cohesive is more trying than writing a novel. You’ve lived in many places in the US . Is restlessness a novelist prerogative? And why did you swap New Orleans for Maine? I grew up in Jackson, Mississippi – the backside of the moon – and wanted to get away and see America. Fortunately, Kristina was an air-force child and had lived all over the US so was up for it. I moved to Maine because of my wife job which drove me crazy. She was director of city planning in New Orleans. I just told her, I know this is the job of your lifetime and I know you really want to keep it but I have to get out. So first, I went to Paris and then I came back and went to Maine. I had never been to Maine before. The making of ourselves is how we go beyond disappointments You’ve written about real estate with such panache… how would you describe your house in Maine if you were trying to sell it to me? Refurbished Cape Cod, yards from the ocean. Six outbuildings, a guesthouse, four acres – a mini estate. I’d add: “Why you’re not already living in it is a mystery.” When I walked into this house, after six months of looking, I picked up the phone, called my wife and said: “Get up here right now. This house won’t be on the market tomorrow.” I showed her the house and she loved it. I said: “Please come up here and live with me.” And after four years, she did. Does getting older bring freedom? It brings the freedom of having seen a lot of things and survived them. Particularly other people failure to understand. It confers veteranship on you; it makes things a bit easier. I’m transgressive by nature but feel bad when I transgress. A guy at the supermarket yesterday got very close to me without wearing a mask. I turned to him and said: “Don’t you like me? Are you trying to kill me? Get the hell away.” Then I felt bad. I don’t exercise my freedoms with alacrity. How often do you think about death and in what spirit? The novel I’m writing is about death and dying and is a comedy. Frank Bascombe is dying of a fatal disease… It called Be Mine . I’ll tell you one thing I’ve thought about death. It simple-minded in a way. But at I’ve seen a lot of my friends “transition” and am shocked by how little gets left behind. Leaving aside the question of legacy, there will be some residue in the hearts and minds of others that lingers but I find there is so much less than I’d have liked. Why the fascination with Irishness in your book? My father family was Irish. I’m American. I’m not pretending to be an Irishman. But I taught at Trinity College Dublin and it was wonderful. I travelled round, picked up bits of stuff to put in my notebook. At some point, I thought I could use these to make a suite of stories. But I wasn’t trying to get to the heart of Ireland. The stories, if they’re any good, could equally have been set in Latvia. Are most people disappointed with their lives? Disappointments come to everybody willy-nilly. The making of ourselves is how we go beyond it. What do you read for sheer pleasure? I’m such a slow reader, I read to learn. I was raised a Presbyterian: you have to decide the hard things are the fun things. I started War and Peace during lockdown because it is one of those monolithic books you dare not undertake for the disappointment it would bring were you not to finish it. It is completely enrapturing… Is there any author or book you always return to? The Movie goer by Walker Percy, Something Happened by Joseph Heller, A Fan Notes by Frederick Exley. And Elizabeth Bowen The House in Paris . What sort of reader were you as a child? Dyslexic. I am less dyslexic now because, in this perverse way, I’ve developed a writing and reading life.

12,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/08/mem-fox-on-fear-creativity-and-covid-19-what-if-i-die-with-the-story-unfinished,"n some ways, life for Mem Fox under coronavirus is not terribly different from life before the pandemic. It largely “same, same”, the children author says. “But there is one difference, and that terror.” She was sick last year, in hospital for eight days with paraflu. She was too weak to read. She couldn’t hold a book. Hospital staff would be kitted out in PPE when treating her, and visitors needed to keep their distance. If she took a phone call from a friend, she would need three hours to recover. She just couldn’t breathe. She did recover. But as coronavirus casts a pall over all things, she is aware she is in the highest level of the danger zone. Recently ill, years old and a severe asthmatic. She feels the terror in her body – something like cold sweats and slight panic attacks. She wonders sometimes whether she will survive the coming winter. But within that terror – and boredom, as she lay in her hospital bed unable even to queue up podcasts – she began to write a story in her head. Job losses, cancelled tours, delayed releases: the Australian books industry grapples with 'huge shock' “Day after day I would write it, rethink certain phases then rewrite,” Fox tells Guardian Australia. As she got better, she asked her husband tobuy a pad of yellow paper, a rubber, a sharpener and six pencils. “The lead is so soft, it lovely to write with.” One day, a specialist came into her room to find Fox on a bed covered with yellow pages of drafting, the right sleeve of her nightie dirty from rubber crumbs. She was appalled to see Fox working but the author replied that, actually, she was in a state of zen. The forced stillness had brought her to another planet. She worked through to draft putting the story down before the end of the year. And then she thought: “Oh my God, what if I die with that story unfinished?” So she militantly set aside time to work on it further. “And because I had the terror and the tension, I was able to be creative again. I finished it.” The book has been accepted but it is unlikely to be published until Fox had two thoughts: one, that it may be posthumous but at least it got done. The second was that would mark the anniversary of her first book, Possum Magic – one of the best-loved in Australian children literature. Five years later you’re still writing a book of words ... every single word has to be in the right place Mem Fox Fox mother would disapprove of her “skiting” but the author has been wondering why it is she has been so successful. Not every book has been a bestseller, but enough of them have found places in the homes and languages of children in Australia and beyond. The difference, she has decided, is a sense of rhythm. “I can’t bring it down to anything else.” Children books are for reading aloud. Not a single word, not a beat, can be off-kilter. Koala Lou took two years and drafts to complete. Her latest book, The Tiny Star, took five years. “The problem is that you get the idea, you know the story, maybe you’ve got the characters. Putting those things together in a first draft, that simple,” she says. “But five years later you’re still writing a book of words or something. Because, in [The Tiny Star] in particular, every single word had to be in the right place. You couldn’t have a syllable in the wrong place.” There is another component, she thinks, that has rendered her stories so popular. “It also understanding that children are intelligent, and that they’ve got a sense of humour, and they have deeply felt emotions, even at a young age,” she says. “They are super human beings, little kids.” And as someone who has been talking to children for generations, what does Fox think of childhood under coronavirus? “The positive side of it is massive,” she says. “It the weirdest thing.” While the physical side of restrictions can be hard for young children, Fox finds cause for much hope – even enjoyment – in the upheaval. Families spending entire days together, with fathers, particularly, spending much more time at home. No scuttling, pinball-like, between scheduled activities. In some ways, for the lucky families, it a gift. “I think that children must have been able to find a sense of calm,” she says. “Everything cancelled. There no sport. There no outside school activity. There no urgency any more. It must be wonderful for them.” The whole world in a bedroom: seven of the most imaginative picture books for lockdown life The lockdown, says the former associate professor of literary studies, is a huge opportunity for literacy. Fox defends teachers but is no fan of contemporary literacy teaching. And while not all children are or will be read to, for those who are, she says, this lockdown could mean they read with their loved ones far more than in the past. “This is an inoculation against illiteracy!” And then there the magic. At the end of the day, after whatever calm or chaos has preceded it, something happens, she says, when an adult sits down with a child to read. “You almost see the changing shape of the child when those familiar words begin.” And not just for the child: “The balloon of tension in a parent just goes away. It just goes down to nothing. It magical.” And if coronavirus means there are more moments like that, in more households, she says, “It not all been bad.”",950
13,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/they-were-literally-about-to-turn-me-off-and-on-again-robert-webb-on-his-brush-with-mortality,"here are moments when your life changes over the length of a single word. For example, you might remember that particular time you heard the word “pregnant”. Or maybe “divorce” or “congratulations” or “guilty”. And maybe you remember the silence that followed and how it had a new weight to it. As if the silence were saying: “Look, if I’m expected to follow words like that, I’m going to need a bit more respect around here.” That how it was for me last October. I didn’t get to choose my life-changing word, of course. If I had, I doubt I would have gone with “prolapse”. “It looks like a prolapse.” “Yes, the valve is prolapsed and there severe regurgitation.” “Due to the prolapse. All right, Mr Webb? Nearly done.” An echocardiogram – an ultrasound of the heart – is in progress. The setting is a hospital and the time is that far-off era when we imagined hospitals to be places full of sick people having their own bespoke emergencies rather than sick people having one national emergency. More normal times, you might say – when we had the spare attention to be interested in all the deadly medical conditions that you can’t get from a doorknob. It was certainly when I thought deadly medical conditions only happened to other people. Like I say, normal times. So in the hospital I’m lying on my side, topless and facing the wall with my left arm crooked under my head. It how I was asked to lie here, but the position now feels oddly louche, as if I’m a life model and the portrait under construction is called Writer Is Quietly Relieved He Got the Novel Finished Because “Prolapse” Doesn’t Sound Like Something That Meant to Happen Inside Hearts. Two days earlier, I’d left the rehearsal room of the sitcom Back to go for a routine cast medical. A GP had put a stethoscope on my heart, pulled a face and referred me to the cardiologist. It true to say I had sauntered into middle age while still treating my body like a skip The heart doctor has a distinctive handshake, offered palm up with the fingers splayed. It looks like an apology and as soon as I sit down it becomes clear why he sorry. “I’m not saying you’re going to have a heart attack in the next fortnight,” he says slowly. OK, well that… good. “But if the problem isn’t addressed, then in the next two or four or six months… this heart will fail.” There it is again, another word that warps the silence around it. “Fail”. As in: “epic heart fail”. It turns out that my heart has a prolapsed mitral valve. With every heartbeat, more than half the blood that should be pushed out of the left ventricle to do its thing around my body is flowing backwards into the left atrium. It means that the heart has had to work much harder than it should, growing and remodelling to keep the show on the road. This seems to have been going on for years. And now – time up. “Unfortunately, valve repair isn’t something we can do with pills,” he says and I feel like I’ve gone very still. He puts it rather more gently than this but I gather there’ll be none of this newfangled noninvasive keyhole nonsense either. That for people who need to avoid a big old slash in the chest and their breastbone getting sawn in half and clamped open for hours. The snowflakes. No, it seems that if like me you’re a cardiac surgery virgin then there really no excuse not to do this the old-fashioned way: the method that maximises the chances of a good outcome because the surgeon can – as it was explained to me by another doctor – “see what the hell he doing”. Right. That’ll be lifesaving open-heart surgery for me then. Fine. “It going to be interesting to see how I react to this,” I think as I make my way urgently to the pub. Mitral valve failure arises from a birth defect, and I was glad this was not “my fault”. And if it had been, I would surely have been advised not to think in terms of blame, and after a show of reluctance I would have agreed. But it true to say that I had sauntered into middle age while still treating my body like a skip, and of all the people who might find a brush with mortality useful, I was higher up the list than you might think. Hijacked by addiction at some point in the late my addled brain was on permanent lookout for the right “watershed”: no more cigarettes after this birthday, no more wine after this breakfast etc. Well, I’d got my watershed all right. You can’t operate on a beating heart – they were literally about to turn me off and on again. Watershed that , ducky. My mood during the weeks before the operation was the kind of hysterical calm you’d expect from someone who just made an appointment to get hit by a lorry. I wandered quietly around the house downloading audiobooks and trying not to have a heart attack. There wasn’t much work to do because I’d already finished editing Come Again , a novel I couldn’t help notice featured a fortysomething male who has just died from an illness that had been lurking unseen for years. His widow, Kate, finds herself back in and meets him when he still an annoying young man. She thinks she there to warn him. I like the idea my imagination had been trying to tell me something about my dodgy ticker. Thanks, imagination. Try something less subtle next time, would you? The story follows our heroine as she tries to do what many of us are attempting right now – she has to reconcile the lost past with the new present. In other words, she in mourning. I remember talking to the friendly anaesthetist and the gurgling sound quite close to my ear as he pushed the anaesthetic through the cannula in my neck. Then time travel. Then my wife, Abbie, handing me a cup with a straw and history greatest ever sip of cold water. And I remember the relief that comes from knowing that it done. Ahead of me: six nights in hospital, three weeks before I could lift a kettle, four months before I was fit for work, a year of beta blockers to give my heart time to heal… but it was done. There a long, thin vertical scar on my chest which bulges at each end, like the spaceship in A Space Odyssey The first months of recovery felt like a light preview of old age, and I spent the winter minding my step. The dog-walkers smiled at me. Maybe they could tell I was now scared of dogs. Dogs, icy pavements and unpredictable toddlers – before coronavirus I was already giving everyone plenty of room. A daily walk, working from home and avoiding pubs – I’ve been doing all this since October. What else? Trying to be nicer on social media, limiting my contact with the news, turning inwards. To be fair, it possible that I’m confusing “grappling with the fragility of life and the ordinariness of death” with “being sober”. Either way, the world feels new. Mainly I’m overtaken by gratitude. I was insanely lucky to get this over with before the virus struck, and my mended heart goes out to all those left waiting for treatment. I’m grateful for the Back medical and to all the doctors and nurses, the ones we applaud on our doorstep every week and perhaps always should have. I wrote a book about someone getting a second chance and I thought at the time it was a work of fiction. I feel re-blessed by my children. I thank what higher will brought me to a wife like Abbie. There a thin, seven-inch vertical scar in the middle of my chest which slightly bulges at each end, like the spaceship in A Space Odyssey . Just below are three dots which mark where three tubes came out of my abdomen. The dots look like an ellipsis and remind me that you never know what around the corner… Like most privileges, good health prefers to go unnoticed. The scars are beginning to fade and my life would be returning to normal by now if the times allowed. Assuming I’m spared by the plague and get the chance, one day there will be another room and another word that stops the show: “tumour” or “metastasised” or “sheer weight of that piano”. And it will be frightening, of course, but not mysterious. It will be a day like today. For a while back there, the cliche was safe in my hands. I really did stop to smell the blossom in the trees; I listened to the songs of birds and admired the daffodils in all their trembling grace. No one can be permanently enthralled, but I won’t forget the moment when life got too close. Come Again is published by Canongate",1533
14,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/philippe-sands-when-the-virus-crisis-is-over-nationalism-could-be-rampant,"hilippe Sands, is a professor of law at University College London and a barrister. He appears regularly before the international courts: last year he acted for the prosecution in the Rohingya genocide case at The Hague. His memoir, East West Street , won the Baillie Gifford prize. His new book, The Ratline , is about an Austrian Nazi, Otto von Wächter, and his wife, Charlotte, who helped him to evade justice when he went on the run in How is The Ratline connected to East West Street ? In I went to Lviv, in Ukraine, to give a lecture. That led to East West Street . It was supposed to be about my grandfather, Leon, who grew up there, and Hersch Lauterpacht and Rafael Lemkin [also from Lviv], the jurists who put the terms “crimes against humanity” and “genocide” into international law. But then Hans Frank came into it: the governor of German-occupied Poland, who was hanged at Nuremberg. Following a speech he gave in Lviv, the Jews of the region known as Galicia [Lviv was its capital] were exterminated. I came across a book by Frank son, Niklas. We met and became friends, and he introduced me to Horst, the son of Otto von Wächter, who was the Nazi governor of Lviv from and Frank deputy. Niklas hates his father; Horst doesn’t. I made a documentary about them, then a podcast about Otto, and now this book . The Ratline is very different from East West Street , isn’t it? The reader is horrified, but also gripped; at times, it like a thriller. Yes, and that was the source of bother. I’m really fond of Horst, but he also upsets me [by defending Otto]. I would think: why am I putting myself through this? Then there Charlotte. She fascinates me. She a Nazi, but what she does for Otto is incredible; there something almost beautiful about it. Until May, he pulling all the strings – then, with one snap of a finger, the power balance is changed. He needs her absolutely. He did monstrous things, but he was also a father, a lover, a husband, a highly cultured man How has Horst reacted to The Ratline ? He hasn’t read it yet. He’ll be upset. But other Von Wächters have already come out of the woodwork. One begged me not to publish; another asked me to forgive Otto. A book like this is worrying to them in terms of their reputation, particularly in the context of Austria, which has not come to terms with the war as Germany has. They think some things are best not talked about. What remarkable is the way that you show Otto in the round. Yes. It unhelpful to describe these men as monsters. He did monstrous things, but he was also a father, a lover, a husband, a highly cultured man. One scene that stays with me is in when the worst killing is going on. At the weekend, he going boating. How do you do it? How do you round people up and murder them, then go home and, say, listen to an opera? This is the question, to which there no satisfactory answer. Has writing The Ratline brought you closer to understanding where such antisemitism comes from? Otto is easier to account for. It comes through his dad, a German nationalist: the idea that in Vienna there are all these Jews from the east coming in. But Charlotte was from a little town. There were only Jews there; her family were magnates, not downtrodden. The Catholic church played a role, and I suspect there was also a deep-seated fear of Bolshevism, which was considered a Jewish idea. Is anti semitism on the rise again? Are there parallels to be made? I don’t think it rampant in Britain. It there on the far left, and the far right – and plainly, under Jeremy Corbyn, things were allowed to happen in the Labour party that shouldn’t have. But in Europe, there no question it is. The tropes in places like Hungary are very clear. Are you frightened? Can it be stopped? I don’t think history repeats itself, but nor does it learn. You get variations on a theme. When the coronavirus crisis is over, nationalism could be rampant. Or we could remember the lessons of the that the only way out of recession is via global solidarity and trade. Either way, we need to pay attention. Viktor Orbán new laws in Hungary are unparalleled in Europe. He can rule open-endedly by decree. Let consider our own emergency legislation. Yes, it must be reviewed by parliament in six months. But who would have thought that in we’d have a situation where people over are told they can’t leave the house? How much of a leap is it from that to: OK, we’re going to place the elderly in “safe areas”? To care-home ghettoes? On the trail of a Nazi war criminal: 'It my duty as a son to find the good in my father' Four million Jews died in Galicia, including your grandfather family, yet when Horst tries to defend his father, you remain so calm, so dispassionate. How did you do it? I do lose my rag with him at one point. My mother-in-law calls it my “elder abuse moment”. I’m a very emotional person. But I strip the emotion out of my sentences. It years of training and the practice of the golden rule of not showing your feelings in court. What difference has East West Street , and everything that has followed from that trip to Lviv, made to your life? It has made the past easier. The war was a dark hole that no one talked about. I think it has made my mum life easier, too [his mother, Ruth, was carried as a baby to safety in Paris from Vienna in the arms of a stranger whose identity he was able to discover]. Do you know what you’ll write next? Yes, and you couldn’t make it up. There a character in The Ratline : a Nazi who escapes to Syria, and then to Chile. He worked for General Pinochet interrogation service. The book is about his connection to the events that later catalyse Pinochet arrest in London, a case in which I was involved as a lawyer.

15,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/12/a-journal-of-the-plague-year-fictional-not-untrue-daniel-defoe,"Before we even began reading A Journal of the Plague Year together, it felt like an obvious choice as we try to find our way through this pandemic. That feeling only grew when we began, and I saw its many parallels to our current situation. But it also seems strange that this particular book should have been preserved by history – not least because, as a historical account, it pretty dubious. Most now think of it as fiction, despite the frontispiece claim that the book was “by a CITIZEN who continued all the while in London”. It possible that there were readers in Defoe time who bought that line, although there are no known records of the book original reception . Later editions of the book were presented as history and it was cited as such throughout the century in other books about the plague. There also evidence that people took it to be serious reportage on into the century, even after Defoe authorship of the book had been established. In Edward Wedlake Brayley wrote in his book The Beauties of England and Wales that the Journal was “a genuine piece of history” and doubled down in when he edited the Journal and claimed it was “emphatically not a fiction”. As late as Watson Nicholson wrote in his book The Historical Sources of Defoe Journal of the Plague Year that “there is not one single statement in the Journal, pertinent to the history of the Great Plague in London, that has not been verified”, and that it should be regarded as “authentic history”. That a pretty amazing claim, given the moment late on in the book where our narrator describes Old Bethlem churchyard and says: “The Author Of This Journal, lyes buried in that very Ground, being at his own Desire, his sister having been buried there a few years before.” That not the only thing that calls the veracity of the account into question. It is full of details that can only have come from the imagination. Most notably, Defoe gives a long, rambling account of three men (John, Richard and Thomas) who fled London and admits that this tale is not strictly documentary. “Their Story has a Moral in every Part of it,” he says, “and if there was not other End in recording it, I think this a very just one, whether my Account be exactly according to Fact or no.” Theirs is fantastic adventure, with fraudulent documents and encounters with hostile, frightened people protecting their villages from the infected. There a wonderful piece of theatre where the men manage to convince people at a checkpoint that they are among a squad of armed and dangerous military men and have to be allowed to travel. There is snappy dialogue, set out as if in play: Village constable: Why you will not pretend to quarter us by Force, will you? John: We have offer’d no Violence to you yet, why do you seem to oblige us to it? It all interesting and entertaining, but even the “CITIZEN who continued all the while in London” couldn’t possibly have heard such conversations. To say so is not a criticism. Some of the most astonishing moments in the book could be pure invention. The woman who strikes the narrator with “horror and a chillness in my very blood” by shrieking out of a window: “Oh! death, death, death!” Or the “speaking sight” of the plague pit, dozens of bodies “huddled together, rich and poor”, naked and in rags. The narrator tells us he persuaded a sexton to let him in and was given the memorable warning that it “will be a sermon to you, it may be, the best that ever you heard in your life.” These scenes are vivid and shocking – but to believe them, we also have to believe that the narrator was indeed there, not to mention possessed of a faultless memory. But that doesn’t matter. As you’re reading, it feels right. A more perceptive critic, writing anonymously in the Quarterly Theological Review in said: “Defoe journal is the most lively Picture of Truth which ever proceeded from imagination.” Or, as Anthony Burgess put it in his introduction to the Penguin edition, Defoe “truth is twofold: it has the truth of the conscientious and scrupulous historian, but its deeper truth belongs to the creative imagination.” It a book that speaks to us in a very real way – even if it sometimes has a tenuous relationship with reality.",751
16,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/11/poem-of-the-week-of-bronze-and-blaze-319-by-emily-dickinson,"Of Bronze — and Blaze — The North — tonight — So adequate — it forms — So preconcerted with itself — So distant — to alarms — An Unconcern so sovreign To Universe, or me — Infects my simple spirit With Taints of Majesty — Till I take vaster attitudes — And strut opon my stem — Disdaining Men, and Oxygen, For Arrogance of them — My Splendors, are Menagerie — But their Competeless Show Will entertain the Centuries When I, am long ago, An Island in dishonored Grass — Whom none but Daisies — know. “Charged particles from the sun entering Earth atmosphere create the vibrant colours,” says this guide to the best views of the Northern Lights in the US. Look at the view from the Aroostook National Wildlife Refuge to get an idea of the impressive aurora borealis Emily Dickinson might have been able to see from her home in Amherst, Massachusetts. The poem focus is immediate and simple. No fulsome adjectives, no list of colours, diffuses it. Dickinson selects a single colour-associated noun, “bronze”, and pairs it with “blaze” – a noun that connotes the effect of fire, or intense fiery light. Single-syllabled and alliterative, the twinned words also gain resonance from their surrounding Dickinsonian typography – the capital opening letter and the dash. An alloy, predominantly featuring copper, bronze is a highly versatile substance – and has an interesting etymology. It derived from the Italian, bronzo, meaning bell metal – brass. The ecclesiastical symbol might be relevant to the poem, but there another set of connotations perhaps more significant. Bronze was the material used for cannons, to ensure the iron cannonballs wouldn’t adhere to gun inner lining. In Greek historiography, there were three ages, gold, silver and bronze, the latter being the Age of Heroes. For the speaker in the poem, the North in its shining bronze is distant and impassive, perhaps like armour, or an armoury. The unheard “alarms”, pointing up its lack of response, would fit the military metaphor. Even that strange phrase “so preconcerted with itself” has a suggestion of armies purposefully massed, positioned and concentrating on the forthcoming action. The poem belongs to Packet XIV of her manuscripts and was written between and It may predate the civil war but Dickinson response to the war remains an interesting topic. The Emily Dickinson Museum site is helpful. It reminds us that roughly half of Dickinson output coincided with the war. She acknowledged its influence in a family letter, saying that she wrote “off charnel steps”. The references remain oblique, of course. Interestingly for the current poem, her most overt, or least covert, “war poem” features a bell in the third stanza, which begins “the possibility — to pass / Without a moment Bell / Into Conjecture presence / Is like a Face of Steel”. The bell not rung symbolises the anonymous, sudden and sometimes unrecorded deaths of the battlefield. There a moral warning, clearly sounded, in the current poem, which may or may not encode an anti-war position. The warning immediately relates to the effects of witnessing stupendous sights. An unexpected metaphor of disease reinforces the perceived need for resistance: the speaker, and the universe itself, risk being infected with “Taints of Majesty”. The magnificent disinterest of the aurora borealis shouldn’t delude its witnesses into a sense of elevation. Dickinson is a forceful anti-Romantic and anti-Transcendentalist literary critic here, as well as a moralist. The clinching correction of possible “vaster attitudes” comes in the image of a cultivated plant that, absurdly, “strut[s] opon its stem” when in reality it not only tethered to the earth but dependent on “Men, and Oxygen”. The poem concluding sestet piles on further (apparent) self-denigration. “My Splendors, are Menagerie” is a superbly weighted oxymoron – perhaps weighted towards irony. The puzzle is in the next line and, especially, the word “competeless”. It easy to misread it as “completeless” – a feasible synonym for “uncompleted” with the bonus of suggesting the “Show” is not only uncompleted but non-completable. The implications of “competeless” take us in the opposite direction – to competition. As with the Northern Lights, there is nothing to compete with the speaker display, which will “Entertain the Centuries / When I, am long ago”. That last clause compresses time and tense, vividly enhanced by avoiding the putative vagueness of “when I will have existed long ago”. Why does the speaker grave “dishonour” the grass? Is this a continuation of the ironical tone? The “islanded” grave is far from presumptuous. It so modestly situated, so ancient, unvisited and overgrown, that only daisies know it there. Earlier printings give “beetles” instead of “daisies” – but “daisies” is, hopefully, the right editorial decision, introducing another, humbler member of the plant world to contrast with the deluded flower strutting on its stem in line But, finally, I can’t decide if the poet is claiming immortality for her work: I am not even sure that the speaker is Emily Dickinson or any poet. I tried reading it as if spoken by a flower, viewing the lights of the poet house at nightfall, a distant, incomprehensible blaze. (Not a very good idea, but interesting at first.) The difficulty of interpretation is part of the attraction. Dickinson poems often seem to have travelled to Earth from far away. This one is another “charged particle of sunlight” transforming our horizons with a constantly shifting and expanding play of ideas.",906
17,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/11/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week,"Welcome to this week blogpost. Here our roundup of your comments and photos from the last week. First, Hilary Mantel The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher has provided welcome distraction for MaggieMaggieB : I was finding it difficult to concentrate on a book as I was worrying about my son and daughter and missing my grandsons so I thought that I would try short stories. They were just what was needed. I found them easy to read and the title story turned out to be surprisingly cosy. The other tales were very varied and well observed, ranging from an account of two bored children antics during a hot summer to a vampire story! Elmore Leonard Pickup has been ideal lockdown reading for RickLondon : This week I read an early Elmore Leonard, Pickup; and if his absolute mastery of plotting was not totally refined by this point, his brilliant dialogue and characterisation was much in evidence. A perfect lockdown read. It been a while Elmore, but I’m not going to wait so long for the next fix. Alice Munro has been keeping lonelybloomer going: I have also taken to reading an Munro story every morning and I went through a couple of her collections this way. Very enjoyable (I love Munro!). Peter Robinson short story anthology Not Safe After Dark has provoked a powerful reaction from PatLux : One of the stories, Memory Lane, had a strong effect on me. Its setting is a care home and it was ironic to read it as Brexitland went all nostalgic about VE day at the same time as allowing so many elderly people to needlessly die alone in care homes. In a story much to reflect on about our current times and about the lives and experiences of war “heroes”. Art and life, life and art. Wild Women is a “fine collection of tales by female travellers, put together by Mariella Frostrup,” says laidbackviews : She brings us selected highlights from authors, taking us to all parts of the globe and using pretty much every means of transport. There some old favourites in there, and some new ones to discover. I find myself making lists, starting with a short one of writers that could have been there; and ending up with another of writers of whom I’d like to read more. On the former I’d have Elly Beinhorn and Annemarie Schwarzenbach from the golden age, and Anna Badkhen and Kate Harris from the here and now. But it is the deliciously named Aloha Wanderwell who heads the second list, having enticed me in and left me keen to see if she lived up to her destiny. James Baldwin If Beale Street Could Talk has remained with booklooker for a long time: What is the magic phrase again? “You are too young for this book!” – from my (much older) sister who was fencing off my query what it was about. So this is how I came to read James Baldwin If Beale Street Could Talk at (ish): stealing it from its place on the shelf at opportune moments. I suppose I was too young for the book, as with many others that were all the more attractive for being forbidden ... Please do tell me I am not the only one who sneaked reads from an early age! Both love story and police brutality impressed me very much at the time. I also remember very vivid descriptions of what racism feels like on the body - and how you can be forced to view yourself as others do, momentarily. “I’ve finished The Mystery Of A Hansom Cab by Fergus Hume,” says SydneyH : A nineteenth century “sensation” novel, in which a man is murdered in the back of the titular vehicle. The text is justifiably best known for the astonishing number of copies sold, though it is also noted as an early work of detective fiction and Australian literature. I think it is also an inspiration for people considering self-publishing. I’m particularly pleased to discover that a parody was written titled The Mystery of a Wheelbarrow. “I can really recommend English Monsters by James Scudamore,” says bindithecat : I picked it up knowing nothing about the book or its author and was immediately engrossed as soon as I had started. To begin with it about a year old boy living on a ramshackle farm in the English countryside with his eccentric grandparents while his parents are expats in Mexico. At the age of or he is sent away to a local boarding school where the usual sadistic masters rule. He falls in with a group of friends and they more or less support each other and keep in touch into adulthood … Although the subject matter may sound depressing, it is a surprisingly funny book, especially the bits about the boy grandfather. Finally, tiojo compares two masterpieces, Graham Greene The Heart Of The Matter and Joseph Conrad Lord Jim: In both books the main character faces a moral dilemma and in both the author has chosen an exotic colonial location in which the dilemma plays out. Also in both, the authors have managed to gain the reader sympathy for their flawed heroes and their moral struggles. Both of them cloak their exploration of morals in a more expansive tale - Conrad with his adventures on the high seas, Greene a more subtle story of wartime colonial intrigue. And for both they draw on their own personal experience – Conrad as a seaman, Greene from his time spent in west Africa as a young man. In some ways they might be seen as giving hope to the aspiring writer. The moral dilemmas they explore are ones that are faced by many people in their everyday experience. They are using their own life experience to put them into a setting in which the tale can be told. But both of them are master craftsmen. Both writers of high quality. High quality, indeed. Interesting links about books and reading Light at the end of the tunnel. Shakespeare &amp; Company are reopening in Paris and their online store is back in operation. Less good news: the annual Hemingway lookalike competition has been postponed . When James Baldwin wrote about the Atlanta child murders . The New York Public library have created a sounds of New York album . Some “superbly entertaining” romantic letters, written in the second world war and discovered by chance, are creating a real stir . The New York Times provide a guide to reading the great Stephen King .

18,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/25/which-novels-or-memoirs-will-help-prepare-me-for-motherhood,"Q: Can you recommend any particularly good novels or memoirs about the experience of motherhood? I have a few months to prepare and this feels as important as collecting tiny babygrows. Sophie Lim, London A: Francesca Segal, author of Mother Ship (Vintage, , writes: First of all, congratulations – I so clearly remember the urge to understand the lay of that strange new territory ahead, longing for books that might offer a way in, if only for a moment. Making Babies by Anne Enright is a wonderful place to begin, because it is funny and poignant and vivid and written by a woman who is happy in her maternity, clear-eyed, but not frightening. Anne LaMott Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Son First Year made me roar with laughter, and is joyous because it shows that you do not have to have every black-and-white frieze hung, every muslin ironed, each educational material absorbed – you do not need a perfect life, merely an open heart and, to quote Mary Oliver , “to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves”.’ A recovering alcoholic with no money and no co-parent, LaMott does a beautiful job of loving and raising her son, who grows up to be a thoroughly good egg. I’d be remiss to leave out the magnificent A Life Work by Rachel Cusk, a pitch-perfect exploration of the claustrophobia and ambivalence that can come with serving the whims of a new “tetchy monarch”. Hey Yeah Right Get a Life by the wonderful Helen Simpson has a not-great title and a terrible jacket, but is one of the most incredible short story collections about motherhood, and has women I know who’ve read it banging their fists on the table with rage and recognition and vindication. Amy Bloom has always written achingly beautiful mother-love tales, in both A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You , another short story collection, or her novel, Away , which is a mother picaresque journey across the US to find her lost daughter. Finally, Where’d You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple is an excellent parody of life at the school gates, and means that in the future you will never be remotely surprised by an email demanding that you arrive the following morning with a pair of green tights, six printed family portraits, a list of every vegetable in your crisper drawer, and a tulip bulb. Armed with these texts, you will be ninja-ready. Submit your question for Book Clinic below or email bookclinic@observer.co.uk",423

From a seafarer to a tale from beyond the end of civilisation, via nuclear intrigue and the testimony of a future clone, these dizzying narratives are delicately interlinked, highlighting the echoes and recurrences of the vast human symphony. Read the review Autumn by Ali Smith Smith began writing her Seasonal Quartet, a still-ongoing experiment in quickfire publishing, against the background of the EU referendum. The resulting “first Brexit novel” isn’t just a snapshot of a newly divided Britain, but a dazzling exploration into love and art, time and dreams, life and death, all done with her customary invention and wit. Read the review Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates Coates impassioned meditation on what it means to be a black American today made him one of the country most important intellectuals and writers. Having grown up the son of a former Black Panther on the violent streets of Baltimore, he has a voice that is challenging but also poetic. Between the World and Me takes the form of a letter to his teenage son, and ranges from the daily reality of racial injustice and police violence to the history of slavery and the civil war: white people, he writes, will never remember “the scale of theft that enriched them”. Read the review The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman Children fiction came of age when the final part of Pullman His Dark Materials trilogy became the first book for younger readers to win the Whitbread book of the year award. Pullman has brought imaginative fire and storytelling bravado to the weightiest of subjects: religion, free will, totalitarian structures and the human drive to learn, rebel and grow. Here Asriel struggle against the Authority reaches its climax, Lyra and Will journey to the Land of the Dead, and Mary investigates the mysterious elementary particles that lend their name to his current trilogy: The Book of Dust. The Hollywood-fuelled commercial success achieved by JK Rowling may have eluded Pullman so far, but his sophisticated reworking of Paradise Lost helped adult readers throw off any embarrassment at enjoying fiction written for children – and publishing has never looked back. Read the review Austerlitz by WG Sebald translated by Anthea Bell Sebald died in a car crash in but his genre-defying mix of fact and fiction, keen sense of the moral weight of history and interleaving of inner and outer journeys have had a huge influence on the contemporary literary landscape. His final work, the typically allusive life story of one man, charts the Jewish disapora and lost century with heartbreaking power. Read the review Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro From his Booker winner The Remains of the Day to The Buried Giant , Nobel laureate Ishiguro writes profound, puzzling allegories about history, nationalism and the individual place in a world that is always beyond our understanding. His sixth novel, a love triangle set among human clones in an alternative England, brings exquisite understatement to its exploration of mortality, loss and what it means to be human. Read the review Secondhand Time by Svetlana Alexievich translated by Bela Shayevich The Belarusian Nobel laureate recorded thousands of hours of testimony from ordinary people to create this oral history of the Soviet Union and its end. Writers, waiters, doctors, soldiers, former Kremlin apparatchiks, gulag survivors: all are given space to tell their stories, share their anger and betrayal, and voice their worries about the transition to capitalism. An unforgettable book, which is both an act of catharsis and a profound demonstration of empathy. Gilead by Marilynne Robinson Robinson meditative, deeply philosophical novel is told through letters written by elderly preacher John Ames in the to his young son who, when he finally reaches an adulthood his father won’t see, will at least have this posthumous one-sided conversation: “While you read this, I am imperishable, somehow more alive than I have ever been.” This is a book about legacy, a record of a pocket of America that will never return, a reminder of the heartbreaking, ephemeral beauty that can be found in everyday life. As Ames concludes, to his son and himself: “There are a thousand thousand reasons to live this life, every one of them sufficient.” Read the review Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel Mantel had been publishing for a quarter century before the project that made her a phenomenon, set to be concluded with the third part of the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light , next March. To read her story of the rise of Thomas Cromwell at the Tudor court, detailing the making of a new England and the self-creation of a new kind of man, is to step into the stream of her irresistibly authoritative present tense and find oneself looking out from behind her hero eyes. The surface details are sensuously, vividly immediate, the language as fresh as new paint; but her exploration of power, fate and fortune is also deeply considered and constantly in dialogue with our own era, as we are shaped and created by the past. In this book we have, as she intended, “a sense of history listening and talking to itself”. Read the review To order any of these titles go to guardianbookshop.com or call .

20,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/11/from-nhs-memoirs-to-the-bell-jar-the-best-books-about-burnout,"e need our health service now more than ever. Coronavirus has come at a time when we thought there was no more stretch left in the NHS, but healthcare workers are still finding the energy and enthusiasm to provide care for all those in need. Due to the crisis, medical staff around the world are at an even greater risk of suffering burnout. Adam Kay hugely popular, funny and heartbreaking memoir This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diar ies of a Junior Doctor brought the everyday realities of extreme fatigue to the forefront of public consciousness. Nurses and doctors have been leaving the profession in order to safeguard their own health and wellbeing, but a sense of duty has now called many back to the frontline. Joanna Cannon empathy for the patients she writes about in her poignant memoir, Breaking &amp; Mending , again shows how challenging working in healthcare can be. Cannon worked as a hospital doctor before specialising in psychiatry. She finds it is nearly impossible to give the standard of care that people deserve without diminishing her emotional reserves. My novel Rest and Be Thankful tells the story of a nurse working a string of nightshifts who is so exhausted that she see things that aren’t there; the effects of sleeplessness seeps into every aspect of her life. Last year the World Health Organi zation updated its definition of burnout, describing it as an “occupational phenomenon”. There is hope that this definition will increase awareness and understanding. But sufferers do not just work in the medical professions. The Unnamed by Joshua Ferris presents a New York lawyer with a mysterious condition that pushes him to exhaustion. He is compelled to walk, his body propels him, but the relentless walking wears him away physically and emotionally. There is no sympathy, no understanding. He is relegated to a tiny office where his depleting form can be hidden from view. It is a story of life taken for granted. Perfection and expectation overwhelm Sylvia Plath narrator Esther in The Bell Jar . Pressing against the narrow ideas of womanhood, she is overcome by depression. The successes of her earlier life have led her to setting herself unobtainable goals, which gradually push her to the point of despair. “The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn’t thought about it.” Bringing a lighter touch to the subject, Lauren Weisberger novel The Devil Wears Prada tells the story of Andrea, a young woman working in the fashion industry who struggles to meet the demands of her boss. Her relationships become strained as she prioritises her work until she snaps. Despite the glamour, gossip and hilarity, Andrea finds herself having to rebuild her life. We, the Survivors by Tash Aw shows that not all cases of burnout happen quickly. Ah Hock is an ordinary, hard-working man who has committed murder and is serving his time. He remorsefully recounts his life to a student, who interviews him for her dissertation. It is the portrait of a man who strives against poverty, labour exploitation and a rapidly modernising society. His struggle is quiet, painful and lifelong. Rest and Be Thankful by Emma Glass is published by Bloomsbury.",535
21,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/13/top-10-books-about-iran-nazanine-hozar-aria,"Iran is an ancient country with a complex people, among them some of the greatest poets who ever lived. Sadly, the Iranian novel has yet to reach the popularity of the country poetry. This is perhaps because there is something enigmatic about how Persian prose is written, often using surrealism and magical realism to mimic the playfulness in its poetry. No matter what Iranians do, even if they write historical textbooks, it seems they can never shed the poetic touch. Aria by Nazanine Hozar review – an epic tale of turmoil in Tehran But that is the beauty of the culture. From memoirs to history books, writing about Iran, thinking “in Iranian”, even if writing from a desk in Canada or the US, alters the writer state of mind as he or she navigates a culture both tender and resolute. I never had the chance to master Persian. Having somehow gotten away from the brutality of the Islamic Republic regime and the seemingly endless war with Iraq, I went from being an inheritor of the Persian Ghazal to a student of the English novel. With this new form, in my new language there was the opportunity to venture beyond the enigmatic Persian tradition. I’m not trying to write about Iran. I’m trying to write about people who are trapped, which is what I’ve tried to do in my novel Aria . All the books I’ve suggested here are in their own way about entrapment, except for the poems written by Sohrab Sepehri, who, being the lone poet out of the lot, is teaching the others how to set themselves free. The Blind Owl by Sadegh Hedayat It would be impossible to begin a discussion on modern Iranian literature without including this masterwork by the father of Persian magical realism. The Blind Owl is a feverish tale of a pen-case painter descent into the nightmare of his own psyche as the reader is exposed to his mistrust of oppressive forces, abuse of power, sexual and gender hierarchy, and the constraints of modern Iranian society. No other novel better illuminates the state of modern Iranian alienation and isolation, or the Persian ability to make the disturbing beautiful. My Uncle Napoleon by Iraj Pezeshkzad translated by Dick Davis A coming-of-age story following an unnamed year-old narrator as he observes his dysfunctional family and neighbours, in particular the eccentric family patriarch, uncle Napoleon – nicknamed sarcastically for his obsession with the French emperor. The story, set during the becomes somewhat “ absurd ” with its larger than life characters and their exaggerated circumstances. But Pezeshkzad is working in the great tradition of Asian and Middle Eastern literature. Imagine One Thousand and One Nights transported into the intimate neighbourhoods of Tehran. Saved By Beauty by Roger Housden A travel memoir by the British-American Housden, whose love of Rumi propels him to discover the poet culture. His quest to understand the complexities of Iran initially binds him to the country rich heritage of poetry, mysticism, art and architecture, as well as the many friends he meets along the way. But despite his steadfast desire to focus solely on the country beauty, Housden has to face the Islamic Republic darkness and ideological quagmire. Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi Satrapi autobiographical graphic novel is the story of her upbringing in post-revolutionary Iran. Apart from its whimsy and appealing graphics, what makes the narrative matter is Satrapi viewpoint as an upper-class Iranian child suddenly wary of the differences in class and religious expression. These moments provide the more humorous observations in the book, and the most touching. The storytelling is honest and, in what can also be found in the great tradition of Iranian cinema, Satrapi achieves the most poignancy by telling her tale through the eyes of a confused and curious child. Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian Published in this is a look at the era between the constitutional revolution of and the Islamic revolution of each driven by divisions in religion, ethnicity and class. It is perhaps the most thorough investigation into the reigns of both Pahlavi kings and the British and American interference that permitted their rule and one-party system, fuelling the Islamist and communist movements in the and culminating in the revolution. Touba and the Meaning of Night by Shahrnush Parsipur Written after the author had spent more than four years in an Iranian political prison, Parsipur works have been banned by the Islamic Republic. This novel reflects on the changing politics of Iran from the onset of the century through the constricted life of a bold young woman, Touba. After her father dies when she is and she is left to her own devices, Touba proposes marriage to a man hoping it will bring her survival and prosperity. The novel offers a rare, detailed and sophisticated insight into women lives in Iran, in a world where men hold all power, and where women suffer needlessly – sometimes horrifically – because of it. The best books on Iran: start your reading here | Pushpinder Khaneka Things We Left Unsaid by Zoya Pirzad Iranian-Armenian Pirzad sets her tale in Abadan amid the apparent tranquillity of domestic life. She slowly guides her main character, the daydreaming mother and wife Clarice, towards the growing awareness of gender inequality in the as Clarice begins to question the roles prescribed for her and other women. The nuanced tension focused on sexuality and gender throughout the narrative could arguably be Pirzad commentary on current Iranian societal and gender divisions without drawing the ire of the censors. A Selection of Poems from The Eight Books by Sohrab Sepehri, translated by Bahiyeh Afnan Shahid Every Iranian has their personal favourite modern poet, from Ahmad Shamlou to Forough Farrokhzad to Simin Behbahani. Mine is Sepehri. His work more than the rest belongs in the category of monumental Persian mystical poets such as Rumi, Hafez, Saadi and Khayaam. Sepehri died of cancer in Better known in his lifetime as a painter, the complexities of his poetry were most associated, like his painting, with his love of nature. But there is also a connection, much like Rumi, with the most profound understandings of Sufi Islam, Vedanta philosophy, and perhaps the very early Christian teachings. Sepehri never proselytized but his mind and heart are laid bare in The Eight Books, a selection of which have been beautifully translated by Shahid. Top political travel books Journey From The Land of No by Roya Hakakian This memoir from Iranian-Jewish writer and journalist Hakakian traces her growth as a budding revolutionary in towards the realisation that the political reforms she and her friends had fought for had been hijacked and undermined by a religious totalitarianism not only targeted at her own Jewish community but at intellectual, egalitarian and democratising Iranians alike, regardless of faith. Hakakian particularly focuses on the violations of women rights as the first sign that any political system is poised to fall to autocracy. Iran: A Modern History by Abbas Amanat A meticulously researched account of the past years of Iranian history, beginning with the rise of the Safavid dynasty and the entrenchment of Shia Islam and its clerical establishment into the Persian ruling classes. Amanat spent two decades writing his book, not only tracing historical tales of political intrigue but also delving into Iran shifting position in imperial geopolitics. In so doing, he attempts to draw meaning from this history by looking for parallels between Persia unstable Safavid past and Iran current theocratic regime.

23,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/10/could-lockdown-herald-an-exciting-new-chapter-for-the-book-trade,"n March, Emma Corfield-Walters received the news that for the second year running, her shop, Book-ish, in Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons, had landed the title for Wales in the regional round of the independent bookshop of the year award. Corfield-Walters has run Book-ish for years. It has staff and a cafe, is the base for a literary festival that she also organises, and is credited with having played a major part in the regeneration of Crickhowell award-winning high street. Above all, it is a highly successful business: was a record year. The fact that it would now again be a contender for the overall prize – to be announced in June at the British book awards – was for Corfield-Walters a hard-earned affirmation of a decade passion and work. But she was hardly celebrating. Britain was then five days from lockdown. “It was surreal,” she says. “We’d won best bookshop in Wales, yet I wasn’t sure for how much longer I’d have a shop that people could visit. It was like that scene in Star Wars when the walls are moving in, and the room getting smaller and smaller. The goalposts were shifting every day. At first, we thought: OK, we’ll buy hand sanitiser! But by the weekend, it was clear the shop would have to close.” Her first thought was for her staff, who are “like family” to her; the government subsequent announcement of its furlough scheme came as a huge relief. But there was also the question of her stock, and how she might keep selling it. Suddenly, the Book-ish website, hitherto used only to sell event tickets and signed copies, came into its own: “On the Saturday before lockdown began, we managed to get all titles from the shop on to our website.” What life like now? Luckily, her wholesaler has remained open, and can help with the delivery of titles not in the shop. But mostly, she spends her days operating as a frantic one-woman postal machine: “I’m on my own here, fielding calls, tweets, Facebook, managing the website, and picking and packing, picking and packing.” Her customers have been supportive. Some days, she sends out up to parcels. However, this cannot make up for the shortfall in income that is the result of a closed shop and cafe. “We’re about down,” she says. “Though across the trade, that relatively good. I’m on the council of the Booksellers Association, and on average, those shops that are still able to send out books are making only about of their normal sales.” What about reopening? Will this happen soon? She agrees there are good reasons for bookshops to be included in the first wave of non-essential businesses to reopen in any loosening of the lockdown; reading, as the World Health Organization notes, can boost mental health. But logistically, it going to be difficult: “I’m not sure how we’d open for browsing. Most independent shops are small. We’re not chains; we don’t have the infrastructure to make major changes in the way we operate. We’re also community hubs. We had a very emotional conversation on Zoom yesterday at the Booksellers Network coffee morning. People were worrying about their vulnerable customers: the ones who come in for a glass of water, the older person who just wants a chat. How will this work with social distancing? Realistically, I can’t see us opening before September.” How long can she keep going financially? For the first time in our conversation, she is briefly silent. “I don’t know,” she says, at last. “I’ve been too scared to do cashflow projections. My landlord has been great, and reduced my rent. But I’ve still got utilities bills and insurance to think about. If this level of sales carries on, I’ll be able to pay my overheads. But if government support for the furlough scheme stops, there will be, across the trade, redundancies. That terrifies me.” Does she expect some shops to close? “I’m not sure. I have friends at indies that have done so well in the past three years. They’re so forward-thinking and creative. But if you’ve rent to pay, and no website… ” What about her? Will Book-ish get out of this alive? She is determined that it will: “We’re all in flight or fight mode at the moment – and I’m fighting.” When the lockdown began on March , the ramifications for the book industry were extremely grave. Waterstones closed all of its branches, its chief executive, James Daunt, having previously insisted the chain was no different to a pharmacy or a supermarket and would therefore stay open (the U-turn came after some staff complained they felt at risk, and had been given no protection or hand sanitiser). Britain independent book stores also shut their doors (at the end of there were such shops in the UK and Ireland). Supermarkets, which sell popular books in large quantities, focused their efforts on food and ceased ordering from publishers. Meanwhile, Amazon suddenly and dramatically “de-prioritised” book sales in favour of what it deemed to be essential goods (food, yes, but also, it would seem, hair dye and DIY equipment). People were shocked. “It was a precipice at first,” says Jeremy Trevathan, the publisher of Macmillan adult division (he oversees Macmillan, Pan and Picador). “We thought: this is so grim.” Jo Prior, managing director at Penguin General, felt the same way. “It was alarming and strange when the shops closed; very shocking and dramatic.” Sales plummeted. “Some publishers are saying they went down up to says Philip Jones, editor of the Bookseller . For some it was even worse than that. The small presses, which have no marketing budget, depend on booksellers to press their titles into the hands of readers. “Bookshop sales are down by says Kevin Duffy, who runs Blue Moose, a publisher based in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. “It horrific. We need the high street to open tomorrow. If it doesn’t happen by September, we’re going to be in dire straits.” Approaches to the emergency varied. At Macmillan, executives took voluntary pay cuts on a sliding scale from rising to (its managing director, Anthony Forbes Watson, took a cut). Only three staff were furloughed. At Faber, on the other hand, the sales team has been furloughed almost in its entirety; the publishing schedule having been radically reduced, the work wasn’t there for people to do, while its international sales team cannot currently travel, which makes their jobs difficult. At Penguin, some employees have been furloughed, but “patchily”, across the business. “I’ve furloughed members of my communications team,” says Prior. “We’re resting them because they were working on books that are now delayed.” How many books have been delayed? Again, the picture isn’t consistent (though spooked newspaper literary editors will testify to the scale of the shift; at one point about a month ago, the volume of books coming in for review was noticeably dwindling). While some have pushed the publication of new titles into the autumn, others have moved them into “We did take the decision to move off a huge amount into July and the autumn,” says Prior. “Not everything: the new Lee Child has just come out. Mrs Hinch [the Instagram cleaning expert] is doing well. But most things – things that are dependent on physical retail for support – will be published when we expect shops to be open.” At Faber, most of its list has been moved on. “We’ve turned the dial, pushing everything on three or four months,” says Stephen Page, its chief executive. “But we’ve put most literary debuts, which need the oxygen of booksellers, into because the autumn is going to be so crowded.” All this isn’t without risk. “We still don’t know what the autumn is going look like,” says Philip Jones. “There are no guarantees. But even if things are close to normal, the danger is that many of these books may get lost in the trample.” A recent survey suggested that of people say that books have helped them get through the lockdown How soon will the high street reopen? “There been a lot of chatter,” says Daunt. “But we need to be told when we can reopen, and no one from government has been in touch.” Is he making preparations? “Yes. It requires a lot of operational thought: a lot of training and investment. It a far from trivial exercise. How do you ensure your staff are protected and customers properly informed?” Unlike the independents, Waterstones branches are relatively big. “There never a great intensity to book shopping outside of December, and we have tables, which can act as a means of ensuring social distance. Still, it extremely challenging. Every part of retail will be different. Bookselling is our profession and our vocation; we want to be open. But we don’t want to do it prematurely, or to be out of sync with our customers. Some places are not going to be busy for a while: out-of-town shopping centres, our big metropolitan city-centre shops; people aren’t going to want to get on the underground to go to Piccadilly to buy a book.” Nevertheless, he is upbeat. “We are profitable and well run; we have been through hard times before. But also, we have something people really want to buy.” This much is certainly true. In the days before the lockdown began, Waterstones reported a uplift in sales, a rise that has only grown in the weeks since; a central irony, for publishers, has been that in the moment when books have been suddenly more difficult to get hold of, demand for them has never been higher. A recent survey suggested that of people say that books have helped them get through the lockdown . All publishers report a dramatic increase in traffic on their websites, and in ebook and audio sales. Online sales at Waterstones are growing each day; as I write they are up some a long line of Royal Mail trucks queuing outside its warehouse every night, where there used only to be one. “It still a relatively small proportion of the sales that were coming out of our shops,” says Daunt. “But hopefully, customers can now see that online is not a monopoly.” Publishers are unsurprisingly thrilled by this. Can Amazon monopoly be broken? “One thing that must come out of this is a model where online selling is more plural,” says Stephen Page. Publishers are cagey about the idea of getting into selling themselves. Some dismiss the idea out of hand: it too complex and too expensive; they don’t want to anger Amazon. Others, off the record, agree that the industry is having this conversation. It has been forcefully brought home to them, Amazon having, as Philip Jones puts it, “turned off the tap” of supply so suddenly, that they have grown too dependent on it; that the supply chain is too fragile. “This is the moment,” says Jonny Geller, a literary agent who represents, among others, John le Carré, Howard Jacobson and Elif Shafak. “I’ve been saying this to them [publishers] for years: why do you not go into direct selling? You have the data, the bookclubs, the websites. Previously, they just preferred to pump money into ailing chains, but I think they’re now being forced to consider it – and if this situation goes on much longer, they will have to.” He sounds frustrated. “Television, which is much more expensive to make, has worked out how to deliver content to people. Publishing is just clinging to the same model it had in When Tony Parsons new novel came out [Parsons is another of Geller clients], you couldn’t get hold of his book – but on the same day, I ordered a badminton kit from Amazon that arrived the following morning.” Writers are well equipped. They’re experiencing what they always experience: self-isolation Jonny Geller, literary agent Geller is also critical of the decision of publishers to push back their schedules. “They’re concentrating too much on furloughing and saving and hunkering down. It such a narrow approach, everything in the deep freeze. Another of my clients, Alastair Campbell [Tony Blair former press secretary], has written a very powerful book about depression. It was planned for spring, now it will come out in August or September. I’m troubled by this. If there was ever a time for a book of this kind, it now. I think this is where morale is low for authors – and if publishers had invested better in distribution, we wouldn’t be having these debates. They’d just be publishing as usual.” How are writers responding to the changes and uncertainty? “They’re well equipped. They’re experiencing what they always experience: self-isolation. But it also hard to know what to write, what relevant. That the deeper question. And I do feel desperately sorry for some of those being published now. For many of them, publication has just gone by.” Authors whose books have been published during this time have mixed feelings about it. “I’m publishing into a big, black hole ,” Lionel Shriver tells me, though she adds that her sense of “personal loss” is valuable in writerly terms: she better understands what so many others are going through. But for some, it is, if they’re honest, a boon in terms of coverage, if not in sales: with fewer books being published, less obvious titles are more likely to be reviewed. This said, writers cannot look forward, this year, to going out into the world to talk about their books. Literary festivals are a major victim of the virus. Hay and Edinburgh fell early, and others followed. Cheltenham, held in October, is still booking writers. But it hard to see, realistically, how it can go ahead; social distancing will not allow for crowds in muggy tents. “A few weeks ago, we were still planning to deliver a physical festival this autumn,” says Sarah-Jane Roberts, the co-director of the Manchester literature festival . “But the ongoing uncertainties and concerns around the pandemic has made this more unlikely. We’re deeply disappointed, and though we’re resilient as a festival, and have a wonderful team of trustees and partnership organisations, we do worry about the next few years, and the long-term effects of losing a year box office.” The next months are, she believes, going be highly challenging for the festival community. Lots of action around events has moved online. Emma Corfield-Walters has got together with three other independents – Forum Books in Corbridge, Booka Books of Oswestry and Linghams, Heswall – to produce a series of events on Facebook Live (authors who have appeared so far include Robert Webb and Marian Keyes ). Today sees the conclusion of The Big Book Weekend , a virtual festival organised by writer Kit de Waal and Molly Flatt of the Bookseller , produced in association with BBC Arts, which featured author events, each of which should have taken place at a cancelled festival. But while these initiatives are spirited, popular and may sell books, there no ticket revenue in online. They are no substitute, either, for a shared experience; for the sound of applause and the prospect of a drink, a bun or a deckchair later. There light at the end of that tunnel, and the indies have been incredible, delivering books by skateboard and so on Jeremy Travathan, Macmillan Philip Jones has edited The Bookseller since “I’m often accused of being a Pollyanna when it comes to the trade,” he says. “But this period has challenged even me. Wherever you turn, something damaged.” What striking, however, is the positivity to be found almost everywhere. Sales have begun to recover. “The supermarkets and Amazon are getting back to normal,” says Jeremy Travathan. “There light at the end of that tunnel, and the indies have been incredible, delivering books by skateboard and so on. We kept on our sales reps, the better to support them. A great thing that has come out of this has to do with the ecosystem. In normal times, you’re negotiating to get the best deal you can. It can be tense and difficult. But now we’re working with retailers and printers to make sure they’re OK, while authors and agents are being incredibly thoughtful about things like cashflow. As a company, I don’t think we are nervous about the future. Commercial fiction is doing very well, but even in literary fiction, we don’t feel things are dire. We assume, like the government, that the market will be down this quarter, and in the third. But we predict that the fourth will be close to normal.” Funding for prizes is going to be a worry in the future, and literacy charities are going to find the landscape much more severe. “The arts are going to have to fight so hard,” says Jo Prior, who is chair of the Women prize for fiction and a trustee of the National Literacy Trust . “Corporate funding is going to be difficult to come by, and we haven’t even begun to see the impact on organisations like the NLT, which do so much brilliant work.” But – and this is surely the most significant point – there is a sense that this period has given many in the industry new perspectives (and, perhaps, a kick up the backside). For Stephen Page of Faber, for instance, working from home, about which he used to be sceptical, has caused him to think about how publishing might be more inclusive. “Town hall stuff is difficult [when people are at home],” he says. “But one thing that has occurred to us has to do with regionality. The vast majority of people who work at Faber now have to be able to get into the office [in Bloomsbury], but this experience shows people can work from anywhere – and a more distributed workforce means a more inclusive workforce. That an interesting thought.” The lockdown has also accelerated companies’ thinking about online. “We’re learning better to connect with readers,” says Prior. “We want our website to be more of a destination. People are loving our Penguin Perspectives series [in which the likes of Nick Hornby and Philip Pullman write about the issues of the day]. Publishers can introduce writers to people in an unmediated way: that has become real in this period, and I think it will be lasting.” Above all, this time of seclusion has put the book centre stage once again; it has not seemed so alive, or so vital, in many years. “People need stories,” says Kevin Duffy. “They take comfort in them.” He points to the success of Blue Moose Leonard and Hungry Paul by Rónán Hession, a novel about two ordinary men, and kindness. “People have told me that in lockdown this has been a balm for their souls. I get emails on a daily basis thanking me for it.” Beyond their anxiety, I sense in those I talk to a certain excitement; a recalibration of sorts. “The last four or five years in publishing have been great,” says Stephen Page. “We’re in mourning for them. But you can only dwell on that for a few moments before you say: the reading and the writing are still there. Original work will come out of this lockdown, just as it did out of austerity; it has shone a light on globalisation, and the inconveniences that we have, to a degree forgotten, like mortality.” He and I are talking via the screens of our laptops, and though his face keeps freezing, I can see how strongly he feels. “We are going to have change,” he says. “I feel sure this is a [permanently] changed environment. But my vocation as a publisher feels very central and important. Reading has had an exciting six weeks. It breathing for some people. Now we just have to figure out the next bit.”",3313
24,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/helen-garner-i-may-be-an-old-woman-but-im-not-done-for-yet,"hy did they ask me for an essay about stopping writing? And why did I say yes? Did I tell someone I’d stopped? Have I stopped? I could, if I wanted to, couldn’t I? I’m and I’m pretty tired. And lately I think I’ve copped what the French call “ un coup de vieux ”: a blow of old. I’ve got arthritis in my left wrist, my right knee gives twinges, and my left foot sometimes aches and stabs all day. Other days, nothing hurts at all. I don’t know what this means. I am an old woman. I’ve never written at home, because when I’m hanging round here I keep thinking up tasks, inventing housework, bargaining with my laziness: if I put on a load of washing, for example, minutes later I’ll be allowed to get up from the desk and hang it on the line. So I’ve always rented an office in another suburb, a drab room without wifi where there nothing to do except work. It spartan, my office; some people might call it grim. I like it very much. But I’m not going there today. It summer and the family gone away. I’m here on my own, without even the dog. My job is to guard the chooks and the vegetable garden. I know it neurotic, but I can’t go out. Somebody might break into the house. Junkies from the flats might climb the back fence and steal the bikes. A northerly might get up and tear the nets off the fruit trees. I have to stay home. Sensory fragments and self-doubt: drawing back the curtain on Helen Garner mind Right. The essay. I open the laptop at the kitchen table. Nothing happens. I copy out a ferocious quote from a Rachel Cusk essay I’m reading about the artist “inviolable selfishness in the face of other people needs”. Don’t want to think about that right now. I chew some sugarless gum and spit it into a torn envelope. I go to the broom cupboard and put on my apron: maybe that’ll make me feel businesslike. Maybe I’ll ask them to put an apron on my coffin, if I ever bloody well die. I turn on the radio. Norman Swan is saying that cognitive decline does not necessarily mean Alzheimer. How many years have I got left before I hit the age Mum was when she died of Alzheimer? Five years. Four and a bit. At that moment the bloke with the mower and the whipper-snipper charges through the back gate. Cheerfully he puts on his headphones and sets up his tremendous roar. Energised by the proximity of someone else manual labour, I start randomly rattling away on the keyboard. I may be an old woman, but I’m not done for yet. *** These days, when in the circumstances I am not getting much done, well-wishers think to comfort one by instancing what one has done already. This is no reassurance. One back-catalogue is more of a tribunal. One is arraigned before it and current work (or lack of it) judged. – Alan Bennett, in his London Review of Books diary. “No, I’m not working on anything.” “Nothing?” “No.” “You don’t want to talk about it?” “It not that. There nothing to tell. I’m not writing a book, that all.” “Oooh. That must be … uhmm … ” “Actually I’ve often gone for quite long periods without writing a book. Years, even.” “Really? But you published that one, that one about the, sorry, I forget its name, the dam one? The murder trial? That wasn’t very long ago, was it?” “Couple of years ago, yes.” “But haven’t you been at any interesting trials lately? Have you been at the court?” “No.” “But you love courts! I heard you say that in an interview! Or was it in a magazine?” “Yes. I do love courts.” “So there isn’t a trial that you’re interested in going to?” “Not right now, no.” *** Last year my ears started to pack up. If someone in conversation made a gesture that covered her mouth I would slap her hand away. In court I leaned forward, turned my head this way and that, strained in vain. I went to an audiologist. The tests were humiliating: I had to repeat sentences spoken by a voice that kept getting fainter and fainter until all I could say, miserably, over and over, was “No. No. No.” I got hearing aids. They cost an arm and a leg. In court they were no help at all. Too much ambient noise. The cop in front of me scratched his neck and I thought someone was sawing wood. Water gushed into a glass in a gurgling torrent. Counsel brilliant submissions were mouths opening and shutting and a harsh nasal stream of vowels. I spent a couple more days in the county and magistrates courts, striving and failing to follow, and emerged from that spectacle of weakness and woe with a broken heart and no story. That when I threw in the towel. My life as an amateur journalist was over. Months later I put on my overcoat and found in one of its pockets a small square of paper on which someone had neatly printed, “Helen Garner. Nail clipper x Tweezer x dated it and signed his name. It was the receipt from security at Broadmeadows magistrates court. My confiscated items must still be out there at Broadie, in a locker or a drawer. I’ll keep that slip of paper forever, to prove to myself that I really did try to keep going. *** Years ago, in one of those moments of self-hatred that can overcome a woman whose marriage is about to blow up in her face, I asked the man in my life if he thought I was lazy. “No,” he said coolly. “I think you’re a hard-working little money-making machine.” And I was. For years, between books, I wrote freelance journalism. I always had a deadline hanging over me and I loved it: it fed my anxiety, my driven nature. But the years went by, and I grew older. I became a hands-on grandmother. The work I had done began to amount to something. I had a backlist in print. I won a couple of generous awards. Money came to me from people who had died – my parents, and a woman who was a silent benefactor to me and to certain other artists of this country. The tight link between work and money loosened, and fell away. Now, when an editor offers me work, I don’t have to do it. I can open my mouth, and take a breath, and say no. At long last, I’m free. I’m out here, floating. This is the worst possible thing that could happen to a person like me. *** The thing about writing for publication is that it intimately connected with time. You’re always pointed at a future. Someone depending on you, waiting for you – probably tapping his foot and looking at his watch, breathing out sharply through his nose, only just holding back a roar of impatience. (My father? Still?) And if that deadline is removed, or so you think, everything will fracture, or go saggy and shapeless. How will I pass the day? Why will I get up in the morning? And what about the things that are swarming all around at me at every moment? Who going to see them, record them, save them from oblivion? How will the world continue to exist if I don’t keep writing about it? What I really mean is: How will I stay alive, if I stop writing? Oh, for God sake, woman, calm down. Mary Oliver has it covered: “What about all the little stones, sitting alone in the moonlight? … What about the grass?” Again and again she writes about learning to love the world. Is that what I’m trying to get at here? *** Last year I published Yellow Notebook (Text), a diary that I kept in the and Back then I never thought of it as publishable work. In fact I never thought of it as work at all. I wrote it to clear my head, to keep a record of things I didn’t want to forget, to calm myself before I went to sleep. But mostly I wrote it for the hell of it, because I really love writing. I mean, I love a pen and paper. I love words and sentences, and the way you can knit them together and shift them around and pile them up and spread them out. I love the way the raw material of an ordinary day doesn’t start to reveal its deeper meaning until you’ve got the pen in your hand and you’re halfway down the page. Someone remarked that a lot of the entries “could have been the starts of novels”. I’d had the same thought, while I was editing the old exercise books, and it surprised me. Often I asked myself why I had let this or that incident get past me, why I hadn’t followed it to wherever it might have led, and dug out its potential riches. But the force that draws a writer to one story rather than another does not tap politely at the front door. It shoots an invisible arrow into some murky region of the writer unknown needs, and hits a target she didn’t even know was there. That when the trouble starts. You have to believe, against the scornful trumpeting of your intellect, in the miraculous ability of form to create itself out of chaos. You have to hold the line through all the wretched days, months, even years that you spend not writing – doing anything but write: “wasting time”, indulging in displacement activities, wandering about pointlessly, biting people heads off, seething with anxiety and self-reproach. You have to believe that you’re preparing the ground for something to manifest out of the darkness, to present itself, to be born. Having already gone through this process countless times does not help. You forget, every single time, that it coming at you. The anxiety, the self-reproach are always total, unremitting, inescapable. You have to submit to it, allow yourself to suffer it, right to the end. How melodramatic it sounds. Almost laughable. But every writer I know would recognise that description, and shudder. So perhaps, after all, it would be a relief if it never came to me again, that sharp little secret arrow. Do I really miss it, or am I glad to be spared? Will I be spared? While I’m waiting for the answer, quietly growing wearier and achier and deafer, a great treasure is being offered to me daily, a humble glory on a platter, right here in front of me, under my nose. “Are you going to keep on writing about us?” says my grandson in the kitchen, dashing off the crossword that I have cursed and abandoned. “I don’t know.” I look up guiltily. “Would you rather I stopped?” A long pause. “No,” he says, with his philosophical smile. “I don’t think you should stop.” “Why not?” “Because,” butts in his brother, bouncing his football in a forceful rhythm, “it shows – that we – exist.” This is an edited extract from Helen Garner essay in Griffith Review Getting On",1897
25,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/25/tolstoy-steinbeck-defoe-why-are-so-many-turning-to-classic-novels,"here aren’t many aspects of the lockdown that the author Penelope Lively enjoys but reading Alice Adventures in Wonderland to her granddaughter on video calls is one of them. “We discovered that for some extraordinary reason she’d never read it in her childhood,” Lively says. “So we’re each taking it in turns to read a bit to each other – and thoroughly enjoying it.” Isolated in her home in north London, Lively, an widow, has also been scouring her own bookshelves for classic novels she can read alone. Currently, she is devouring all of the Irish writer William Trevor books: “I suddenly realised there was a lot of him I’d never read, and I’d almost forgotten how amazingly good he is.” For Lively, who is probably best known for her Booker prize-winning novel Moon Tiger , there is no better antidote to the lockdown than a classic novel. “It that old cliche of getting lost in a book. You want something that you can get immersed in, that takes you out of what is an extremely difficult time for all of us – and a lot of classic novels do that.” She should know. Lively is one of the few authors alive whose books are published as “modern classics” by Penguin. It is an honour she did not expect. “When I look back at the sort of ‘other person’ I was when I wrote Moon Tiger ... that person would certainly have been astonished to be told that, in years’ time, it would be seen as a classic.” . Penguin Classics saw a sales spike of during the week before lockdown, while bookshops were still open and people were stockpiling books.’To Lively, an author who describes her fiction as “trying to impose order upon chaos, to give structure and meaning to what is apparently random”, this comes as no surprise. “I think this period, if it doing nothing else, is probably making reading a more central part of people lives than before.” Fiction also offers an easy way to leave the lockdown behind. “Reading is always, in one sense, a form of escape,” says Lively. “It escaping into a life which is not the life that you’re actually having to live. That why we do it.” Lively has often followed the English tradition of saying serious things in a relatively lighthearted way. She recalls reaching for classic novels by other authors who did this – Elizabeth Bowen and Graham Greene – whenever she lacked insight into her feelings as a young woman. “We go to fiction to discover how fictional people in literature may have reacted to the same sort of experiences we have, such as loss and death – and love.” Personally, she is finding the lockdown “extremely depressing” and feels “very sorry” for the young, who are missing out on both job opportunities and the social life they should be having. “But I also feel sorry for my age group, because we’ve only got a few years left. And at least one of those years – possibly more – is being effectively taken away from us.” She has not found the pandemic conducive to writing, but does take comfort in her garden. She also makes time to read every day. With all forms of entertainment outside the home shut down, time-consuming classics seem more attractive than usual. Since the lockdown began, ebook downloads of War and Peace are up while sales of The Outsiders and Of Mice and Men have risen by more than “It interesting that they’re all rather sombre books, as though people are looking for books that reflect the sombre time that we’re in,” says Lively. “I’m a great believer in the sense that you can learn lessons from history. And that spills over into the reason that we read fiction and what we’re getting out of fiction. We’re experiencing a different slant on life. And that will affect how you then look at your own behaviour, and your own life.” I think this period, if it doing nothing else, is probably making reading a more central part of people lives than before This may be why people are turning to classic plague literature in droves: sales of the novel A Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe, about the Great Plague of London in are up by since the lockdown, while sales of The Decameron , a collection of stories set during the Black Death, have increased by according to Penguin. But there is also a trend of people turning to more optimistic classics about spring and nature. The Enchanted April , a novel by Elizabeth von Arnim about women reviving their marriages or finding love on the Italian Riviera, has seen sales rocket by nearly while demand for A Month in the Country by JL Carr has jumped Lively thinks the uplift in sales of classics suggests people are trying to spend their time productively. “They’re thinking: these books are always said to be amazing, now my opportunity to read them.” But not even she thinks it is possible to survive on a diet of classics alone. There is one other thing she recommends: “A glass of wine in the evening. That helps.” Four lockdown literary hits Middlemarch by George Eliot Audiobook sales up according to Penguin. Love, social change and marriage between incompatible people: it all here, in a small town in Victorian-era middle England.

26,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/25/normal-people-intimacy-coordinator-works-sally-rooney-sex-scenes,"t easy to forget just how much sex there is in Sally Rooney Normal People, when many of its greatest romantic beats are carried in a furtive glance or something left unsaid. But when putting the novel most intimate scenes between Marianne and Connell on screen, what was once a matter of lines on the page becomes minutes of closeups on flushed and sweaty skin. Every sex scene in the BBC much-anticipated adaptation, starting on Sunday, even the clumsiest teenage fumblings – a bra getting stuck over Marianne head, Connell tripping over his trousers – was carefully choreographed by Ita O’Brien, an “intimacy coordinator” who makes sure actors are comfortable while filming rumpy pumpy. Over the last decade, intimacy coordinators have become more commonplace on theatre, film and TV sets, particularly in the aftermath of Harvey Weinstein fall. Suddenly, producers and directors are falling over themselves to hire someone like O’Brien, who has worked on everything from Netflix Sex Education to HBO Watchmen and BBC Gangs of London. O’Brien, who has trained as a ballet dancer since she was three, and has worked as an actor herself, says she should be regarded as akin to a stunt coordinator. “I once called the role ‘intimacy director’, which was completely wrong, I made lots of directors very nervous,” she says. “But just like a stunt coordinator, I’m trying to improve communication, streamline production, serve the director vision and bring my skill of choreography and dance to the set.” On a normal day on Normal People, O’Brien would meet with the directors, Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald, then visit the actors, Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones, to check for any nerves. Then after quickly popping in to wardrobe to make sure they had enough genital guards, she’d head to set, making a plan for every significant moment in a scene, “where is a gaze, where is a touch, where does a no become a yes”. Once on set, “Daisy, Paul and I would talk through where they could touch each other, where they could kiss each other – as an example, in the early scenes Daisy had to wear a wig, so she had a rule about Paul not running fingers through her hair,” O’Brien explains. “While that might sound banal, it is really important because an actor doesn’t want to have to worry about that while filming sex, they want to be relaxed.” Then, when everyone is ready, time for a quick hug as an icebreaker – and filming can begin. In interviews, Edgar-Jones and Mescal have raved about O’Brien. “She the go-to,” Mescal told the Observer, while Edgar-Jones called her “brilliant … it was her job to worry about how it would work and we just turned up, did the choreography and carried on”. But director Lenny Abrahamson has cheerfully admitted that he was anxious about working with O’Brien, “because I thought the most subtle and important moments would be between me and the actors.” “But working with Ita, it was a lovely creative conversation and there was always a way in which they could say no. They were encouraged to talk about whether they felt OK or not. “It was never, ‘Will you do that?’” he told the Observer. O’Brien laughs: “I didn’t know that Lenny was sceptical when we first met. But he knew very quickly that I wasn’t there to get between him and Daisy or Paul. I’m there to provide some professional structure that hasn’t been there before.” Not all of her experiences are as happy as Normal People. She recalls one director shouting at his actors: “Give her a good rogering, harder, harder, harder!” (“I had to say, ‘Can we maybe pause and talk about penetration and the rhythm of intercourse?’” she said). And while demand for her skills is higher, O’Brien feels that she is often viewed as a tick box by producers and directors who want to be seen as observing best practice in the wake of #MeToo, but don’t want to provide it. “This year, more than ever, I’ve worked for producers who don’t actually want me there, who say to me, ‘Come in, get our nudity waivers ready and then stand back and do nothing’,” she says. She describes one set, where an actor asked for help while performing her first ever oral sex scene. “The director refused her a rehearsal and I stepped in and the director said, ‘Well, you’re directing now.’ It absolutely awful and the poor actors are then working in this terrible atmosphere. I’m still encountering this and it feels like I’m on the frontline of a war.” Rooney herself has likened sex scenes to just another form of dialogue; for O’Brien, the sex in Normal People “isn’t just there to show us sex – those scenes chart the delicacy, the beauty, the openness of this incredible, something-other relationship. It was crucial for me to honour Sally writing. There is nothing gratuitous. But there is also a lot of sex.” The first episide of Normal People screens on Monday at BST on BBC One .",847
27,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/15/alan-williams-obituary,"In Michael Frayn Fleet Street novel, Towards the End of the Morning , a smartarse graduate trainee scandalises a bunch of beery hacks by asking for a Pernod on his first visit to the paper local. The smart-arse prototype was the thriller writer Alan Williams, who has died aged Williams had just joined the Manchester Guardian from the Cardiff Western Mail. “I never really lived that pastis down,” he used to say. Williams had already pushed his luck more than once. In returning by train from a youth conference in Warsaw, he helped smuggle out a Polish student on the luggage rack. The following year, while still an undergraduate at King College, Cambridge, he delivered penicillin to Budapest during the Hungarian uprising, admitting afterwards that his real motive for going there was to witness a revolution at first hand. He also found time to climb Mount Etna – “my only outdoor sport” – and gaze into its crater, the first of many such ascents. Why? I once asked him. “Because it so incredibly dramatic. Like a glimpse of hell.” Predictably, Williams found provincial journalism rather tame, saying it was like “living on a plate of cold porridge”. In his spare time he wrote a thriller about the Algerian war, Long Run South To his surprise, since he had never been to North Africa, it became a bestseller. He left Manchester and “volunteered” to cover the Algerian war for the Daily Express. Some of his experiences there found their way into Williams second novel, Barbouze which introduced readers to one of his most baroque characters, Charles Pol, the Machiavellian Michelin man-lookalike who specialises in dirty tricks. Pol, in a subsequent book, Shah-Mak devises an ingenious method of assassinating a supposedly invulnerable Middle Eastern despot: the insertion of a lethal suppository during some kinky foreplay. Barbouze was written on a Mediterranean tramp steamer. When it docked at Beirut he went straight to the St George hotel, where all the journalists hung out. There was a drunk asleep at the bar. “That Kim Philby , the Observer chap,” he was told. “Spends most of his time like that.” The ship then called at Syria and Cyprus, but returned to Beirut shortly after a coup in Iraq. Somebody said to Williams, “Why don’t you jump ship and cover it for the Observer – their man hasn’t been seen since you were drinking here last.” It was assumed that Philby had gone on a bender whereas, in fact, he had gone for good. Williams did not replace Philby, but the double agent was the inspiration for arguably his best novel, Gentleman Traitor the climax of which has Philby, snugly ensconced in Ian Smith Rhodesia, drop dead as he is about to finger the Fourth Man. As Anthony Blunt, a leading art historian, had yet to be publicly exposed, Williams could not name him in the book; but in the copy he gave me he wrote: “Don’t be caught with this by Sir Anthony Blunt.” Before this, Williams had considered forging, with the help of a Russian chum, the diaries of Lavrenti Beria, Stalin depraved chief of secret police. Their plans were well advanced when the Clifford Irving -Howard Hughes scandal broke – Irving faked an autobiography of Hughes – whereupon Williams turned his scheme into a novel called The Beria Papers At one point his English protagonist, a sardonic hack called Mallory (said to be based on Williams journalist friend Nicholas Tomalin), is ejected from the birthday party thrown by a famous film star for his equally famous wife. This happened to Williams when he had the temerity to suggest to the actor Richard Burton that, since his party for Elizabeth Taylor was being held in Yugoslavia, it would have been polite to invite some Yugoslavs. The elder son of the actor and playwright Emlyn Williams and his wife, the actor Molly Shan, Williams was born in London, and educated at Stowe school, Buckinghamshire, and the universities of Grenoble, Heidelberg and Cambridge. His younger brother Brook followed his parents into acting, and was a close friend of Burton. Thrice married – “Women are an enigma as far as Grimes is concerned”, he would sigh, recalling the description of Evelyn Waugh immortal scapegrace in Decline and Fall – and for many years a heroic drinker, Williams could be difficult. Luckily his publisher, Anthony Blond , was tolerant of authors’ idiosyncrasies, which in Williams case included the need to try and live out his fantasies. Blond liked to relate how Williams had once defected to a rival imprint, only to return, “because there weren’t enough rows”. He later revealed that Williams was one of the few authors on his list who made any money. Naturally Williams could not resist going to Vietnam, the setting for his fourth novel, The Tale of the Lazy Dog Despite witnessing some of the big set-piece battles, he found the fighting less remarkable than the people who were covering it. He thought there was scope for another Scoop , since “a bigger bunch of more certifiable maniacs it would be hard to imagine”. He also helped his friend Nicholas Bethell smuggle into the west the manuscript of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn novel, Cancer Ward, fictionalising this exploit in The Beria Papers. Writing fiction did not come easily to him. He used to complain of the awful difficulties involved in simply getting a character on and off the plane. Even so it was a surprise when, after years on the job, he suddenly dried up. At about the same time he also, on doctor orders, stopped drinking. The link between drink and ink was never established. But according to Williams third wife, the literary agent Maggie Noach , it was the collapse of communism that silenced him for good. What was there left to write about once the cold war had been won? Fortunately, Williams had a lucrative hobby. He built detailed working models of windmills, which were sold in the US for five figure sums. He also inherited money from his father, which enabled him to meet his varied domestic commitments. A short, wiry figure with a tousled look, Williams inherited a “stagey” voice from his father and a talent for mimicry that gave resonance to the anecdotes he never tired of telling about espionage and those who practised it. For many years after he and Maggie divorced, he divided his time between the Chelsea Arts Club and a tiny flat in Holland Park, west London, which he shared with a cat called The General. Williams is survived by Sophie, his daughter withMaggie, Owen and Laura, the children of his second marriage, to Antonia Simpson, and three grandchildren, Roxy, Willow and Fox.

28,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/sep/26/walter-benjamins-legacy-75-years-on,"Like many a refugee in southern and central Europe today, Walter Benjamin was in flight from war and persecution years ago, but was blocked at an intermediate border en route to the country chosen as his haven. He was part of a Jewish group which, hoping to escape occupied France, had hiked through a Pyrenean pass in autumn with a view to entering Franco Spain, crossing it to&nbsp;Portugal and then sailing to the US.&nbsp;However, in the words of Hannah Arendt , they arrived in the frontier village of Portbou “only to learn that Spain had closed the border that same day” and officials were not honouring American visas such as Benjamin. Faced with the prospect of returning to&nbsp;France and being handed over to the Nazis, he “took his own life” overnight on September, whereupon the officials “allowed his companions to proceed to Portugal”. My hero: Walter Benjamin by Elif Shafak For Arendt, who successfully reached New York via his intended route a few months later, this was a tragedy of misunderstanding, a poignant but fitting end for a brilliant but misfortune-prone older relative (her cousin by marriage) whom she writes about with a kind of affectionate exasperation. Yet Edward Stourton , in Cruel Crossing: Escaping Hitler Across the Pyrenees , notes “there are all sorts of unanswered questions surrounding Benjamin death. His travelling companions remembered him carrying a heavy briefcase containing a manuscript he described as ‘more important than I am’. No such manuscript was found after his death … A Spanish doctor report gave the cause of death as a cerebral haemorrhage, not a drugs overdose. There has been persistent speculation that he was actually murdered, perhaps by a Soviet agent who had infiltrated his escaping party.” By the time Arendt wrote her memoir (later used as the introduction to Illuminations ) in the chaotic freelance critic she evoked, pinballing between temporary homes, disparate obsessions and the incompatible views of his friends Adorno , Brecht and Gershom Scholem , was fast emerging a&nbsp;la Orwell as a giant figure with an unexpectedly substantial estate in print - his collected writings were published in Germany in eventually followed by a four-volume Harvard edition in English - and formative power in multiple fields. For devotees of Critical Theory, he is&nbsp;now seen as one of the founding fathers along with his sterner Frankfurt School associates Adorno, Horkheimer and Marcuse , having helpfully transcended mere wittering about paintings, books and Mickey Mouse by also sketching a philosophy of history. For Terry Eagleton , he is a&nbsp;model for “revolutionary criticism” of literature and the media. And, almost as a hobby, he is the inspirational linkman between the flâneur and today psychogeographers, by virtue of his portraits of cities in “One Way Street” and the vast, unfinished Arcades Project , a love letter to a dying Paris. John Berger made him the guru of radical readings of the visual arts by drawing on The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction in the first programme and chapter of his seminal TV series and book Ways of Seeing . The same essay, plus his writings on photography, film, children literature and porn, also ensured Benjamin status as the patron saint of&nbsp;cultural studies, which in the seeped into journalism and started to shape a less sniffy but still intelligent approach to pop culture. And it this legacy that Alex Ross singled out in a fine New Yorker article last year on the Benjamin-Adorno “mutual admonition society”, pointing to the pervasive influence of the Frankfurt approach (“when online recappers expend thousands of words debating the depiction of rape in Game of Thrones ”) and the enhanced contemporary relevance of Benjamin key text: “The essay governing question, about what it means to create or consume art when any work of art can be mechanically reproduced, has grown ever more pressing in the digital age, when Bach complete cantatas or the Oxford English Dictionary can be downloaded in moments.”",660
29,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations,"Ninety years ago this month, the fourth edition of Ford Madox Ford Transatlantic Review came out. It featured the first new work to be published by James Joyce since Ulysses in The modestly titled, eight-page piece, From Work in Progress was the beginning of a project that was to be, if anything, even more scandalous and divisive than its predecessor. In the years between this first fleeting appearance and the eventual publication of Finnegans Wake on May, Joyce book was to alienate long-time supporters such as Ezra Pound and attract a younger generation of writers, critics and publishers, including Samuel Beckett, Eugene Jolas, Robert McAlmon and Stuart Gilbert. In the years since its publication, the Wake has lived something of a double life. On the one hand, it has been a darling of academia, lending itself to exegesis as few other novels do. On the other, it has baffled generations of ordinary readers, even those who admire and enjoy Joyce earlier writing. As a result, it has gained a reputation as a book more written about than read, the ultimate in modernist incomprehensibility. It has almost become a badge of middlebrow honour to declare to the world that you have never, and will never, read the thing. There is an annotated version online that led me to think that the book is like an early iteration of hypertext And yet. The fact is that anything that is written can be read, if you go at it in the right way. Many of the book admirers have suggested that the right way to approach the Wake is to see it as oral as much as literary. As Jolas put it: “Those who have heard Mr Joyce read aloud from Work in Progress know the immense, rhythmic beauty of his technique. It has a musical flow that flatters the ear, that has the organic structure of works of nature, that transmits painstakingly every vowel and consonant formed by his ear.” Joyce himself lent some credence to this approach by recording a section from the Anna Livia Plurabelle chapter at the Orthological Institute at Cambridge in in his best cod-Irish brogue. Forty years later, Irish folk group the Dubliners, who owe their name to the fact that singer Luke Kelly was reading Joyce short stories when they needed one, went one better by recording The Ballad of Persse O’Reilly , a “scurrilous rann against HC Earwicker” that appears early in the novel. Most impressively of all, in the Irish writer Patrick Healey recorded the whole thing; hours of audio recorded over a four-day period in Bow Lane recording studios, Dublin. Since the Wake went out of copyright in the EU in there has been a perceptible shift. For one thing, there are now more print editions available to compete with the standard Faber text, whose pagination serves as the bedrock that supports the weight of critical interpretation that has grown around the work. These range from a reasonably priced Wordsworth Classics paperback to a somewhat pricier, but beautifully illustrated, Folio Society printing . Closer to Jolas oralist approach, the Irish actor Olwen Fouéré brought a chunk of it to the stage . You can even take a Wake walk in Dublin Phoenix Park . More interestingly, the move to the public domain meant that the Wake could more easily enter the world beyond print culture. There is an excellent annotated version of the text online which, when I discovered it, led me to think that the book, like other supposedly difficult modernist texts such as Eliot The Waste Land and The Cantos of Ezra Pound, is like an early iteration of hypertext. The book was, we can now see, crying out for the invention of the web, which would enable the holding of multiple domains of knowledge in the mind at one time that a proper reading requires. The web, too, has taken to Finnegans Wake with open arms. There a Twitter account, @finnegansreader, which is dedicated to tweeting the entire text, characters or fewer at a time. With followers, it no One Direction, but it shows a healthy level of interest in a supposedly unreadable book. Another, @FW_WOTD, tweets daily definitions of Wake words; it even more popular. Stephen Crowe, a Seattle-based illustrator, is working his way through a more thoroughgoing reimagining of the Wake on his Wake in Progress site. It an ongoing, image-by-image recreation of Joyce book as a kind of graphic novel. A project as insanely ambitious as this could only take shape online; print would be both too inflexible for Crowe slow pace and too expensive. Another Wake project that has been made possible by digital technology is taking shape over at Waywords and Meansigns . The musicians involved in this project are putting together a collaborative musical version of the whole book with samples from the final work on the site already. The complete setting will be available, free, on May, to mark the anniversary of the book first publication. So, is the web changing our perception of Joyce late masterpiece? I’m a dedicated lover of the printed word, but perhaps Finnegans Wake needed the web to become easily readable. Maybe Joyce multiple concurrent layers of meaning and rejection of linearity need hypertext and online reading habits to open them up to a wider audience. And maybe, just maybe, future generations will look back on early discussions of Finnegans Wake unreadability and wonder what the hell was the matter with us.",914
30,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/22/100-best-novels-sun-also-rises-ernest-hemingway-robert-mccrum,"n Woody Allen Midnight in Paris , Corey Stoll makes a scene-stealing appearance as the young Ernest Hemingway, tough-guy modernist and friend of Gertrude Stein. It a cameo grounded in the truth that, for one of America greats, Paris in the was a source of artistic liberation. It was also the setting for the first section of Hemingway first, and best, novel (published in the UK as Fiesta ). The novel, a roman à clef describing an anguished love affair between the expatriate American war veteran Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley, a femme fatale representative in the writer mind of womanhood, is mostly located in Spain, Hemingway favourite country. For some critics, the heart of the novel is the bullfight, and how each character responds to the experience of the corrida . At the same time, the escape into the wild is a great American theme that recurs in the works of Hawthorne, Melville, and Twain (Nos and in this series). In addition, The Sun Also Rises , like most novels of the is a response to the author recent wartime service. The key to Hemingway, the thing that unlocks the most important doors to his creative life, was a deeper, more personal darkness, his complicated experience of the first world war. There are two versions. Either he was rejected for poor eyesight; or he failed to enlist and instead joined up as an ambulance driver. Each way, in the short-term, he was wounded by the shame of rejection and cowardice. However, once with the Red Cross, Hemingway got as badly injured as if he’d been in combat. Thereafter, throughout his life, he craved the company of risk-takers – bullfighters or big-game hunters – and longed to be accepted by them. Courage, cowardice and manly authenticity in extremis became his themes. Perhaps this is also the inspiration for his famously hard-boiled prose. The best of Hemingway fiction, at its purest and most influential, is found in his stories, but this first novel is also a literary landmark that earns its reputation as a modern classic. A note on the text Hemingway began writing the novel with the working title of Fiesta on his birthday, in He completed the draft manuscript about eight weeks later, in September, and went on to revise it further during the winter of The novel is based on a trip he made from Paris to Pamplona, Spain in with his wife, Hadley Richardson, and the American writer John Dos Passos. Hemingway returned again in with another group of American and British expats. Their experiences and complex romantic entanglements became absorbed into the manuscript of The Sun Also Rises . In the US, Scribner published the novel on Its first edition, just over copies, sold well. The Hellenistic-style cover illustration by Cleonike Damianakes showed a seated, robed woman, head bent, eyes closed, shoulders and thigh exposed. Hemingway editor, the celebrated Maxwell Perkins, wrote that “Cleon respectably sexy” artwork was designed to attract “the feminine readers who control the destinies of so many novels”. Within two months, The Sun Also Rises was in a second printing, with many subsequent printings to follow. In the novel was published in the UK by Cape under the title Fiesta . In fact, The Sun Also Rises has been in print continuously since its publication in and is said to be one of the most translated titles in the world.

31,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/30/us-publishing-american-dirt-survey-diversity-cultural-appropriation,"As the controversial novel American Dirt raises questions about representation for US publishing, a survey has found that – despite efforts to diversify – the industry “is just as white today as it was four years ago”. Multicultural children publisher Lee &amp; Low Books last surveyed the sector in when it found that of respondents identified as white. Four years on, after raising the number of responses to it found that were white . “Given the sample size difference, this change in white employees does not meet the bar for statistically significant change,” said the survey authors. “In other words, the field is just as white today as it was four years ago.” Seven per cent of respondents described themselves as “Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander”, with “Hispanic/Latino/Mexican”, “black/African American” and “biracial/multiracial” at Native Americans and Middle Easterners each comprise less than of publishing staff. “At a time when readers of all backgrounds were demanding to see themselves in books, the publishing industry came nowhere near to reflecting the rich diversity of the US,” concludes the report. “The people behind the books serve as gatekeepers, who can make a huge difference in determining which stories are amplified and which are shut out. If the people who work in publishing are not a diverse group, how can diverse voices truly be represented in its books?” The authors welcomed a drop in the proportion of white executives from in to “since true change in company culture almost always requires buy-in from the very top”. But the numbers of white people in editorial roles increased from to “so, even though more diverse books are being published now, it fair to assume that the majority of them are still being acquired and edited by white people”. The most diverse group in publishing was found to be interns, with identifying as black, indigenous or people of colour. “The encouraging numbers in the intern section indicate that publishing is trying to reach out to diverse populations,” the report continues. “But keeping diverse employees engaged and believing they have a home in this industry is another matter. Without a clear career path and the promise of opportunities for a bright future, retention will continue to be a serious problem, and the needle will not move.” “I think maybe some white people will be surprised by the numbers,” said Lee &amp; Low publicity director Hannah Ehrlich, “but I don’t think many people of colour in the industry will.” “For these numbers to change in a meaningful way would require top-down cultural shifts across our industry,” she added, “something that I don’t think we’ve really seen yet, as well as the removal of many socioeconomic barriers to entry into the field.” Publisher cancels Jeanine Cummins tour for American Dirt over safety fears The Lee &amp; Low report appeared the same day that the publisher of Jeanine Cummins’ controversial novel American Dirt cancelled the rest of her book tour citing concerns about safety. Cummins is of Irish and Puerto Rican background, and received a seven-figure advance for her story, which has also been selected for Oprah book club. The book has been accused by Mexican-American writers of stereotypical portrayals of Mexico and Mexicans, with more than writers from diverse backgrounds now writing an open letter to Oprah asking that she reconsider her choice . “I don’t want to comment on any one book or publisher,” Ehrlich said, “but I think that the extremely homogeneous nature of our industry workforce leaves publishers vulnerable to all sorts of mistakes, missteps, and failures … Without a diverse workforce behind the scenes, publishers cannot really have the awareness or cultural competency to do justice to diverse stories.” American Dirt happened because the veneer of progressivism remains valued far higher than the action of it For the Eisner &amp; Ignatz award-winning cartoonist Shivana Sookdeo, who called for publishers to prioritise marginalised creators in a series of tweets that went viral , the link was all too clear. “To me, American Dirt didn’t just happen because there not enough, say, Latinx representation in the publishing workforce,” she said. “American Dirt happened because the veneer of progressivism remains valued far higher than the action of it. Without support for the marginalised already within publishing, from living wages to protection from backlash, you can’t attract more. Without that growth of the workforce, you can’t effectively safeguard against exploitative works. Without those safeguards, you make it even more inhospitable for diverse talent. Then you’re back at square one publishing establishment, safe, whiter voices because the entire chain has been neglected.” She felt that while there will “always be American Dirts”, what she is waiting to see “is an industry that prioritises stories about brown people from those people, far above that of white authors telling it for them”. The report urges the publishing industry to examine how companies can be more welcoming to diverse staff, and to ensure all staff receive proper training. “Until we all start to care about equity, we will not make progress, and any gains the industry makes will continue to be not statistically significant,” the report declares. “A lot has happened in four years, and not all of it for the better. Four years from now, what will the next baseline survey show us? And what will those numbers tell us about ourselves?”",887
32,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/07/polly-samson-books-interview-the-kindness,"t is five years since Polly Samson published a book, and she wrote her new one, The Kindness , through what she calls “horrible times”. Two years ago her father, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany who came to England on the Kindertransport as a boy in died in hospital in “utterly miserable” circumstances after a&nbsp;mistakenly prescribed double dose of&nbsp;antibiotics destroyed his liver. The year before that, Samson friend, the journalist Cassandra Jardine, died of lung cancer. And the year before that, Samson eldest son Charlie went to prison after admitting “violent disorder” for his part in an attack on Topshop that&nbsp;followed the tuition fee protests of&nbsp;December during which he was pictured on the bonnet of Prince Charles car and hanging from a flag on the Cenotaph. At times she found it difficult to focus on anything else. The first draft of the story that grew into The Kindness was framed by an account of a prison visit. Then there was a plan for an intriguing combination of novella and linked short stories. But over the course of the&nbsp;miles-long walks she takes from her house on a bustling corner of the sea front at Hove, Samson gathered her&nbsp;material together and stitched it into the densely plotted, dynamic domestic thriller – with an English idyll of ivy-covered house, meadow and hammock on the cover – that is sitting on the coffee table in front of us. “It the most gleeful sort of writing there is,” she says from the large sofa where she is smoking roll-ups and looking out to sea. “For days I’d be thinking, how does this happen? How do the characters not know this information or how do we not know it? All those technical problems. That the thing about walking – or sleeping, it the same – it&nbsp;just solves them and then you&nbsp;can’t wait to get back to the top of&nbsp;the house.” I had no access to my&nbsp;Jewish family but finding out about them has given me a stronger sense of who I am By coincidence, following the triumph of Helen Macdonald memoir H Is for Hawk , The Kindness opens with a falconry scene, but swiftly moves indoors to trace the contours of grief. Julian has lost both partner Julia and daughter Mira, and is stuck in a country house with their ghosts, his overbearing mum and needy former girlfriend. From empty picture frames and beds the novel moves backwards, to the couple ever-so-romantic beginnings, their grotty L-shaped flat, and the accidental pregnancy and miscarriage that preceded Mira. On a whim, we learn, Julian moved the family back to his picturesque childhood home, Firdaws. Then childhood cancer struck: blood tests, scans, tubes, “pale, curdy sick”. The novel is contemporary but deeply indebted to the past. Samson grandmother used to say the family lost “just two aunts” in the Holocaust, but since her father death, and aided by a trunk of papers she inherited, Samson has become obsessed with piecing together the truth. In particular she is interested in&nbsp;her great-uncle Heino, who killed himself in the and whose black-and-white photograph of painter Mark Rothko sits behind her on a shelf. The feelings of living people mean she must be careful what she reveals, but she has drawn on&nbsp;family secrets in The Kindness and recently went to Paris to meet the woman Heino loved in later life. “My father was from Hamburg and most of his family got out, but like a lot of people he didn’t want to talk about Germany, the war or the Holocaust,” she says. “It was sealed off, and when we went to live in Cornwall” – in when she&nbsp;was eight – “ties were pretty much severed with everyone except my grandmother. I had no access to my&nbsp;Jewish family at all but they did all the things I do – they wrote, they took pictures – and finding out about them has given me a much stronger sense of who I am.” Samson husband is David Gilmour , the musician, best known for being in&nbsp; Pink Floyd , with whom she has two sons and a daughter. Gilmour, who her senior, has&nbsp;four adult children from his first marriage and Samson son Charlie also comes from a previous relationship, though Gilmour adopted him. They are a modern blended family, but what is striking about Samson background is&nbsp;that this&nbsp;is nothing new. Second and&nbsp;third marriages and webs of siblings go back&nbsp;at least two generations to her grandmother, an East End&nbsp;chambermaid of Jewish or Romany origins who&nbsp;married the scion of a well-to-do Shanghai family but was sent back to England following the Japanese invasion, leaving her husband to start&nbsp;again. Samson mother Esther was six at the time, and she and her brothers went first to a children home and then to what Samson calls “pretty scary foster parents”. She survived to fall in with a&nbsp;group of Spanish communist students, marry a Chinese-American war hero and smuggle herself to China. There, she found a set of half-siblings, though not her father, and stayed for years, serving in the Red Army and working as an interpreter for journalists including the Daily Worker Alan Winnington, who became her second husband. Samson parents met in East Berlin, when the British Communist party gave her father the job of trying to get Winnington out of China, where he was stuck without a passport. They fell&nbsp;in love and had Polly before marrying in but Winnington remained a&nbsp;long-distance member of the family, with his son and Esther child by her previous relationship brought up with Polly, who grew up calling her biological father “Lance” and Winnington “Daddy”. Asked whether her first novel, Out of the Picture which she dedicated to Charlie and is all about a young woman attempts to reconnect with her absent artist-father, expressed the hope that Charlie might in some way reconnect with his own lost parent, the&nbsp;poet Heathcote Williams , Samson says she wonders if the book wasn’t more about herself. Contact with Winnington, the second father of her early years, suddenly stopped: “No one thought I might have a yearning and looking back now I&nbsp;think I did.” She later learned he had kept one of her baby shoes all his life. Samson parents stuck with the Communist party through the Soviet invasion of Czechslovakia and gave up their membership quietly in the Her father went from the Daily Worker (now the Morning Star) to the Packet group of local newspapers in Cornwall, where her half-Chinese mother became head of a village school. “My parents very much enjoyed each other company and didn’t really need anyone else,” she says. “We lived in an old tin-mining village that even people in the next town had never heard of. They didn’t have a lot of friends or do&nbsp;much socialising. Maybe they just wanted a rest.” Samson had virtually dropped out of school but at her grandmother urging she moved to London and got a secretarial job in publishing, from where she rose to become head publicist at Jonathan Cape. She began a relationship with Williams, moved back to Cornwall and in had their son. When Williams walked out, Samson returned to London in a “terrible state” and was offered a&nbsp;place to stay by Jardine, a virtual stranger who became a close friend. She married Gilmour five years later, only deciding she believed in marriage as they arrived at Marylebone town hall. Today they preside over their “huge tribe of children” and the vast German shepherd she got from a rescue home at&nbsp;the height of her anxiety about Charlie incarceration. She has taken up smoking again, suffers from stage fright so&nbsp;acute that she takes beta-blockers before public appearances, and&nbsp;travels to London each week to see&nbsp;a&nbsp;psychotherapist. A “really, really secret writer” for many years, Samson wrote her first novel in six weeks because she wanted it finished before her short stories came&nbsp;out and bad reviews crushed her&nbsp;confidence. In the event critics were enthusiastic: her new novel has received much advance praise and she has moved to a new publisher after a&nbsp;prolonged courtship. At Gilmour urging she also revealed herself as his lyricist, and lights up with excitement when she plays me rough versions of a&nbsp;couple of tracks on his forthcoming album. One was inspired by book two of Paradise Lost ; another by a painting on the wall above the fireplace. Samson suffered a pang about her&nbsp;own lack of education when she delivered her son Charlie to Cambridge. She struggled in her she says, when “everyone else had a gang from university”. Reading Paradise Lost , which features in her novel as well as Gilmour song, she thought: “I would love to be going to lectures. I would love someone to set me an essay on this.” When stuck with her writing she took to spending long days at the piano, having begun lessons to help her children before deciding to take the&nbsp;exams herself. Her last book of short stories had the&nbsp;ironic title Perfect Lives . Since then Samson has had what she calls “about the most horrible experience of my life”, visiting her son in prison: “They make it&nbsp;about as unpleasant as they can. The&nbsp;glass is smeared with semen and&nbsp;you speak through a kind of box.

33,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy,"Few writers kept their work as close to the subject of death as did Albert Camus , one of the greatest novelists and essayists of the century, who met his own end in a road accident years ago this week, on the Lyon-Paris Route Nationale Of all Camus’ novels, none described man confrontation – and cohabitation – with death so vividly and on such an epic scale as La Peste, translated as The Plague. Most of us read The Plague as teenagers, and we should all read it again. And again: for not only are all humankind responses to death represented in it, but now – with the advent of Ebola – the book works on the literal as well as metaphorical level. Camus’ story is that of a group of men, defined by their gathering around and against the plague. In it we encounter the courage, fear and calculation that we read or hear in every story about West Africa efforts to curtail and confront Ebola; through its narrator, Dr Rieux, we can identify with the hundreds of Cuban doctors who went immediately to the plague Ground Zero, and those such as the Scottish nurse currently fighting for her life at the Royal Free Hospital in London. I think Camus intended such a literal – as well as allegorical - reading. It is generally agreed that the pestilence he describes signifies the Third Reich. Writing in as the world whooped victory and “Never Again”, Camus insisted that the next plague “would rouse up its rats again” for “the bane and enlightenment of men”. But Camus was also aware of the great cholera epidemic in Oran, Algeria – where the novel is set – in and of others in his native district of Mondovi in the Algerian interior. But there is another reason we should all re-read La Peste (preferably in French or the English translation by Stuart Gilbert , a work of literature in itself). Like every good metaphorical or allegorical work, it can represent beyond its intentions; including pestilences both moral and metaphorical that have happened after Camus’ own lifetime. The critic John Cruikshank insists that La Peste is also a reflection on “man metaphysical dereliction in the world”, in which case the applications are endless, and up to us. So it is worth reflection on this anniversary of his death: what would the plague signify now? Nowadays, I think, La Peste can tell the story of a different kind of plague: that of a destructive, hyper-materialist, turbo-capitalism; and can do so as well as any applied contemporary commentary. In fact especially so, for this reason: the Absurd. Our society is absurd, and Camus’ novel examines – among many other things, and for all its moralising – our relationship to the absurdity of modern existence. It can describe very well the plague in a society which blares its phantasgmagoria across the poor world so that millions come, aboard tomb ships or across murderous deserts, in search of its empty promises; and which even destroys the constant against which Camus measured human mortality: nature. Essential to Camus’ existential isolation was the discrepancy between the power and beauty of nature, and the desolation of the human condition. From his earliest days, he loved the sea and deserts, and saw man mortality in the light of their indifferent vastness. The master of the absurd, Samuel Beckett, was born seven years before Camus, but was active in the French resistance at the same time. In Beckett Happy Days, Winnie meditates that “Sometimes it is all over for the day, all done, all said, all ready for the night, and the day not over, far from over, the night not ready, far from ready”. In this place, as in the wait for Godot, there is no purposeful human agency. In La Peste, however, absurdity is a source of value, values and even action. The group of men gathered around the narrative represent, it feels, all human response to calamity. Each takes his turn to tell it, although it is the doctor, Rieux – the hidden narrator – who battles the pestilence with his work, medicine, just as Camus tried to battle first injustice, later fascism, with his labour in words. The difference from Beckett is this: as the hunter for Beckett Molloy concludes: “Then I went back to the house and wrote. It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining” – ergo, even the narration is self-negating. But Camus’ characters in La Peste illustrate that, although they know they are powerless against plague, they can bear witness to it, and this is in itself of value. When he accepted the Nobel prize for literature in Camus’ magnificent speech urged that it was the honour and burden of the writer “to do so much more than write”. Camus saw no dichotomy between the emptiness which lies at the heart of L’Etranger, and the endeavours of La Peste. He wrote once about “the wine of the absurd and the bread of indifference which will nourish [man] greatness”. The fact of absurd powerlessness is no reason not to act; Camus, for all his deep sense of the absurd, urges us to action. But there was no moral place for humankind in nature. The distance of nature power and beauty is almost a form of torture: in Camus’ first major novel, La Mort Heureuse , Mersault ponders the “inhuman beauty of the April morning”. Only one letter separates Mersault name from that of his more complex and ambiguous sucessor, Meursault, anti-hero of L’Etranger: he is a man of many questions but no answers. Yet even Meursault deduces that in killing an Arab on the beach: “I understand that I had destroyed the harmony of the day”. But why does La Peste speak so loudly to us now? Camus wrote early on, in an essay entitled Le Desert, about “repugnant materialism”. He was on a track of vital import to us now, in a world of materalism so repugnant it has become a plague. Everything mankind does in a turbo-capitalist age, with his ravaging of nature, “destroys the harmony of the day”. Every bleat of the politicians echoes those in authority during Camus’ fictitious plague in Oran: “There are no rats in the building”, insists the janitor as they die around him. The newspapers rally the populace with news that the pestilence is under control when it is not. Camus offers us a way of abandoning our pointless quest for “oneness” with ourselves, but carrying on nevertheless, fighting: For some ill-defined moral justice, even though we have ceased to be able to define it. At the conclusion to La Peste, Rieux – whose wife has died of illness elsewhere, unconnected with the pestilence – watches families and lovers reunite when the gates of Oran are finally opened. He wonders – in the wake of so much suffering and pointless struggle – whether there can be peace of mind or fulfilment without hope, and concludes that yes, perhaps there can, for those “who knew now that if there is one thing one can always yearn for, and sometimes attain, it is human love”. These are the people “whose desires are limited to man, and his humble yet formidable love” and who “should enter, if only now and again, into their reward”. But Rieux has already qualified these words before he has written them, a few lines earlier. “But for those others”, he says, “who aspired beyond and above the human individual towards something they could not even imagine, there had been no answer”. No answer. No description, even, of what that “something” else might be. And yet it nags, it makes demands of us, and those who identify with Rieux know what it is, though we have abandoned a definition. Pointless, but imperative; political to a degree, but impatient with politics; moral certainly, but uneasily – and with serious regard to that vastness in nature against which our mortality measures itself, but which we are now killing. Something to ponder further, then - as I did as I drove on Sunday up what is now Autoroute between Lyon and Paris with a little trepidation on the anniversary itself, past Villeblevin, where the Facel Vega sports car driven by Camus’ friend Michel Gallimard crashed both men to their deaths.",1399
34,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/25/malorie-blackman-time-is-right-for-bbc-noughts-and-crosses-drama,"The bestselling author and former children laureate Malorie Blackman has said she hopes the forthcoming BBC adaptation of her critically acclaimed series Noughts and Crosses will open up a more nuanced debate on race in the UK. With the subject permeating the critically acclaimed dystopian fiction series, Blackman, told Radio Times the TV adaptation was being released at a time when it could make a bigger impact than when it was first announced four years ago. “Now, there the realisation that diverse stories do make money, like the films Black Panther and Hidden Figures – it would once have been much harder to get them off the ground. “There an audience desperate for new content and new voices and I think a lot of people are waking up to that.” In the opening episode of the series, where Europe has been colonised by Africa and the ruling classes (the Crosses) are black and the white population (the Noughts) are the slaves, the white characters’ names are mispronounced, plasters are dark brown and white people serve people of colour at a party. “It all based on true stuff,” said Blackman, who was told at school that black people did not go to university and often wondered as a youngster why plasters were only ever pink. “The things he [Callum] goes through particularly in school happened to me, like asking my teachers where the black scientists were on the curriculum and being told there weren’t any. Or my first time in first class on a train and being accused of stealing the ticket.” The London-born author, whose parents came from Barbados, rejected Laurence Fox claim that the term “white privilege” was racist, saying it did not erase the experiences of white people in the world who are struggling. “Of course it doesn’t mean that, it just means that one of the things you are being judged on is not your skin colour. In my life when I’ve flown, only once in the last years have I not been called over by customs to search my bags.” She revealed she had made a note of all the headlines comparing Kate Middleton to Meghan Markle and was frustrated and saddened at denials that race has played a part in the media differential treatment of the Duchess of Sussex. When Kate was pregnant she was “tenderly touching her baby bump”, she said, “but when Meghan did it, she was ‘just doing it for attention’. Kate wore an off-the-shoulder dress to an event and was described as stunning, but when Meghan wore one – and as far as I could see the only difference was the colour [of the dress] – she was called vulgar … It was nasty.” Asked her thoughts on racial fluidity and whether somebody could just “feel black”, she said: “It a tricky one. I believe in gender fluidity and that you can be born in the wrong body. With race, you can admire someone culture, but if you’re not born into it … “Can I, for example, just turn around and say I am an Inuit because that how I want to identify? There more to it than that, it about being brought up in the culture. It an interesting thing to explore, maybe I’ll try and write a story about it!” Blackman autobiography is due to be published by #Merky Books, founded by Stormzy, who has a cameo in the series. In one episode he plays a newspaper editor, a role created especially for him. She felt positive that sensibilities like colour-blind casting in TV and film were beginning to catch up with the times. “That why I loved the recent BBC adaptation of A Christmas Carol when Mary Cratchit was played by Vinette Robinson. “Some people complained that a woman of colour was playing her – they had no problems when Miss Piggy played the part though, did they?”",650
35,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/22/le-carre-call-for-the-dead,"hen Lady Ann Sercomb married George Smiley towards the end of the war she described him to her astonished Mayfair friends as breathtakingly ordinary. When she left him two years later in favour of a Cuban motor racing driver, she announced enigmatically that if she hadn't left him then, she never could have done; and Viscount Sawley made a special journey to his club to observe that the cat was out of the bag. This remark, which enjoyed a brief season as a mot, can only be understood by those who knew Smiley. Short, fat, and of a quiet disposition, he appeared to spend a lot of money on really bad clothes, which hung about his squat frame like skin on a shrunken toad. Sawley, in fact, declared at the wedding that 'Sercomb was mated to a bullfrog in a sou'wester'. And Smiley, unaware of this description, had waddled down the aisle in search of the kiss that would turn him into a Prince. Was he rich or poor, peasant or priest? Where had she got him from? The incongruity of the match was emphasized by Lady Ann undoubted beauty, its mystery stimulated by the disproportion between the man and his bride. But gossip must see its characters in black and white, equip them with sins and motives easily conveyed in the shorthand of conver­sation. And so Smiley, without school, parents, regiment or trade, without wealth or poverty, travelled without labels in the guard van of the social express, and soon became lost luggage, destined, when the divorce had come and gone, to remain unclaimed on the dusty shelf of yesterday news. When Lady Ann followed her star to Cuba, she gave some thought to Smiley. With grudging admiration she admitted to herself that if there were an only man in her life, Smiley would be he. She was gratified in retrospect that she had demonstrated this by holy matrimony. The effect of Lady Ann departure upon her former husband did not interest society – which indeed is unconcerned with the aftermath of sensation. Yet it would be interesting to know what Sawley and his flock might have made of Smiley reaction; of that fleshy, bespectacled face puckered in energetic concentration as he read so deeply among the lesser German poets, the chubby wet hands clenched beneath the tumbling sleeves. But Sawley profited by the occasion with the merest of shrugs by remarking partir c'est courir un peu, and he appeared to be unaware that though Lady Ann just ran away, a little of George Smiley had indeed died. That part of Smiley which survived was as incongruous to his appearance as love, or a taste for unrecognized poets: it was his profession, which was that of intelligence officer. It was a profession he enjoyed, and which mercifully provided him with colleagues equally obscure in character and origin. It also provided him with what he had once loved best in life: academic excursions into the mystery of human behaviour, disciplined by the practical application of his own deductions. Some time in the twenties when Smiley had emerged from his unimpressive school and lumbered blinking into the murky cloisters of his unimpressive Oxford College, he had dreamt of Fellowships and a life devoted to the literary obscurities of seventeenth-century Germany. But his own tutor, who knew Smiley better, guided him wisely away from the honours that would undoubtedly have been his. On a sweet July morning in a puzzled and rather pink Smiley had sat before an interviewing board of the Overseas Committee for Academic Research, an organization of which he had un­accountably never heard. Jebedee (his tutor) had been oddly vague about the introduction: 'Give these people a try, Smiley, they might have you and they pay badly enough to guarantee you decent company.' But Smiley was annoyed and said so. It worried him that Jebedee, usually so precise, was so evasive. In a slight huff he agreed to postpone his reply to All Souls until he had seen Jebedee 'mysterious people'. He wasn't introduced to the Board, but he knew half of its members by sight. There was Fielding, the French medievalist from Cambridge, Sparke from the School of Oriental Languages, and Steed-Asprey who had been dining at High Table the night Smiley had been Jebedee guest. He had to admit he was impressed. For Fielding to leave his rooms, let alone Cambridge, was in itself a miracle. Afterwards Smiley always thought of that interview as a fan dance; a calculated progression of disclosures, each revealing different parts of a mysterious entity. Finally Steed-Asprey, who seemed to be Chairman, removed the last veil, and the truth stood before him in all its dazzling nakedness. He was being offered a post in what, for want of a better name, Steed-Asprey blushingly described as the Secret Service. Smiley had asked for time to think. They gave him a week. No one mentioned pay. That night he stayed in London at somewhere rather good and took himself to the theatre. He felt strangely light-headed and this worried him. He knew very well that he would accept, that he could have done so at the interview. It was only an instinctive caution, and perhaps a pardonable desire to play the coquette with Fielding, which prevented him from doing so. Following his affirmation came training: anonymous country houses, anonymous instructors, a good deal of travel and, looming ever larger, the fantastic prospect of working completely alone. His first operational posting was relatively pleasant: a two-year appointment as englischer Dozent at a provincial German university: lectures on Keats and vacations in Bavarian hunting lodges with groups of earnest and solemnly promiscuous German students. Towards the end of each long vacation he brought some of them back to England, having already earmarked the likely ones and conveyed his recommendations by clandestine means to an address in Bonn; during the entire two years he had no idea of whether his recommend­ations had been accepted or ignored. He had no means of knowing even whether his candidates were approached. Indeed he had no means of knowing whether his messages ever reached their destination; and he had no contact with the Department while in England. His emotions in performing this work were mixed, and irreconcilable. It intrigued him to evaluate from a detached position what he had learnt to describe as 'the agent potential' of a human being; to devise minuscule tests of character and behaviour which could inform him of the qualities of a ­candidate. This part of him was bloodless and inhuman – Smiley in this role was the international mercenary of his trade, amoral and without motive beyond that of personal gratification. Conversely it saddened him to witness in himself the gradual death of natural pleasure. Always withdrawn, he now found himself shrinking from the temptations of friendship and human loyalty; he guarded himself warily from spontaneous reaction. By the strength of his intellect, he forced himself to observe humanity with clinical objectivity, and because he was neither immortal nor infallible he hated and feared the falseness of his life. But Smiley was a sentimental man and the long exile strengthened his deep love of England. He fed hungrily on memories of Oxford; its beauty, its rational ease, and the mature slowness of its judgements. He dreamt of windswept autumn holidays at Hartland Quay, of long trudges over the Cornish cliffs, his face smooth and hot against the sea wind. This was his other secret life, and he grew to hate the bawdy intrusion of the new Germany, the stamping and shouting of uniformed students, the scarred, arrogant faces and their cheapjack answers. He resented, too, the way in which the Faculty had tampered with his subject – his beloved German literature. And there had been a night, a terrible night in the winter of when Smiley had stood at his window and watched a great bonfire in the university court: round it stood hundreds of students, their faces ­exultant and glistening in the dancing light. And into the pagan fire they threw books in their hundreds. He knew whose books they were: Thomas Mann, Heine, Lessing and a host of others. And Smiley, his damp hand cupped round the end of his cigarette, watching and hating, triumphed that he knew his enemy. Nineteen thirty-nine saw him in Sweden, the accredited agent of a well-known Swiss small-arms manufacturer, his association with the firm conveniently backdated. Conveniently, too, his appearance had somehow altered, for Smiley had discovered in himself a talent for the part which went beyond the rudimentary change to his hair and the addition of a small moustache. For four years he had played the part, travelling back and forth between Switzerland, Germany and Sweden. He had never guessed it was possible to be frightened for so long. He developed a nervous irritation in his left eye which remained with him fifteen years later; the strain etched lines on his fleshy cheeks and brow. He learnt what it was never to sleep, never to relax, to feel at any time of day or night the restless beating of his own heart, to know the extremes of solitude and self-pity, the sudden unreasoning desire for a woman, for drink, for ­exercise, for any drug to take away the tension of his life. Against this background he conducted his authentic commerce and his work as a spy. With the progress of time the network grew, and other countries repaired their lack of foresight and preparation. In he was recalled. Within six weeks he was yearning to return, but they never let him go. 'You're finished,' Steed-Asprey said: 'train new men, take time off. Get married or something. Unwind.' Smiley proposed to Steed-Asprey secretary, the Lady Ann Sercomb. The war was over. They paid him off, and he took his beautiful wife to Oxford to devote himself to the obscur­ities of seventeenth-century Germany. But two years later Lady Ann was in Cuba, and the revelations of a young Russian cypher-clerk in Ottawa had created a new demand for men of Smiley experience. The job was new, the threat elusive and at first he enjoyed it. But younger men were coming in, perhaps with fresher minds. Smiley was no material for promotion and it dawned on him gradually that he had entered middle age without ever being young, and that he was – in the nicest possible way – on the shelf. Things changed. Steed-Asprey was gone, fled from the new world to India, in search of another civilization. Jebedee was dead. He had boarded a train at Lille in with his radio operator, a young Belgian, and neither had been heard of again. Fielding was wedded to a new thesis on Roland – only Maston remained, Maston the career man, the war-time recruit, the Ministers' Adviser on Intelligence; 'the first man,' Jebedee had said, 'to play power tennis at Wimbledon.' The NATO alliance, and the desperate measures contemplated by the Americans, altered the whole nature of Smiley Service. Gone for ever were the days of Steed-Asprey, when as like as not you took your orders over a glass of port in his rooms at Magdalen; the inspired amateurism of a handful of highly qualified, under-paid men had given way to the efficiency, bureaucracy and intrigue of a large Government department – effectively at the mercy of Maston, with his expensive clothes and his knighthood, his distinguished grey hair and silver-coloured ties; Maston, who even remembered his secretary birthday, whose manners were a by-word among the ladies of the registry; Maston, apologetically extending his empire and regretfully moving to even larger offices; Maston, holding smart house-parties at Henley and feeding on the success of his subordinates. They had brought him in during the war, the professional civil servant from an orthodox department, a man to handle paper and integrate the brilliance of his staff with the cumbersome machine of bureaucracy. It comforted the Great to deal with a man they knew, a man who could reduce any colour to grey, who knew his masters and could walk among them. And he did it so well. They liked his diffidence when he apologized for the company he kept, his insincerity when he defended the vagaries of his subordinates, his flexibility when formulating new commitments. Nor did he let go the advantages of a cloak and dagger man malgré lui, wearing the cloak for his masters and preserving the dagger for his servants. Ostensibly, his position was an odd one. He was not the nominal Head of Service, but the Ministers' Adviser on Intelligence, and Steed-Asprey had described him for all time as the Head Eunuch. This was a new world for Smiley: the brilliantly lit ­corridors, the smart young men. He felt pedestrian and old-fashioned, homesick for the dilapidated terrace house in Knightsbridge where it had all begun. His appearance seemed to reflect this discomfort in a kind of physical recession which made him more hunched and frog-like than ever. He blinked more, and acquired the nickname of 'Mole'. But his débutante secretary adored him, and referred to him invariably as 'My darling teddy-bear'. Smiley was now too old to go abroad. Maston had made that clear: 'Anyway, my dear fellow, as like as not you're blown after all the ferreting about in the war. Better stick at home, old man, and keep the home fires burning.' Which goes some way to explaining why George Smiley sat in the back of a London taxi at two o'clock on the morning of Wednesday, January, on his way to Cambridge Circus.",2269
36,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview33,"It been nearly years since my second marriage ended, and since I finished writing Heartburn, which is often referred to as a thinly disguised novel. I have no real quarrel with this description, even though I've noticed, over the years, that the words ""thinly disguised"" are applied mostly to books written by women. Let face it, Philip Roth and John Updike picked away at the carcasses of their early marriages in book after book, but to the best of my knowledge they were never hit with the ""thinly disguised"" thing. But as I was saying, I have no real quarrel with this description. My second marriage in fact ended exactly the way the one in Heartburn does, shortly after I discovered that my husband was having an affair with an unbelievably tall person. In the book, I thinly disguised myself by making myself considerably more composed than I was at the time, and I thinly disguised my ex-husband by giving him a beard that belonged to one of my friends. The unbelievably tall person he had the affair with remained unbelievably tall; it my experience as a novelist that some things lose everything if they are disguised, even thinly, and that therefore it best to just leave them alone. On the other hand, most of the characters in Heartburn are entirely fictional, and many of the things that happen in the book didn't happen at all. I made them up. Or I stole them from other people. My therapy group, for instance, was never robbed at gunpoint, but I had a friend whose group was, and the minute she told me the story I stashed it in my ""Use This Someday"" file and hoped I would be the first person to take advantage of what seemed to me just the sort of comic, slightly public episode that was destined to be used by someone, sooner rather than later. The world I live in is filled with ravenous writers looking for material, and you have to move quickly if you want to write about even your own life, much less someone else. What more, I am not and have never been a food writer. My mother never ran off and joined a commune run by a man named Mel who thought he was God. There were no pet hamsters named Arnold and Shirley in my first marriage, and my first husband did not talk to me in a high squeaky voice that was meant to be Arnold, and I did not reply in a high squeaky voice that was meant to be Shirley. But I do love food and occasionally write about it; it was my sister who ran off and joined a commune run by a man named Mel who thought he was God; and during my first marriage there was quite a lot of talking in high squeaky voices, on account of the cats. Furthermore, I left out a lot of what happened, but I never get credit for this, especially from my second husband, who ought to be grateful I did. Everyone always asks, ""Was he [first husband] mad at you for writing the book?"" and I have to say, ""Yes, yes, he was"". He still is. It is one of the most fascinating things to me about the whole episode: he cheated on me, and then got to behave as if he was the one who had been wronged because I wrote about it! I mean, it not as if I wasn't a writer. It not as if I hadn't often written about myself. I'd even written about him. What did he think was going to happen? That I would take a vow of silence for the first time in my life? Here another fascinating thing about the episode: the unbelievably tall woman who had an affair with my then-husband had a husband of her own - an extremely pompous British civil servant I thinly disguised as an extremely pompous American civil servant - and to this day he constantly takes shots at me for the damage I did to his family. I mean, really! He and his wife eventually divorced, and let me tell you, it was not my fault! And this book had nothing to do with it either! This is the first time I have written about this episode when I wasn't thinly disguising things, and look at all these exclamation points that have just leapt into the text. My mother taught me many things when I was growing up, but the main thing I learned from her is that everything is copy. She said it again and again, and I have quoted her saying it again and again. As a result, I knew the moment my marriage ended that someday it might make a book - if I could just stop crying. One of the things I'm proudest of is that I managed to convert an event that seemed to me hideously tragic at the time to a comedy - and if that not fiction, I don't know what is.",847
37,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jul/30/journeys-in-literature-the-odyssey-by-homer-the-first-step,"This is the first one, the big one, the ur-road movie: the Odyssey. Homer poem tells of Odysseus decade-long attempt to return to his home island of Ithaca – a “man of twists and turns driven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy”. ( Robert Fagles’ translation for Penguin , which I recommend.) Here some context. Banish the thoughts of modern nation-state Greece and think instead of the Hellenes as they were, a widely scattered, littoral people, linked by language and custom, spread thinly from Massilia (now Marseille, founded by the Greeks in about to the Black Sea. Edith Hall book Introducing the Ancient Greeks reminds me that Plato said his people liked to live “like frogs or ants around the pond”. They were traders and colonists and explorers. One Marseillais, Pytheas , circumnavigated Britain and perhaps got as far as Denmark and Iceland, and wrote about it in his lost book On the Ocean. The trackless wastes of the sea were the Greeks’ element. Aside from the Odyssey, in antiquity there existed an epic account, called Returns, of other Greek heroes’ homecomings from Troy, thought to have included the stories of Agamemnon catastrophic return to Argos, only to be slaughtered by his wife Clytemnestra, and Menelaos journey back to Sparta, via a long detour to Egypt. A fragment of Sappho, discovered on papyrus last year , has the narrator-poet anxiously awaiting her brother Charaxos return from a voyage. The perilous maritime journey was not only a Greek poetic theme, but part of Greek lived experience. Like the myriad literary successors that have grown like branches and leaves from the great trunk of this epic poem, the Odyssey is a story about the journey through life and time, as well as through space. Homecoming is more than a physical arrival. For Odysseus, half the adventure continues after he has seen off Scylla and Charybdis, the Cyclops and Circe, the Lotus Eaters and the Cattle of the Sun. Having found himself washed up – after years of trying to get there – on the shores of his beloved Ithaca, he manages to avoid the pompous mistake that got Agamemnon killed. Instead of arriving all puffed up and victorious, he disguises himself as a beggar. Undercover, he scopes out his palace, his domain, works out what he has to do to regain his kingdom and sets about it carefully, cleverly and ruthlessly. The Odyssey is an object lesson in the power of human cunning. He is, we are told in the earliest lines of the poem, the only one of his comrades who gets home alive: “The recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all.” Meantime his son, Telemachus, embarks on a journey, too: the goddess Athene sends him away from Ithaca on a voyage to visit the heroes Nestor and Menelaos, to discover news of Odysseus – Telemachus own Bildungsroman . It is on this journey that he learns to be the true son of his father. As well as all of this, the Odyssey is a poem of extraordinary pleasures: it is a salt-caked, storm-tossed, wine-dark treasury of tales of terrifying monsters and sexy witches, of alluring sirens and inscrutable queens, a poem that takes you down to the coldly echoing chambers of the dead and back up to the coves and cliffs and winding paths of Ithaca. A poem of many twists and turns, like life itself.",575
38,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/05/hachette-woody-allen-memoir-protest-ronan-farrow,"Dozens of Hachette employees staged a walkout of its New York City offices on Thursday in protest against the company decision to publish Woody Allen autobiography . Grand Central, a Hachette imprint, announced this week it would publish the Hollywood director Apropos of Nothing on April. Financial terms were not disclosed for the book, which Grand Central quietly acquired a year ago. The Allen is an Oscar-winning film-maker, known for such works as Annie Hall and The Purple Rose of Cairo, and he is among the most influential comedians of his time. But allegations by his daughter Dylan Farrow that he molested her as a child in the early have effectively stalled his movie career in the US. Allen has denied any wrongdoing, and he was never charged after two separate investigations in the The author Ronan Farrow, Allen son, has stood by his sister account. Farrow book on the #MeToo era, Catch and Kill, was recently published by Little, Brown, also an imprint of the French-owned media group, and he has threatened to cut ties with the publisher . Hachette employees told the Guardian they felt moved to take action because they felt their concerns about the Allen memoir were not being addressed. “It a huge conflict of interest and wrong,” said one Hachette employee, who declined to be identified. Asked if they had called for the book to be withdrawn, the employee added: “It not up to us – it up to the higher-ups if they want to hear our voices.” Another employee said: “Everybody has a right to respond to allegations against them but do we have to pay them God knows how much to do that? Everybody should take responsibility for their actions.” In an earlier statement, employees of Hachette, or HBG, a subsidiary of Lagardère Group , said: “We stand in solidarity with Ronan Farrow , Dylan Farrow and survivors of sexual assault.” After staff walked out, Dylan Farrow tweeted: “Unbelievably overwhelmed and so incredibly grateful for the solidarity demonstrated by @HachetteUS and @littlebrown employees today. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.” She added that Hachette decision to publish Allen book was “deeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother”. Anger over the planned publication of Allen book escalated after Hachette CEO, Michael Pietsch, claimed in an interview with the New York Times that “each book has its own mission. Our job as a publisher is to help the author achieve what they have set out to do in the creation of their book.” In an email to Pietsch, Ronan Farrow claimed that Hachette policy of editorial independence between imprints “does not relieve you of your moral and professional obligations as the publisher of Catch and Kill, and as the leader of a company being asked to assist in efforts by abusive men to whitewash their crimes”. Farrow continued: “As you and I worked on Catch and Kill”, which addressed “the damage Woody Allen did to my family … you were secretly planning to publish a book by the person who committed those acts of sexual abuse. “Obviously I can’t in good conscience work with you any more,” he added. “Imagine this were your sister.” That criticism followed a statement, released via Twitter on Tuesday, in which Farrow accused Hachette of “a lack of ethics and compassion for the victims of sexual abuse”. His mother, Mia Farrow, said in statement that that Hachette decision to publish her former partner memoir “provides yet another example of the profound privilege that power, money and notoriety affords. “Hachette utter complicity in this should be called out for what it is and they should have to answer for it.” The protest won support from others in the publishing industry. Unionized employees at HarperCollins sent out a tweet soon after Hachette staff walked out: “We stand in solidarity with Hachette workers. Collective action is how we hold the powerful accountable.” Allen has in recent years been largely shunned by the film industry in the aftermath of accusations against recently convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein fuelled the #MeToo movement. Several actors, among them Greta Gerwig, Timothée Chalamet, Mira Sorvino and Rebecca Hall, have since expressed regret for working with Allen. Some have apologized to Dylan Farrow. Two years ago, Amazon Studios cancelled a distribution deal and it was reported that that Allen memoir was passed over by several publishers. The Associated Press contributed to this report",740
39,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/11/hugo-awards-2017-nk-jemisin-repeats-best-novel-win-the-obelisk,"A year after NK Jemisin became the first black person to win the Hugo award for best novel , the African American author has landed the prestigious science fiction prize for the second year running. Jemisin was announced as the winner of the best novel Hugo at Worldcon in Helsinki on Friday. She took the prize, which is voted for by fans, for The Obelisk Gate , the follow-up to her Hugo award-winning novel The Fifth Season. The series is set in a world that is constantly threatened by seismic activity, and where the mutants who can control the environment are oppressed by humans. The New York Times called Jemisin writing in the series “intricate and extraordinary”. Hugos administrator Nicholas Whyte said that people voted in this year award, the third-highest vote total ever and the highest participation in the Hugos for a Worldcon outside the US or UK. “There been a very high level of genuine engagement and thoughtful participation,” said Whyte. “People can read into that what they like.” The last two years of the Hugos have been plagued by block-voting campaigns from conservative lobbies calling themselves the Sad Puppies, and the more politically extreme Rabid Puppies. The two factions were out to combat a perceived tendency to reward books described by one disgruntled writer as “niche, academic, overtly to the left in ideology and flavour and ultimately lacking what might best be called visceral, gut-level, swashbuckling fun”. In this led to “no award” beating the Puppies’ slate of nominees in an unprecedented five categories , in order to avoid giving prizes to the group nominations. In candidates put forward by the so-called Puppies also dominated the ballots , but only two “no awards” were given . This year, there was not a single “no award” given. On a roster of predominantly female winners, Seanan McGuire Every Heart a Doorway took the best novella gong, Ursula Vernon The Tomato Thief won best novelette, and Amal El-Mohtar Seasons of Glass and Iron won best short story. Revered fantasy author Ursula K Le Guin took the best related work Hugo for Words Are My Matte r, a collection of her writing about life and books spanning the last years, while Lois McMaster Bujold won a new award for best series, for her long-running Vorkosigan Saga . The John W Campbell award for best new writer was taken by Ada Palmer . “This is the first time that the same author has won two years running since Lois McMaster Bujold in and a quarter of a century ago; and of course Bujold continuing appeal was confirmed by the Vorkosigan saga winning the new best series category,” said Whyte of Jemisin win. “This is a super set of results ... which demonstrate that SF is thriving and diverse.” When Jemisin won the Hugo last year, she said that when she set out to write The Fifth Season, she had thought that no one would want to read it, and then when it was nominated for a Hugo, she had wondered who might vote for it. She wrote on her website : “I wondered how many of my fellow SFF fans, in a year headlined by reactionary pushback against the presence and performance of people like me in the genre, would choose to vote for the story of a fortysomething big-boned dreadlocked woman of colour waging an epic struggle against the forces of oppression.” “But I forgot: only a small number of ideologues have attempted to game the Hugo awards . That small number can easily be overwhelmed, their regressive clamour stilled, if the rest of SFF fandom simply stands up to be counted. Stands up to say that yes, they do want literary innovation, and realistic representation. Stands up to say that yes, they do just want to read good stories – but what makes a story good is skill, and audacity and the ability to consider the future clearly rather than through the foggy lenses of nostalgia and privilege.” The Hugos have been running since the and have been won by authors including Isaac Asimov, Robert A Heinlein and Neil Gaiman.

40,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/02/nk-jemisin-its-easier-to-get-a-book-set-in-black-africa-published-if-youre-white,"In NK Jemisin became the first writer ever to win three consecutive Hugo best novel awards for science fiction and fantasy. Her first award had been in for her novel The Fifth Season , and its two sequels, The Obelisk Gate and The Stone Sky , won in the following years. Yet speaking on the phone from her home in coronavirus-hit Brooklyn, Jemisin says she never thought she’d be published. “I honestly didn’t think I had a chance. You just didn’t see characters like me in fiction,” she says. Growing up in Mobile, Alabama and New York, Jemisin was an avid reader, making up her own stories from the age of eight, but the lack of black women writing science fiction and fantasy, the genre she loved, made her believe it wasn’t for her. “We were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction, occasionally young white women fiction, and if that how you’ve grown up, then that is what is normal.” We were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction and if that how you’ve grown up, then that is what is normal Occasionally black characters would make their way into those stories written by white men. Jemisin recalls Arthur C Clarke Childhood End , in which Jan Rodricks, a black man, is the last human on Earth. “There a paragraph when the black male character is introduced where Clarke pauses the story to basically explain to the audience that, you know, this character is black, but it doesn’t really matter anymore in the future. And so for all intents and purposes, he basically a white guy who just happens to have black skin. Not really the ideal way to handle it.” She discovered Octavia Butler in the and that “helped a great deal, but she was one person”. Jemisin trained as a psychologist and worked in universities, in a branch of counselling psychology specific to late adolescents. She carried on writing but gave up on any idea of publishing – she’d been to graduate school, she had student loans, it didn’t make sense to change careers. Then she hit and had a “mini midlife crisis”. She’d written a novel – an early take on what would become The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms – and sent it out to publishers, also taking science fiction and fantasy writing workshop Viable Paradise , where she gave short stories a try for the first time, and began selling her work. The novel didn’t get picked up, “probably because it wasn’t very good”. She wrote another, The Killing Moon , which got her an agent. Set in a world based on ancient Egypt, it had an almost exclusively black cast – and didn’t find her a publisher. “It was the mid and at that time science fiction and fantasy publishers were not super interested in stories with black casts by black writers. They had done some stories with black casts by white writers, but they were not interested in those stories coming from people who actually were black.” Rejection letters would say things like, “we like this, but we’re not sure how to market it. We like this but we’re not sure who its audience would be”– the implication from publishers being “that fantasy readers don’t want to read about black people. Black people don’t want to read fantasy. So what do we do?” Jemisin decided to rewrite The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms , making nearly the entire cast white. “All of them were horrible people. They’d shank each other for, like, nothing. And I wrote this angry story about this lone brown girl going into this place full of mean white people,” she says. It went to auction, with three different publishers fighting over it. “And I’m like, this is what you want?” she says. “I was pretty bitter … I’d taken such care in [ The Killing Moon ] to include sympathetic white people, but that wasn’t what they wanted.” Telling of Yeine Darr, an outcast from the barbarian north who is summoned to the city of Sky, where she is named one of the potential heirs to the king (whose family has enslaved the gods), The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms won Jemisin the Locus award for best first novel in Two more novels in the Inheritance trilogy followed in an astonishingly prolific months. The books were selling steadily, if not meteorically, and her publishers were hungry for more: luckily, she had held on to The Killing Moon . Set in the ancient city-state of Gujaareh, where the Gatherers’ role is to harvest the magic of sleeping minds to use it for good, until the dreamers start dying, it was nominated for a Nebula award. A Nasa-sponsored workshop for writers about astronomy and her fascination with volcanoes fed into The Fifth Season By now Jemisin was back in her day job as a counsellor. She had a dream, of “an angry woman coming towards me with a mountain floating behind her”. It gelled with ideas she’d had since going on a Nasa-sponsored workshop for writers about astronomy, and she began to write The Fifth Season . Taking place on a planet with “one vast, unbroken continent”, the earthquake-racked Stillness, the novel opens with the “end of the world” as one man – a despised and enslaved “orogene”, who can manipulate the earth – tears a great rift through the heart of the world. Jemisin has said in the past that “it pretty obvious that I’m drawing on the human history of structural oppression, as well as my feelings about this moment in American history”. It won Jemisin astonishing plaudits, as well as a deal for a television series. Accepting her third Hugo, she told her audience in a winner speech that went viral : “This has been a hard year, hasn’t it? A hard few years. A hard century. For some of us, things have always been hard.” Writing the trilogy while working almost full time hadn’t been easy, particularly as Jemisin mother had fallen ill in In the middle of writing the third book, she decided to launch a Patreon , an online subscriber platform, to fund her work. She didn’t have high hopes, but “I got a lot more money than I was expecting, so I went ahead and quit the day job” . That was After a number of years in which a group of writers – mostly male, white, and overwhelmingly rightwing – attempted to thwart the increasing diversity of the Hugos by block voting for their approved titles, Jemisin triple whammy felt like a turning of the tide. As she put it in her blistering winner speech: “This is the year in which I get to smile at all of those naysayers – every single mediocre insecure wannabe who fixes their mouth to suggest that I do not belong on this stage, that people like me cannot possibly have earned such an honour, that when they win it it meritocracy but when we win it it ‘identity politics’ –… I get to smile at those people, and lift a massive, shining, rocket-shaped middle finger in their direction.” She gone on to raise that middle finger at them in her writing. The enemy in her new novel, The City We Became , is a huge, tentacled, Lovecraftian horror, an evil out to destroy cities. But this villain is no homage to the master of eldritch horror. In Jemisin story – “a glorious fantasy,” says Neil Gaiman – the greatest of cities become living entities. New York has just awoken, and a “beast from the deeps” is out to take it down. “When you experience walking through any city at the right time, when the light is right, and it feels like it you and the city communing. I wanted to put some words to that feeling, as artists do, and that what I came up with,” says Jemisin. When you read HP Lovecraft books like The Horror at Red Hook he blatant about the racism HP Lovecraft, she says, also wanted to put words to a feeling: the feeling he had, however, was a vicious xenophobia. “When you read things like The Horror at Red Hook he blatant both about the racism and the fact that the racism is the inspiration for his feeling that these people are evil.” Until a bust of Lovecraft was given to winners of the World Fantasy awards. This changed when Nnedi Okorafor won the best novel prize in – the first black person to win it since its inception in “She received the award and was like, do you understand exactly what Lovecraft represents to someone like me?” says Jemisin. “There a sort of running thread in science fiction to ‘engage with the art and not the artist’, probably because so many science fiction writers are problematic people. But in Lovecraft case doing that is not just egregious but dishonest, because Lovecraft fiction is so rooted in his xenophobia.” The evil in The City We Became is, Jemisin has said, “basically Cthulhu” (Lovecraft octopoid monster), with a group of diverse characters facing off against it – and against, pointedly, the man-bunned alt-right trolls it recruits to fight for it. “I was choosing to engage with Lovecraft fear of the city – his sense that these diverse people brought a bad energy to it,” she says. “My take was: of course they bring an energy to the city, all people do. He perceived it as evil, but really it just life.” Does she feel that Lovecraft, and the tentacles of racism that have wound through science fiction and fantasy for decades, are vanquished these days? It around years, after all, since The Killing Moon was rejected across the board. Perhaps a little, she says. Editors and publishers are now aware of the demand for inclusive, representative fiction, but – as a recent survey highlighted – US publishing is still blindingly white in terms of staffing. “And so there a strange and nasty tendency that developed for publishers to be perfectly OK with novels about certain groups of people written by white folks, but not written by members of that group,” she says. “It still easier for a white person to write a book with an all-black cast set in fantasy Africa and get it published than for a black person.” Still, with her clutch of Hugos, Jemisin is having the last laugh. Looking back on that record-breaking night in she says, “There are detractors in the science fiction community who feel that was an inappropriate speech to make. They are welcome to that opinion,” she tells me, with extreme dryness. “I felt like I needed a little catharsis.” The City We Became by NK Jemisin is published by Orbit To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com .

41,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick,"n August a party of writers and publishers climbed Monument Mountain in Massachusetts, during the American equivalent of a hike in the Lakes. Among the literati on this excursion were Nathaniel Hawthorne, author of The Scarlet Letter ( No in this series ), a recently published bestseller (although a term not yet in use), and the young novelist Herman Melville, who, after a very successful debut ( Typee ), was struggling to complete an unwieldy coming-of-age tale about a South&nbsp;Seas&nbsp;whaler. Melville, who was just had never met Hawthorne. But after a day in the open air, a quantity of champagne, and a sudden downpour, the younger man was enraptured with his new friend, who had ""dropped germinous seeds into my soul"". Rarely in Anglo-American literature has there been such a momentous meeting. It was the attraction of opposites. Hawthorne, from an old New England family, was careful, cultivated and inward, a ""dark angel"", according to one. Melville was a ragged, voluble, romantic New Yorker from mercantile stock. Both writers had hovered on the edge of insolvency and each was a kind of outsider. A fervent correspondence ensued. Melville, indeed, became so infatuated that he moved with his wife and family to become Hawthorne neighbour. Thus liberated, fulfilled, and inspired to say ""NO! in thunder, to Christianity"", he completed Moby-Dick ; or, The Whale, in the spring of After an early reading of the manuscript, Hawthorne acclaimed it in a letter that remains, tantalisingly, lost. All we have is Melville ecstatic response (""Your heart beat in my ribs and mine in yours, and both in God...""), and, subsequently, a dedicatory declaration of Melville admiration for Hawthorne ""genius"" at the front of Moby-Dick (the first edition hyphenated the whale name). So how homoerotic was this friendship? No one will ever know; it remains one of the mysteries of American letters. All we can say for certain is that, after climbing Monument Mountain, Melville adopted Hawthorne idea of the ""romance"" as a mixed-genre, symbolic kind of fiction, and found his creative genius somehow released in the making of his new book. And that is everything, because Moby-Dick is, for me, the supreme American novel, the source and the inspiration of everything that follows in the American literary canon. I first read it, inspired by my sixth-form English teacher, Lionel Bruce, aged about and it stayed with me ever since. Moby-Dick is a book you come back to, again and again, to find new treasures and delights, a storehouse of language, incident and strange wisdom. Moby-Dick is – among some fierce contenders which will appear later in this series – the great American novel whose genius was only recognised long after its author was dead. From its celebrated opening line (""Call me Ishmael"") it plunges the reader into the narrator quest for meaning ""in the damp, drizzly November of my soul"". Ishmael is an existential outsider. What follows is profoundly modern yet essentially Victorian, spanning chapters. It is a literary performance that is exhilarating, extraordinary, sometimes exasperating and, towards its apocalyptic climax, unputdownable. When Ishmael ships aboard the Pequod, his own quotidian search becomes inexorably joined to the darker quest, in which the captain of the doomed whaler, ""monomaniacal Ahab"", sets out to revenge himself on the great white whale that has bitten off his leg. This ""grand, ungodly, godlike man"", one of fiction greatest characters – ""crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale"" – is not only pursuing his nemesis, a ""hooded phantom"", across the ocean wastes, he is also fighting the God that lurks behind the ""unreasoning mask"" of the symbolic whale. Eventually, a whaling expedition from Nantucket – something experienced by the young Melville himself – becomes the story of an obsession, an investigation into the meaning of life. Next to Ahab and Ishmael, this massive novel is also rich in minor characters, from the tattooed harpooner Queequeg, the ship mate Starbuck, Daggoo and Fedallah the Parsee – all told, a typically American crew. And so a ""romance"" (Hawthorne term) inspired by the true story of the Essex , a whaler that sank when it was attacked by a sperm whale in the Pacific in November becomes like a terrifying (at times, intolerable) sea voyage, culminating in a thrilling three-day chase in which Moby-Dick destroys the Pequod. Ishmael survives to tell his tale by clinging to Queequeg carved coffin. Moby-Dick is usually described, as I've just done, as an elemental novel in which the outsider Ishmael is pitted against the fathomless infinity of the sea, grappling with the big questions of existence. That not inaccurate, but there also another Moby-Dick , full of rough humour, sharp comic moments, and witty asides. ""Better sleep with a sober cannibal"", says Ishmael, when forced to share a bed with the tattooed harpooner Queequeg, ""than a drunken Christian."" For those readers intimidated by the novel bleak majesty, I think the humour offers a good way in. A note on the text The pre-publication history of Moby-Dick has been the subject of endless scholarship, and provides a case study in Anglo-American co-publishing in the century. Melville, who was short of money, actually made his first contract for a new novel, then known as The Whale , with the British publisher Richard Bentley. But he kept the printing in New York so he could oversee the proofs, and wrote to Hawthorne, from New York, that he must ""work and slave on my 'Whale' while it is driving through the press"". In fact, he was simultaneously working on revisions to his manuscript and proofreading what had been set. Meanwhile, Melville had still not yet settled a contract with an American publisher. As a result, the British edition would differ from the American in hundreds of small ways. The most important was the change of title. Rather late in the day, he wrote to Bentley: "" Moby-Dick is a legitimate title for the book, being the name given to a particular whale who, if I may so express myself, is the hero of the volume."" Bentley seems to have been slow to respond. On October, the English edition, The Whale , was published, in an edition of only copies. Then, on November, the American edition, Moby-Dick , (with its hyphenated title), finally appeared from Harpers. Almost as significantly, the US edition contained an ""Epilogue"", which explains Ishmael miraculous survival and, thus, how the story of the great white whale came to be told. For some unknown reason, the epilogue is absent from the British edition. British reviewers were puzzled to read a book with a first-person narrator who apparently did not survive to tell the tale. Accordingly, the Spectator objected that ""nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known: thus, he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit if they all perish."" Two other papers asked ""How does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story?"" The upshot was confusion, and poor English reviews. These, in turn, cast a shadow over the American reception of the novel. Melville career never really recovered. He told Hawthorne in ""I have pretty much made up my mind to be annihilated."" When he died, in Melville was virtually forgotten, with Billy Budd still in manuscript, unpublished. Today, Moby-Dick is, in the words of the Oxford Companion to English Literature , ""the closest approach the United States has had to a national prose epic"".

42,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/12/lionel-shriver-dropped-from-prize-judges-over-diversity-comments,"Lionel Shriver has been dropped from the judging panel for a writing competition run by magazine Mslexia, after the author slammed publisher Penguin Random House for its diversity and inclusion policies. Debbie Taylor, editorial director and founder of Mslexia, said that Shriver comments in a piece for the Spectator magazine were “not consistent with Mslexia ethos and mission” and would “alienate the very women we are trying to support”. Consequently, Shriver would no longer be a judge on their annual short story competition, she said. “Since our launch in Msxlexia raison d’etre has been to provide a safe space for all women writers – whatever their circumstances – to develop their craft. We actively encourage submissions from marginalised writers and frequently draw attention to the issues they face,” Taylor said. Shriver, a UK-based American writer who won the Orange prize for We Need to Talk About Kevin, made headlines after dismissing Penguin Random House goal to have a more diverse staff and author list by as a sign that the publisher was “drunk on virtue”. Lionel Shriver is wrong. Penguin push for diversity will translate into better books “From now until literary excellence will be secondary to ticking all those ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual preference and crap-education boxes,” she wrote. “We can safely infer from that email that if an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay transgender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter, it will be published, whether or not said manuscript is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed-paper recycling.” Shriver comments were widely condemned over the weekend – one author called the piece “deeply embarrassing” – but gained support from journalist Toby Young. On Monday, Penguin Random House stood by its policy , saying: “We firmly believe that giving a platform to more diverse voices will lead to a greater richness of creativity and stories, rather than stifling them.” Taylor said that a new judge for the short-story competition, one of five writing contests Mslexia is running this year, would be announced shortly. In its year, the Mslexia short story prize sees the winning author receive a trip to a writing retreat and a day with an editor from publisher Virago. The winning story is published in the magazine. Shriver told the Guardian she stood by the position she had adopted in her column. “I am not anti-diversity, and I have no problem with the programme that PRH runs to encourage the development of a broader range of voices. But statistical targets perfectly mirroring the UK population in race, gender, class, ethnicity, and disability are quite another matter. She added: “The US has had much more experience with affirmative action (positive discrimination) than the UK, and the policy has had unfortunate consequences. Even the US has moved consistently away from numerical diversity targets.”",479
43,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/15/we-need-to-talk-about-cultural-appropriation-why-lionel-shrivers-speech-touched-a-nerve,"Lionel Shriver knew she was going to annoy people. “Inviting a renowned iconoclast to speak about ‘community and belonging’ is like expecting a great white shark to balance a beach ball on its nose,” she said. She then used her keynote speech at the Brisbane writers’ festival to tear into the argument that writers – most particularly white writers – are guilty of “cultural appropriation” by writing from the point of view of characters from other cultural backgrounds. Referring to incidents in which two members of student government at an American university faced impeachment after attended a “tequila party” wearing sombreros, and reports of a ban on a Mexican restaurant from giving out sombreros, the author of We Need to Talk About Kevin said: “The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear: you’re not supposed to try on other people hats . Yet that what we’re paid to do, isn’t it? Step into other people shoes, and try on their hats.” The response was instant. Sudanese-born Australian social activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied, who was attending the event, walked out and then quickly penned a comment piece which argued that Shriver speech was “ a celebration of the unfettered exploitation of the experiences of others , under the guise of fiction”. Lionel Shriver full speech: 'I hope the concept of cultural appropriation is a passing fad' The argument is one of the most pointed yet in a debate that has a long history across literature, music, art and performance. While fiction might be the catalyst for this discussion, in the eyes of Abdel-Magied and others the issues are deeply rooted in real-world politics and a long history. The image of the blackface minstrel artist of America – the white performer painted up to look like a caricature of an African-American person and performing comic skits – is perhaps the most oft-invoked example of cultural appropriation from history. The racial dynamic of minstrelsy was complex – it was performed by African-American and Anglo actors alike – but while African-American performers often sought to gain financial security from the practice and in some cases use their platform to counter negative public stereotypes of themselves , white performers reinforced those stereotypes. This occurred within a society which still had not abolished slavery, and in which the political power dynamic was very much racialized. As the civil rights movement grew, so did criticism of white people attempting to exploit the images and experiences of people of colour for social and financial gain. This pattern is repeated around the world, particularly in places that experienced colonisation and slavery, such as India, Australia and South Africa. As scholars, artists, activists and writers of colour fought to gain access to predominantly white institutions and public spaces, and gained visibility in the cultural sphere, they began to criticise the inaccurate representations of themselves they saw created by and for the profit of others. The issue has been heavily explored within the academies but has gathered momentum in popular culture over the past decade. It underpins criticism of, among other things, Iggy Azalea “ sonic blackness ”, Coldplay “ myopic construction of India ” in their music videos, and Miley Cyrus dance moves . Director Cameron Crowe recently apologised for casting Anglo-American actor Emma Stone as a “part-Asian” character in the film Aloha – not the first time a white actor has been cast to play a character from a different racial background in mainstream cinema. The argument has been assisted particularly by the feminist community focus on “intersectionality” – crudely the idea that discrimination takes on different forms depending on the race, class and/or gender of the person discriminated against. The charge of “cultural appropriation” is not confined to fiction, but at the moment that perhaps the most hotly contested terrain . In March, Harry Potter author JK Rowling was accused of appropriating the “living tradition of a marginalised people” after a story published to her Pottermore website drew upon Navajo narratives about skinwalkers . Shriver herself mentioned the case of white British author Chris Cleave, whose novel The Other Hand is partly narrated by the character of a teenage Nigerian girl. “In principle, I admire his courage,” Shriver said. She then went on to detail reviewer Margot Kaminski concerns that Cleave was “exploiting” the character, that he ought to be “taking special care” with representing an experience that was not his own. Shriver took aim at the suggestion that an author should not “use” a character they created for the service of a plot they imagined. “Of course he using them for his plot!” she said. “How could he not? They are his characters, to be manipulated at his whim, to fulfil whatever purpose he cares to put them to. As Lionel Shriver made light of identity, I had no choice but to walk out on her | Yassmin Abdel-Magied “What boundaries around our own lives are we mandated to remain within?” asked Shriver. “I would argue that any story you can make yours is yours to tell, and trying to push the boundaries of the author personal experience is part of a fiction writer job.” While it seems obvious that writers of fiction will endeavour to write from perspectives that are not their own, many writers of colour argue there is a direct relationship between the difficulties they face trying to make headway in the literary industry and the success of white writers who depict people of colour in their fiction and who go on to build a successful literary career off that. The difference between cultural representation and cultural appropriation, by this logic, lies in the white writer telling stories (and therefore taking publishing opportunities) that would be better suited to a writer of colour. Some writers argue that it works in reverse, too. In an event for the Guardian in November last year , Booker Prize-winning author Marlon James said publishers too often “pander to the white woman” (the majority of the book-buying public), causing writers of colour to do the same. In a Facebook post responding to novelist Claire Vaye Watkins’ widely circulated essay On Pandering , James said that the kind of story favoured by publishers and awards committees – “bored suburban white woman in the middle of ennui experiences keenly observed epiphany” – pushed writers of colour into literary conformity for fear of losing out on a book deal. Speaking to Guardian Australia, Indigenous Australian author and Miles Franklin winner Kim Scott says it crucial to listen to the voices of marginalised people who may not be given enough space to tell their own stories. “Stories are offerings; they’re about opening up interior worlds in the interests of expanding the shared world and the shared sense of community. So if there many voices saying we need more of ‘us’ speaking ‘our’ stories, from wherever they’re saying that, then that needs to be listened to.” If there many voices saying we need more of ‘us’ speaking ‘our’ stories, then that needs to be listened to Kim Scott, author Omar Musa, the Malaysian-Australian poet, rapper and novelist, told Guardian Australia: “There is a history of stereotypes being perpetuated by white writers and very, very reductive narratives. People are just generally a lot more wary of that.” Musa says white writers should read, support and promote the work of writers of colour before attempting to encroach on that space themselves, if that is something they want to do. But he admits he finds the issue difficult; the suggestion that writers shouldn’t move outside the boundaries of their own experiences comes into direct conflict with what he sees as the purpose of fiction: to empathise with and understand other people lives. If you’re going to write from someone else perspective, Musa says, it important to avoid stereotypes, especially “if you want to make the characters rich and flawed as a good character should be”. Musa has his own experience of writing across the cultural divide. His first novel, Here Come The Dogs, was told from the perspective of a character with a Samoan background. Musa says accepting criticism is a crucial part of this process: “There will be people who will tell you that maybe you didn’t quite get this right, and you just have to cop that flack.” Maxine Beneba Clarke is an Australian-based writer of African-Caribbean descent. Her memoir The Hate Race was prompted by a torrent of racial abuse; her collection of short stories, Foreign Soil, was published to great acclaim after she won the Victorian Premier Literary award for an unpublished manuscript in “I think there are two circumstances in which I’ve written outside of the African diaspora,” she says. “In both cases they were pieces of short fiction and the process of writing them took several years, just because of that consultation.” Beneba Clarke believes consultation is crucial, but so is examining your own impulse to write from the perspective of another. “What does it mean to be a writer who is not a minority writer and wanting to diversify your literature? How do you do that? I think that was the opportunity for conversation that was missed [in Shriver speech] ... How do we feel about writing each other stories and how do we go about it? What the respectful way to go about it? There will be people who will tell you that maybe you didn’t quite get this right, and you just have to cop that flack Omar Musa, poet, rapper and novelist “In some ways it comes down to personal ethics,” she says. “Whether you feel you are doing no harm; whether you feel you are doing it sensitively; and, I suppose, whether the publisher or the reader agrees that you have done it sensitively.” Helen Young from the University of Sydney English department says fiction can have a very real impact on marginalised people. “Individual books have an impact on individual lives, but representation overall creates a space and an environment in which people can feel like it OK to be who they are.” The politics of representation is a huge issue in the science fiction and fantasy worlds too, says Young. This was exemplified by the recent campaigns against a perceived leftwing bias in the Hugo awards , in which disgruntled rightwing science fiction and fantasy writers argued the awards were being diminished by what they saw as the tendency of voters to prefer works “merely about racial prejudice and exploitation” and the like over traditional swashbuckling adventures. Referring to the JK Rowling incident, Young says just because fantasy is often thought of as escapist, doesn’t mean those stories don’t matter, or that authors should not treat the source of their inspiration with respect. “They’re still the lived, sacred stories of living cultures,” she says. “They’re the beliefs of real people. So if from a western perspective you go, ‘oh well, it just mythology, I can do whatever I like with it’, that a problem.” In some respects, the ground seems to be shifting. When Kate Grenville wrote her highly acclaimed historical novel about colonial Australia, The Secret River, in she avoided writing from the perspective of Indigenous characters because she felt it was “beyond” her. Speaking to Ramona Koval on ABC radio , she said: “What I didn’t want to do was step into the heads of any of the Aboriginal characters. I think that kind of appropriation ... there been too much of that in our writing.” In her novel The Lieutenant, the sequel to The Secret River, however, Grenville did venture into depicting more rounded Indigenous characters, but only after deep and careful engagement with the historical records upon which her characters were based. Identity politics doesn’t deserve Lionel Shriver contempt, but it can be limiting | Nesrine Malik All the writers who spoke to Guardian Australia say they believe that discussing the issue of cultural appropriation is crucial, but the tenor of that discussion matters. They say that making a mockery of marginalised people concerns about representation and appropriation does not constitute a constructive discussion. Scott, who has previously suggested a moratorium on white authors writing about Indigenous Australia, says white writers could use fiction itself to explore the tension about representation. “Even the desire to inhabit the consciousness of the other, that can be explored in story.” For Musa, the shift needs to go beyond books: “You probably can’t have a change in literary culture without a change in the whole culture of the country,” he says. On the question of progress, in Australia at least, Beneba Clarke says: “There are two schools of thought about this: that Australian literature is not diverse enough for Anglo-Australian writers to be even considering writing from other cultures, and the other school of thought is, well, how do we diversify literature then, given that most of our writers are Anglo-Australian? Are we locking ourselves into an inevitably whitewashed world of literature? “And I don’t really subscribe to either view; I don’t know what the answer is but I can understand both perspectives. But I think what I absolutely can’t understand is disregard for any kind of consultation and an inability to understand when people of colour are outraged.” This article has been amended to clarify that the Hugo awards are voted on by the public.",2221
44,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/26/10-best-debut-novelists-2020-paul-mendez-abi-dare-anappara-elaine-feeney-beth-morrey-douglas-stuart,"Spring is a time for new beginnings in the books world, especially when it comes to fiction – not so much for established authors, who tend to unveil their new work in the autumn, as for fiction debutants hoping to become the next Sally Rooney or Jessie Burton . For the seventh year running the Observer New Review has chosen a select group of first-time British and Irish novelists we believe will make their mark. Our selection procedure was rigorous, with all eligible novels being scrutinised for readability and literary merit by a handful of editors on the New Review. And the class of looks particularly promising. Among those who made the grade were a poet, a journalist, a former teacher and an actor. The subjects they take on range from modern love in Hong Kong, child kidnapping in India and the Japanese marriage breakup industry to the brutality of Thatcher Britain and murder in a women refuge. What makes us so sure these new writers will stand out from the crowd? Our track record speaks for itself. Former New Review debut novelists include both Rooney and Burton, Gail Honeyman, Emma Healey, Oynikan Braithwaite and Sara Collins, winner of this year Costa debut novel award. Two of our chosen writers are Irish, demonstrating that the exciting new wave of Irish writing kicked off by authors such as Rooney and Booker prizewinner Anna Burns is no flash in the pan. And having called in recent years for publishers to address the scarcity of new black and minority ethnic writers, we are delighted to present our most diverse group of first-time authors yet, with four BAME writers out of the Only two are men. Does this mean the days of the Great White Male Author are numbered? We shall see. ‘When I told my family I had a novel coming out, one uncle asked if I’d had a ghost writer’ Paul Mendez Author of Rainbow Milk (Dialogue, April) They say write what you know – and Paul Mendez had plenty of material to draw on for his first novel, Rainbow Milk . Like his protagonist, Jesse, Mendez was raised in the Black Country as a Jehovah Witness, and “disfellowshipped” by the group at Like Jesse, Mendez moved to London and became a male escort and sex worker, part of a journey of self-discovery that forms the core of his beautifully assured book. He spent several years transforming his experiences into fiction: “There were times when to write something directly autobiographical would have simply been to bleed my heart out on to the page,” he says. “There are things that happened to me in it, but the details are far different.” Rainbow Milk will be published by Dialogue Books, a Hachette imprint founded in to publish under-represented voices, headed up by Sharmaine Lovegrove . Mendez had met her at a party in but it wasn’t until he read about Dialogue that he followed up: “I sent her a sprawling manuscript on her first day,” he laughs. Mendez lives in Hampstead and is studying for an MA in black British writing at Goldsmiths. What made you want to be a writer? I was raised studying the Bible with adults – and it the greatest book ever, right? So my literacy accelerated at a very young age. Books have just always been the thing; I’ve never been able to escape words. When did you start writing? I was always encouraged by my English teacher to write, but Witnesses don’t encourage any kind of creative application, so it was a real conflict. I quit an engineering degree in to write. My family isn’t at all literary and when I told them I had a novel coming out, one uncle asked if I’d had a ghost writer. They’re wonderful people – just very different. They’re still Jehovah Witnesses, and they think I’m stupid: I was taught the “truth” and decided to go against that. I’ve tried to give up on them, but I really can’t. They may give up on me after this book comes out – who knows?” What do you think about the world of books and publishing in I think it our great hope! Dialogue Books, Merky Books , Jacaranda Books – all of these imprints are now around, looking for people with different and very valid voices. We’re in a good place. What do you need to work? I need boringness – for nothing to be happening. Have you been mentored or particularly encouraged by anyone? It was a fantastic leap of faith on Sharmaine part to say “I believe in you, you can write – go away and do it.” I needed someone to do that. What books have inspired you to be a writer? James Baldwin – say no more! And Alan Hollinghurst The Line of Beauty : it was one of the things that made me realise I could write through the voice of a gay black protagonist. What books are currently on your bedside table? The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett, Gender Trouble by Judith Butler , and Flèche by Mary Jean Chan . What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers? Keep. Going. What the best and worst thing about being a writer? There two amazing things: being part of a community of brilliant people, and always having the ability to put your thoughts into words. Therapy is great – but it also great to be able to open your laptop and talk to yourself. The worst thing? So far, nothing! Interview by Holly Williams ‘My book was born out of trying to provide answers’ Abi Daré Author of The Girl With The Louding Voice (Sceptre, March) Abi Daré, was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where she planned to study French at the local university. Her mum had other ideas and at the end of one summer holiday in the UK Daré found herself “tricked” into staying on to study law at the London campus of the University of Wolverhampton. These days, she a proper enough Londoner to have moved out to Essex, but wWhen she first arrived, she chronicled her immigrant experience in a blog that drew hundreds of thousands of hits. In fact, it became so successful she had to delete it because she felt her privacy was being invaded. Aside from the importance of not using your real name online, the blog taught her that she could truly write, so she replaced it with fictional stories shared among friends and family. The Girl With the Louding Voice began as the thesis for her creative writing MA at Birkbeck, University of London, and wound up winning the Bath novel award for emerging authors, before being tussled over in a five-way publisher auction. Its heroine is Adunni, a village girl who longs for an education. Instead, she sold into a brutal marriage from which she escapes, only to become trapped as a domestic servant in Lagos, where she haunted by her predecessor disappearance. To save herself, she must find her “louding” voice. The novel has already been chosen for BBC Radio Book Club , and Daré hopes it will shine a light on the plight of the real-life Adunnis who continue to be exploited. How did you come to write this book? As a child, I noticed that a lot of families – including mine – had informal housemaids, many of them uneducated and ill-treated, and as young as eight or When my own daughters got to be that age, I found myself wondering whether it was still happening. I read an article about a who had been scalded with boiling water by the woman who employed her, and what really got to me was that her face was a blur in the photograph. It was to protect her identity, but I thought, who is this girl? What her story? My book was born out of trying to provide answers. What do you think about the world of books and publishing in – rude health or room for improvement? It come a long way. I’ve gone from not seeing books by authors like myself on the shelves to seeing a lot more but publishing is still not representative enough. Where do you write and what is your work schedule? I have a full-time job overseeing app development, so I do a lot on the go. In fact, I’m talking to you from a watch I bought so that I can text myself when I get ideas. I wrote most of The Girl With the Louding Voice in a coffee shop where there was a poster of a girl that the chain foundation was supporting. She had the brightest smile, and it felt like she was saying: “Keep going, do it for me!” What do you need to work? I like background noise when I’m writing and being creative, but I like silence to edit so I go to the London Library, where I was given a wonderful scholarship. I also get quite inspired in the shower. What books have inspired you to be a writer? Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie books showed me that if she could do it, I could. What books are currently on your bedside table? A Woman Is No Man by Etaf Rum and Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens are both on my Kindle. Are you working on your second book and if so what is it about? I am but it at the point where what it about changes every day. I never used to be a plotter but I had a disastrous manuscript a few years ago that was words of nothing, so I at least need to have an end scene in my mind now. Best and worst things about being a writer? The worst thing is when you’re just not able to get the words out. The best? One is obviously writing a story that I enjoy, another is getting good feedback. When people say “I loved this”, or “Your book opened my eyes”, that beats any feeling. Interview by Hephzibah Anderson ‘I come from a background where you’re expected to work for a living, making up stuff is seen as a luxury’ Deepa Anappara Author of Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line (Chatto &amp; Windus, January) Deepa Anappara grew up in Kerala, India, and worked as a journalist for years, in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi, reporting on the impact of poverty and religious violence on the education of children. She moved to the UK in and embarked on an MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia, where she began work on her debut novel, Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line . Submitting extracts of the novel to various prizes for unpublished fiction in the hope that a longlisting might help secure her an agent, Anappara went on to win a host of awards including the Lucy Cavendish fiction prize in which recognises literary merit and “unpoutdownability” and whose previous recipients include Gail Honeyman and Sara Collins. The novel became the subject of a nine-way bidding war and has since sold to international territories and received advance praise from literary figures including Anne Enright and Ian McEwan, a historical novel, as part of her PhD in creative and critical Writing at UEA. What made you want to be a writer? I can’t remember a time when I didn’t want to write. But I come from a background where you’re expected to work for a living so if you sit around making up stuff it seen as a luxury and indulgence that you can’t really afford. So I chose journalism because it allowed me to write and also point to the inequities in the society in which I was born and raised. How did you come to write this book? As a reporter in India, I came across stories about the disappearance of children. More than children had gone missing over two or three years and no action had been taken to find them because these people had no money or political power, and they were being ignored by government institutions. My interest was always in the children stories: I wondered what it would be like to be a child seeing your friends disappear and be aware you’re in danger yourself. If you had to sell the book in a sentence what would you say? It a coming-of-age story about a nine-year-old boy who fancies himself to be a detective and tries to uncover why children are disappearing from his neighbourhood, exploring the impact of a horrific tragedy on a community neglected by the outside world, and the bonds that help people survive difficult times. What do you think about the world of books and publishing in I’d like to see books by more writers of colour and those books get more publicity. I’d like there to be more emphasis on different ways of storytelling. There a difference in how stories are told in different countries and we don’t see that variety. What books have inspired you to be a writer? The first writers I read were in my mother tongue Malayalam. Kamala Das and Sarah Joseph showed me that women writers could, and must, write about subjects that were considered taboo in the conservative society in which I grew up. I read VS Naipaul A House for Mr Biswas at a time when my parents were struggling to put together the money for their own house, and it was the first time I had seen people like us being represented in fiction in English. What single piece of advice would you offer aspiring writers? I heard Anne Enright say that the students of hers who got published were those who didn’t give up and that really stuck with me. You have to keep working, keep trying, keep persisting. Interview by Hannah Beckerman ‘I think I give my friend a headache when I talk about all of my characters’ Elaine Feeney Author of As You Were (Vintage, April) Irish poet Elaine Feeney first novel, As You Were , is set over the course of one week in a chaotic hospital ward – a context rich in both tragedy and comedy. Feeney, who lives in Athenry in west Ireland, has some experience of hospitals, having spent some time in one after complications following the birth of her second son. “The novel went into a completely fictional space, but what I was thinking about was the camaraderie between people who would ordinarily never be together,” she says. Plus, “no one had private rooms, so you hear everything ”. Feeney has already published three collections of poetry and has written as many discarded novels. “There was an anxiety around writing a novel that I didn’t feel around writing poetry, weirdly,” she says. “Also I had my first son quite young – I was only – and poetry was quicker.” What made you want to be a writer? Reading. I was a very isolated, introverted kid, and I loved books. I started off with Hans Christian Andersen, the Grimm Brothers, Black Beauty… . How did you come to write this book? I started to write As You Were around the end of it took four years and it was a hard write. But I had this voice of the narrator, Sinead, and I just kept knocking. What do you think about the world of books and publishing in People are reading books again – we worried it was all screens, but people have gone back to books. Where do you write and what is your work schedule? I teach boys at a Catholic secondary school, and creative writing at the university in Galway, and I have two sons. So I am busy! I plonked my desk in the big open-plan kitchen in our bungalow and I just put headphones on and do the work. It the house I grew up in, so it got a very weird energy. When my parents were selling I said I’d buy it; I like being rooted. What books have inspired you ? Edna O’Brien. Maeve Binchy. The poetry we did in school was extremely important: I found my teens quite hard, and I remember reading Patrick Kavanagh Inniskeen Road which is about isolation – and I discovered: “Oh, this isn’t a unique feeling, you can get through this.” What books are currently on your bedside table? I’m reading a very strange book that came out in the called I Could Read the Sky by Timothy O’Grady. It the tightest prose. What is the best debut novel you’ve read? Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett. It stunning. She also my friend! But we write completely differently: I think I give her a headache when I talk about all of my characters. Are you working on your second book ? I’m interested in the workings of institutions and power in everyday life. My next one is going to be set in a rightwing Catholic school. What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers? Pay it forward if you get a break – don’t be an ass, be nice. HW ‘I wanted to write a book about hope that would make people cry in a happy way’ Beth Morrey Author of Saving Missy (HarperCollins, February) Beth Morrey, grew up in Derbyshire before studying English at Cambridge, and left university with ambitions to become a comedy writer. A career in factual television beckoned instead and she eventually joined the production company RDF Television, rising to become creative director, responsible for shows including The Secret Life of Four-Year-Olds and Drivers . It was while on maternity leave that she decided to embrace her long-held ambition to write a novel and the result, Saving Missy , became the subject of a auction and has since sold in overseas territories. It a book about community, loneliness and unexpected friendships, continuing the trend for “up lit” . What made you want to be a writer? I wanted to see my name on the spine of a book in a bookshop. I’ve always written since I was about five, when I wrote a story about Icarus. I wrote in television but I wanted to be a writer of books. What was the inspiration for Saving Missy ? It was Joss Ackland in First and Last , which was a drama years ago about an old man who walks from Land End to John O’Groats, and who falls en route while his wife is secretly watching him. I found that scene so poignant, and I wanted to capture something about the poignancy and stoicism of old age. The idea grew from there. Then I was pushing a pram around the park and it struck me how many different people I knew there, from all walks of life, and how we’d been brought together by the dogs [we were walking]. So when I was thinking about this protagonist who was lonely and old I thought that if I gave her a dog, that might be the one simple thing that changes her life. If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say? I wanted to write a book about hope that would make people cry in a happy way. Where do you write and what is your work schedule? It very strict. I go for a run and then I write from in a cafe that I love. I like background noise and chatter because I find I can tune in and out of it. And then I come home, have lunch and edit until about when I go and pick up my kids. What books have inspired you to be a writer? About a Boy by Nick Hornby was a huge influence on me. I really like that sparse, puritan prose where it seems straightforward but it not. And Sue Townsend – I grew up with the Adrian Mole books, adored them, read them over and over again. What are the best and worst things about being a writer? The best thing is when stuff comes out of your head that surprises you: that wonderful. The worst thing is the scrutiny. I know that not everyone is going to like my book and I’ve just got to take it on the chin. What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers? Lots of people say: “I’ve got a book in me.” But they never actually get around to it. It hard to get to the end of a book, to write those words. And so I’d say, if you write to that extent then you are a writer, and what happens after that is just luck. HB ‘The best thing about being a writer is the focus that loneliness brings’ Douglas Stuart Author of Shuggie Bain (Picador, August) Douglas Stuart was brought up on a housing estate in Glasgow. His alcoholic mother died when he was he never met his father. He studied textiles in Galashiels and then the Royal College of Art. For the past years, he has lived and worked as a fashion designer in New York, first for Calvin Klein, then Ralph Lauren, then as head of design for Gap. Most recently, he designed for Jack Spade. Shuggie Bain tells the story of awkward, lonely Hugh “Shuggie” Bain and his ambitious, charismatic mother, Agnes, as they try to protect each other – and themselves – amid the brutal destitution of Thatcher Britain. What made you want to be a writer? I always wanted to be a writer. Fashion has provided me with a wonderful life, but I’ve been writing now for years in private, in secret, for myself. I didn’t write this book with any notion of it being published, of it even being read by someone else. What I decided when I turned a few years ago was that it was time to take a sabbatical. I had dreams that were going unanswered and those were dreams of writing. So I took time out to write and showed Shuggie to a friend in publishing and the response has just been phenomenal. If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say? It a love story about two souls trapped in a hyper-masculine world who are struggling to get by, to survive, to love each other. Where do you write and what is your work schedule? I need complete silence, which is very hard to achieve in New York as there construction going on around me all the time. The most important thing that I own is a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and every morning, at about seven, they go on and I immerse myself in my work. I’m an early-morning writer. Because New York is such a cramped real estate market I have to wait for my husband to stop banging coffee mugs and the dishwasher and leave for work. I get up before he gets up in the morning, then I take a couple of hours off to hang out with him, then when he goes off to work I get straight back to it. Best debut you have read? Morvern Callar by Alan Warner . Here was a book where I saw people like myself reflected and I could really empathise with Morvern desire to escape from the world she was in. It knocked me sideways. What books are currently on your bedside table? I’m currently reading And the Land Lay Still by James Robertson. It a book that been out for years or so. I’m also rereading Young Adam by Alexander Trocchi and then also The Trick Is to Keep Breathing by Janice Galloway. A book I’ve just finished and loved is Lowborn by Kerry Hudson. It a wonderful book, such quiet grace. Best and worst things about being a writer? The worst thing is the loneliness, especially coming from an industry which is all about dynamic team-building, and I sometimes find myself feeling isolated, but the best thing is the focus that loneliness brings. So for both sides of the question the answer is loneliness. What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers? Don’t fear if you don’t come from a certain background. Find what it is only you can offer the world and put that on the page. Interview by Alex Preston ‘My ambition is to be a sort of feminist hermit crab’ Jessica Moor Author of Keeper (Penguin Viking, March) Twenty-seven-year-old Jessica Moor lives in Berlin but was born in south-east London and her debut novel, Keeper , started life while she was doing an MA in creative writing at Manchester University, where she was mentored by Jeanette Winterson . A literary thriller, Keeper is a compelling, tense and pacy read, with a central character who works in a women refuge. Moor herself worked for a domestic violence charity for a while after finishing her BA. “It was a bit of a ‘road not taken’,” she says. “I was thinking about training to be a psychotherapist and I needed a day job that would lead to a relevant field. But I was also drawn to it because I’m very much a feminist, although, looking back, I feel like my feminism was quite underdeveloped at that point.” The role developed her thinking. “It made me feel that everything is connected, and that there is a dismissal of women and the control of women bodies that underpins everything… there an ideology behind it and the logical conclusion of that ideology is violence against women.” What made you want to be a writer? I think I decided I wanted to be a writer aged six after reading [Roald Dahl] Fantastic Mr Fox . I used to write lots of stories about cats. There are writers in my family – my parents were TEFL teachers who eventually wrote a series of textbooks for people learning English as a foreign language and my grandfather was a journalist. Your book describes controlling, coercive behaviour. Is this something you have experienced? I’ve certainly felt it in the world around me in my past relationships, and in my friends’ relationships and this was one of the things I understood better after working for the domestic violence organisation – there a continuum of behaviour. It starts with texting, you know, saying: “Where are you? Who are you with? What are you wearing?” Which I and lots of my friends have experienced. It not healthy, but it is common. And that is on a spectrum of behaviour. It entitlement, and it the failure to treat women as fully autonomous beings. What inspired you to write a thriller? I like thrillers. But I mean, I don’t read a huge number of them. The writer that most inspired me was Kate Atkinson because she uses a genre for her own ends. I was also inspired by a lot of the TV that I find exploitative. A non-exploitative example [of a crime thriller], is The Killing , the way that it actually does manage to centre the victim, because it takes you on this ride, you get caught up in the story and then the final shot is the girl gravestone. It incredibly effective. It the opposite of the sort of Sherlockian “the game is afoot” – “Oh great, there a corpse. Now we can have fun unravelling a mystery.” It kind of saying, none of that matters – the girl is dead. How do you find the books industry in I think Bernardine Evaristo winning the Booker is a sign of more great things to come. And you know, the fact that The Testaments coming out was this major event [given] that it is a literary feminist novel, it is everywhere and it is incredible. What the best debut you have read? Anne Michaels Fugitive Pieces was a debut novel, wasn’t it? I think it is a masterpiece. What books are currently on your bedside table? I’m reading Samantha Power The Education of an Idealist at the moment, which I’m massively enjoying. I relate to her a lot, her slightly morbid fascination with the world suffering and a sort of rampant catastrophising. What is your second book about? It historical and, again, my way in is through a violence-against-women lens. My ambition is to be a sort of feminist hermit crab and to go into different genres and unpick them and see what there that may have been suppressed. Interview by Ursula Kenny ‘I kept wondering about that idea: can you love someone and kill them?’ Stephanie Scott Author of What Left of Me Is Yours (Orion, April) Stephanie Scott was born and raised in Singapore. She came to the UK to study English at university, where she specialised in Renaissance literature. Just as she was starting her PhD at Cambridge, she decided that she couldn’t face the idea of “being locked in a garret,” and took a job on the hedge fund desk at Lehman Brothers. Working late nights on deals, she’d dream of becoming a novelist and scan the websites of creative writing courses. She finally took the plunge, applying to study at the Faber Academy and on Oxford University creative writing master programme. “I was accepted on both and so I decided to do both, to really pursue writing seriously.” Scott debut, What Left of Me Is Yours , delves into the murky world of Japanese marriage-wreckers to tell a strange and tragic love story. How did you come to write this book? I read an article by Richard Lloyd Parry of the Times about a real-life crime. In that case a marriage break-up agent had strangled his lover when she discovered his true profession and threatened to leave him. The agent was arrested at the scene and confessed to police, but as he was speaking to the police he said: “I loved her, I love her still.” And it the humanity of that original story that drew me to it. I was newly married at the time and was thinking a lot about love and enduring relationships. I kept wondering about that idea: can you love someone and kill them? Because love ideally requires selflessness, but then I thought perhaps there are as many different types of love as there are people. I spent several years researching and living in Japan, visiting all the locations. I worked on the novel for years and was lucky enough to win a Jerwood award and the Escalator award. I had a lot of agent interest coming through as I worked on the draft, but I wanted to finish it on my own terms. I sent it out when it was ready and had agents interested. It was a bit mad. But then I chose my agent, Anthony Harwood, and within a week of sending it out he’d secured a six-figure pre-empt [offer] from Doubleday. I started laughing and crying like a madwoman down the phone to him. It has sold in eight territories so far. Where do you write and what is your work schedule? I need to be at my desk in my study. I need to know what I’m writing about. A lot of the novel was drafted by just writing what I wanted without planning out where it was going but, having said that, the novel is so research-based that I had to have the grounding in place before I could begin it. Have you been mentored or particularly encouraged by anyone? If so by whom and how? I was taught on the Faber novel course by Louise Doughty and Louise has been hugely supportive of this novel from beginning to end. By the time it comes out it will have been years in the making. She has been an extraordinary mentor. She was instrumental in my finally deciding to leave finance and focus on the book, which was a crazy thing to do at the time. Best debut you have read? My Sister the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite. I absolutely adored it. What single piece of advice would you offer aspiring writers? Persevere and believe in yourself and your project. AP ‘Being a writer helps you make sense of everything else in your life’ Naoise Dolan Author of Exciting Times (Orion, April) At just Naoise (pronounced “Neesha”) Dolan is remarkably self-assured and laid-back about the prospect of becoming a published novelist. “It seems like a nice job to have,” she says breezily. Born in Dublin, she studied English at Trinity College but had never seen writing as anything more than “a hobby I enjoyed, like playing the piano and drawing”, until she took a creative writing course in her final year. “That was a game-changer. I came out of it pretty much saying, ‘I want to write a book’,” she says. A year teaching English in Hong Kong provided the setting and subject matter for Exciting Times , the story of a love triangle that also explores class, colonialism, language and more, while also being frank about female sexuality. Dolan friend Sally Rooney (a couple of years ahead at Trinity), published the first chapter in her literary journal, Stinging Fly , and a seven-way publishers’ scrum ensued. Is she, as the industry buzz suggests, the next Rooney? We’ll see when her novel hits bookshops in April. If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say? I think I’d say it about love, money and the intimate lives of three young cynics living in Hong Kong – and I would do my best to keep a straight face. Where do you write? I try to put as few conditions as possible on what needs to happen for me to be able to write because I find, in practice, that just turns into excuses for me not to write. Ideally, I’m somewhere where there not too much going on in the background. But I have to take a lot of trains because I don’t fly [due to the climate crisis], so I’ve trained myself to be able to write in that situation, too. Otherwise I just lose a day. Is there anything you need to work? I’m completely dependent on coffee but that not writing-specific: I’d be a shell of a human being without it. What books have inspired you to be a writer? I always loved the Victorians. They were pretty much a special interest since my early teens, which is why I did a master in Victorian literature at Oxford after I’d been to Hong Kong. I think of all of them, Dickens has inspired me the most because he has got what very few people have, which is the ability to construct this compelling story but also to write absolutely wonderfully at a line-by-line level. On any page of Dickens you’ve got a really unusual cluster of words or something really funny or true, but you really want to find out what happens next as well. What are the best and worst things about being a writer? Best is having a book always humming in your mind. It really nice, even when something miserable happens in your day, to be able to think, maybe I can work that into the story. It helps you make sense of everything else in your life. Worst is people expecting you to be precious about your book and treat it like your baby, because I am not sentimental like that at all. For my mother, for instance, the idea of me being edited was this offensive thing, while I’m like: “Yeah, let get the scalpel out, let fix it.” What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers? Ignore the whole social performance of being a literary person. That thing of feeling you have to go to book launches or that all your friends have to be writers. That stuff is irrelevant to writing a book and it can take up a lot of your time and money if you let it. It not what makes you a writer. Interview by Lisa O’Kelly ‘I thought, wouldn’t it be great if I could write something that I want to read?’ Louise Hare Author of This Lovely City (HarperCollins, March) Louise Hare, works in the travel industry and did a part-time MA in creative writing at Birkbeck, London University. Her debut novel grew out of a short story written in her first semester. Set in postwar south London, it tells the story of Lawrie – a young Jamaican musician recently arrived on the Empire Windrush – and Evie, the mixed-race girl girl next door with whom he falls in love. Hare herself is mixed race – “half Nigerian, half British” – and grew up in Warrington in Cheshire where she lived with her adoptive (white) parents and brother before moving to London or so years ago. Hare timely story (written before the Windrush scandal was revealed) foregrounds the racism and bigotry the Windrush arrivals encountered. The idea to write about that era took root after a visit Hare made to a deep level shelter below Clapham Common which was used, for a while, to house passengers from the Windrush. “Can you imagine?” she asks. “Being on that boat for ages, getting off and they put you down there.” What made you want to be a writer? About five years ago, I realised that although I don’t hate my job, the thought of doing it for another to years filled me with dread. I thought, if I could find something I really loved what would that be? How much had you written before? There wasn’t that much creative writing at school, so it has always been in my own time. In my a couple of times I sat down to write and just found that I didn’t really have anything to say. It wasn’t until I got to about that I thought, I want to read a different kind of book. I was in a book club at the time with a couple of people who were mixed-race and we were always talking about how the books we wanted to read just didn’t exist. And I thought, well, wouldn’t it be great if I could write something that I want to read? So I spent two years writing a book that now in a drawer somewhere. I sent it out to loads of agents and got some nice feedback including from my now agent, but nobody was interested enough to publish it. That was when I signed up to the MA, to have something to feel positive about and to see if I was actually any good. Do you think the publishing industry is in a better state now? It got better in the last couple of years with books like Queenie [by Candice Carty-Williams] and writers like Sara Collins winning the Costa. That will encourage more black and Asian writers to think “that could be me”. Because it is hard to sit there and think about yourself as a writer when you don’t have many examples, it feels out of reach. Which writers inspired you? I love Sarah Waters books. I like what she does, putting LGBT characters into historical novels. I like Andrea Levy as well. I’ll also say James Baldwin : I read Another Country a couple of times during the writing of this book because it got a lot of jazz in so I wanted to see how he had sort of infused his writing with the music. And I’d also say Marlon James , in terms of current writers. I love what he doing. What books are on your bedside table? I’ve just finished Nora Ephron Heartburn which is very funny. I’ve also got an advance copy of a short story collection by Zora Neale Hurston which is a reissue as well. I’m doing a bit of research for a potential book that I don’t have a story for yet so I’ve got a book called War to Windrush by Stephen Bourne which is about black women in Britain during the second world war. What the best debut you have read? Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi. I thought it was brilliant. You got a six-figure sum for a two-book deal from HarperCollins. What is your second book about? It written already and it set in partly in Soho but mainly aboard the Queen Mary going from Southampton to New York. It a murder mystery.

But she wasn’t particularly self-confident. She was working in a lowly job that she didn’t like, one of a string of jobs since she’d graduated, and she wasn’t really sure what she wanted to do. I was a graphic designer and soon after we got together I made a suggestion – why don’t you work with me? I’ll train you. I was only half serious. She probably quipped “Dunno, what are the hours?”, but she quickly agreed and so began our long partnership. We were partners in every sense, we lived, loved and worked closely together for the rest of her life. Around this time she had her big epiphany , one that she often talked about in interviews. Still working part-time for a charity, she famously crossed the floor during a racism awareness course from the “white” side of the room, beckoned by her black colleagues. After a childhood of evasion and “passing-for-white”, this light-skinned young English woman of Caribbean heritage realised not only that she was black but just what that meant in terms of British history, British society, and her strangely unrepresented place in it. Thomas Kinsman, one of the characters in The Long Song , the last novel that Andrea wrote, describes at the beginning of the book how his mama, a Jamaican woman called July, “… had a story – a story that lay so fat within her breast that she felt impelled, by some force that was mightier than her own will, to relay this tale”. It a description that fits the author herself rather well. Andrea made a good graphic designer, she could think visually and had great ideas; but now she had a story, the story of her own heritage, and she wasn’t going to be able to tell that through graphic design. She began to write. Just little scenes, memories from her childhood. She joined an afternoon-a-week writing course. I guess I would have said nice things whatever she read to me, but I soon found I didn’t need to flatter her. I remember her reading out an early story, just a snippet, where I laughed out loud and then welled up with tears within the space of a single paragraph. Wow, I thought, how did she do that? Since her death earlier this year one of my difficult but strangely uplifting tasks has been to assemble and go through her archive of written material – all her early notes, ideas for novels, research material, tape recordings, character sketches, handwritten drafts, annotated printouts, reworkings, letters, notes to herself. There are crates and crates of material all labelled and box-filed in her careful, slightly cautious manner. Although I know it was done over a long time, years or so, I’m still staggered by the sheer amount of work she did. I was with her all this time but I still can’t quite grasp how, and when, she managed to do it all. We had a full life with friends and family and fun, and problems and crises and heartaches. But in among it all was this fat, fat story that, in a suite of beautiful, powerful novels, she patiently worked through. It was a courageous achievement that in the words of July son, Thomas, she clearly felt impelled to do. When I think about Andrea, of all the rich, complex and loving feelings I have for her memory – her humour, her talent, her humanity – one thing keeps coming to my mind. She was quite simply the most intelligent person I have ever met. Not in the way we sometimes misuse the word, not clever-clever, or self confident, or good at general knowledge (she was none of those), but just a sure-footed thoughtfulness that had such depth, breadth and insight. She was a wise and wonderful woman. At a personal level to say that I miss her doesn’t even come near. At a public, cultural level I know that she is missed by very many people. Through her body of work she has made a small but real difference to Britain view of itself. Right to the end of her life her down-to-earth modesty meant I was never sure if she quite understood or totally accepted that fact. I just hope that she did. The Observer obituaries of features",733

One day, I saw an advert for foster children – and there were photographs of them. I was taken aback by this whole page of children smiling rather desperately and I couldn’t help thinking: “What a horrible thing to see these children advertised like this.” I realised I could write about one of these kids because I could imagine how it must feel. Almost immediately, this feisty little girl came into my head, and Tracy Beaker was born. I called her care home the Dumping Ground and focused the story on Tracy friendships with the other kids living there, all trying to have normal lives in some pretty extraordinary circumstances. Throughout, there was the story of Tracy relationship with her eventual adoptive mother, Cam, as she tries to understand why she ended up in care. The book was published in I can’t say it was an overnight success but it did better than my others and soon a wonderful producer at the BBC , Sue Nott, told me she was desperate to make it into a TV series. She had trouble though: some people believed Tracy wasn’t an aspirational character and wouldn’t be popular, but Sue persisted. A decade after the first book, the show started. I thought they captured its spirit perfectly and Dani Harmer was just superb as Tracy. We were exploring some quite adult themes and I didn’t think it was going to be so big. Years later, though, I was on Blue Peter and they had a huge cardboard cutout of Tracy behind me. I was sitting at her feet, like she’d taken over me. By then, if I walked down the street and people recognised me, they’d call out: “Tracy Beaker!” I wrote several more books about Tracy, eventually moving on to her becoming a mum herself. It would be wonderful if we had Tracy having to go into a home for the elderly, too, bringing her story full circle. But I see Tracy having a wonderful future no matter what, even if it only in my head. Through Tracy, I’ve done all sorts of work with the fostering network. Some kids I met said Tracy raised their status at school. Of course, because the books and shows are aimed at children, you can’t include the whole reality. Being a child in care is no picnic. I was so charmed when I heard that Stormzy had the Tracy Beaker theme tune on his latest album . You couldn’t get a cooler guy to enjoy it. Dani Harmer, who played Tracy I was a big fan of Jacqueline writing and had read lots of her books but not Tracy Beaker. I was at drama school when the casting call came for the show. I had a panic and borrowed a copy, but I didn’t manage to read the whole thing. I still haven’t to this day! They had struggled to find someone to play Tracy and I just showed up and shouted a lot, was quite stroppy, and had this big curly hair. I got the part and it was huge for me – I was only I had to learn a lot of lines but I really enjoyed myself. Since the episodes were only minutes long and ran straight after school, I wasn’t sure anyone would watch it, but it went on to be huge. Tracy Beaker, please never grow up | Claire Armitstead We would get messages saying we were giving looked-after kids a voice, especially younger ones. It made me so happy. I still get people reaching out to me. Growing up as a teenager on screen is hard though. It wasn’t the most flattering thing – to see myself on TV with braces and feeling awkward. And you can’t show all the aspects of real life on kids’ TV, so when I got to I left. I wanted to spread my wings, though I came back years later to play Tracy as a social worker. It so lovely that the show is on iPlayer now so people in lockdown can relive their childhoods. My sister finds it really funny to put it on in front of my daughter, but she just gets confused.

Out this September, the children picture book Sweet Child O’Mine “celebrates love and music, and how they bring us together in the sweetest ways”. Patterson, who described himself as “a longtime fan of Guns N’ Roses”, is teaming up with illustrator Jennifer Zivoin to produce the book, which will “follow a child wondrous discovery that music is everywhere around us – from the gentle wind blowing through the bluest skies, to the fearful crash of the thunder and the rain”. It sounds rather charming, and will almost definitely leave many a parent humming away after bedtime stories. Who knows where it may lead? Will Patterson and Slash move on to a jungle-set adventure series (“Welcome to the jungle / we’ve got fun and games”) or perhaps an urban fantasy based on Paradise City? While this is an unexpected collaboration, Patterson is a seasoned co-author, having worked with tens of other writers on his bestselling adventure thrillers . And collaborations have a fine literary history, whether it the then little-known Neil Gaiman teaming up with Terry Pratchett for Good Omens, Stephen King and Peter Straub creating something strange and compelling in The Talisman, or William Gibson and Bruce Sterling writing The Difference Engine. It not as if Guns N’ Roses are the first musicians to turn one of their songs into a children book. Paul McCartney already been there, with last year Hey Grandude! Then there Ringo Starr Octopus Garden, Keith Richards Gus &amp; Me, and Pharrell Williams Happy! Sweet Child O’ Mine was probably the right Guns N’ Roses song to turn into a children book.

49,books,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/11/juno-dawson-trans-alice-wonderland-interview-spice-girls,"lice dyes her hair blue and has an “active, app-based sex life with married men from outlying commuter towns”. This is not how heroines in young adult novels usually describe themselves, but then Alice is no ordinary heroine. She a pupil at an elite girls’ school, “an angry child crayon sketch of a human girl” whose self-harming is a cry of rage against what she perceives as a cosmic injustice: “Some lazy angel, desperate for a fag break, scribbled the wrong gender on my destiny forms.” Before long, author Juno Dawson has whisked her heroine down a rabbit hole for an adventure that is both a retelling of Alice in Wonderland and an investigation of what might constitute reality in a society where money, power and celebrity are swept up in an ever crazier whirl of gossip, cocaine and cosmetics. But the central question of Wonderland is sane and sober, echoing that of Lewis Carroll original: “Who in the world am I? Ah, that the great puzzle.” Nestling on a sofa in her living room with Prince, her sleepy chihuahua, Dawson looks like she knows exactly who she is, but the author is all too aware of what it like to be a victim of that lazy angel. Like her Alice, Dawson is transgender . But while Alice has transitioned by the time she starts secondary school, it wasn’t until Dawson was a well-known author in her (crowned Queen of Teen in a reader-led YA prize) that she felt ready to take the plunge, changing from James to Juno. She came out publicly in and, three years later, created her first transgender character: Kendall, a gentle anorexic, in what was to become her most successful novel, Clean . Kendall was a minor character, but Alice commands her own story. It was during an Australian book tour for Clean that the idea of appropriating Alice in Wonderland popped up. “There was this exhibition in Melbourne about visual representations of Alice,” says Dawson, speaking via Google Hangouts. “I realised we have a globally agreed idea of what this character looked like. I began to wonder what I could bring to the table. There’ve been Japanese Alices and black Alices. Would people accept her if she was trans? I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it just be superfun to do it my way?” Though the novel is freestanding, it part of “a loose trilogy” with Clean and Meat Market , both of which are set in rarefied circles defined by glamour and wealth. Meat Market tackles the fashion trade, while Clean is set in an elite rehab centre, where a group of moneyed misfits grapple with the fallout from privileged lives, all very different from Dawson own childhood. “I grew up in a council house near Bradford watching TV serials like Beverly Hills and, later on, Gossip Girl ,” say s the “It seemed as if drama was a thing rich people had. Our dramas were much more mundane – my mum walking out on my dad – whereas these people were having poisoning-your-spouse dramas.” Wonderland is hinged around a weekend-long, invitation-only house party that is reached by secret invitation through the cellar of a club. At this club, a murderous Queen of Hearts (AKA Paisley Hart, poisonous ringleader of St Agnes girls’ school) rules over a trippy “court” of half-recognisable Carrollian archetypes. Alice is shadowed by a mysterious character in a cat hoodie, while the Tweedle twins are social media influencers with an abusive sexual interest in transgender girls. For those who think a YA label is akin to a PG film rating, the novel explicitness might seem startling. The story feels its way around the differences between the male and female orgasm, and is unflinching in its approach to date rape – the bewildering moment when consent is breached. “The twins press against me,” Dawson writes, “their bodies hard and wet. Firm hands grab at my breasts, pull on my nipples. If it was right, would there be so many questions, so many wasps at the picnic?” Asked if she gets any pushback, Dawson breaks into an ironic chuckle. Her self-help manual, This Book Is Gay , was once challenged by an Alaskan parent who discovered it in a children section of the local library. “But if anyone thinks teens aren’t experimenting with drugs and looking at porn, all that stuff, they’re kidding themselves.” Market research for Clean revealed that many of the most enthusiastic readers of YA fiction are in their anyway, suggesting it is less a safety zone than a space where young people go to have their concerns reflected back to them. Dawson isn’t alone in using this space to explore gender and sexuality. She recently gathered several of her LGBTQ+ peers together for a short-story anthology, Proud, which has just been judged book of the year in the Visionary Honours for diverse and underrepresented voices. Wonderland is also a wake-up call to anyone who believes gender reassignment might be a happy-ever-after. Alice has recently returned to school after three months in hospital following a suicide attempt. “While I’m delighted with my perky little boobs,” she says, “I was profoundly disappointed that my urge to cut myself didn’t vanish with the first milligram of oestrogen to pass my lips.” Her problems, Dawson points out, are those of all too many young women. “When I’m at the Hay book festival or at Yale, these teenagers come into my signing queues and they are scarred . It must be talked about because it permanently affects girls.” In her autobiographical book The Gender Games , published in Dawson described a lifestyle in which sexual risk-taking became a damaging form of self abuse. “Some people take scissors to their skin and some choose terrible men,” she tells me. “I was on top of my drinking and I never cut myself, but throughout my I engaged in these awful relationships. I really put myself at risk, when I really just wanted people to like me.” The Tweedle twins’ prurient fascination with Alice is a reflection of the author own experience, which culminated in a “slightly sordid” dalliance with an unnamed Premier League footballer. “What do you get the millionaire who has everything?” she wrote. “Apparently this is where I come in.” Dawson recalls it all now with a shrug. “As a young trans woman doing internet dating , you’re going to attract heterosexual men, when all they are really interested in is that you’re a very specific body type.” It was not OK for a boy to like the Spice Girls as much as I did – but I couldn’t keep it in The Gender Games traced Dawson dysphoria back to her early childhood in the Yorkshire town of Bingley, “famous as the birthplace of the Damart thermal underwear empire”. Her mother worked for the Bradford and Bingley building society while her father was a travelling salesman for Cadbury. They divorced when she was seven. “Barbie, Girls World Styling Heads and My Little Ponies were my catnip,” she recalled. She would steal her sister comics and amuse herself by writing stories about characters she cut out of her mum home-shopping catalogues. Then she discovered the Spice Girls in and had her “true female awakening”. She says: “It was not OK for a boy to like the Spice Girls as much as I did, but I couldn’t keep it in. In fact, the day I first told anyone I thought I was gay was the day I bought the single Stop in At Bingley Grammar School (“a grammar school in name only”) she was bullied into conforming to male stereotypes with the result that, while compensating by overperforming academically, “by the time I was a teenager, I felt almost entirely like I’d failed at being human”. Whereas Alice has landed at St Agnes through the fluke of having a bestselling crime-writer for a mother, a scholarship paid for Dawson to join a stage school. She was the first in her family to go on to higher education, landing a place at Bangor university in north Wales, where she studied psychology, dabbled in acting and music reviewing, and decided that fame might be the answer. She auditioned for Pop Idol, The X Factor and Big Brother (twice) before realising that “fame is Diet Love. It tastes like love and looks like love but there no real love in it.” After starring as the straight, male, American romantic lead in “an Edinburgh fringe disaster”, she decided that the life of a jobbing actor was not her bag either, so settled down to a career as a primary school teacher. For seven years she lived a double life, teaching by day and pursuing a wild, app-based sex life by night. It wasn’t until she started interviewing people for This Book is Gay that she “began to join the dots”. She came out in an interview with the news website Buzzfeed the day after Germaine Greer declared on Newsnight that “transgender women are not women” – and two years later took revenge by pulling out of a book festival in protest at the inclusion of Greer. Although she is a fearless champion of trans rights, she is sympathetic towards those who are less courageous, saying: “Look what happened to poor Lucy Meadows , who was a primary teacher like me. She was hounded until she killed herself.” Her pre-Juno life is present in the exotic tattoos that cavort up her arms. “Had I known I was going to transition, would I have had quite so many?” she muses. “You’d be surprised how badly tattoos can clash with a wedding dress.” It a reminder that the coronavirus lockdown has not only laid waste to the launch schedule for Wonderland, but has forced the postponement of her wedding to Max Gallant, originally scheduled for June. “It was sad because I was due to have my final dress fitting the following week,” she says. “But we said to each other very early on that it about the marriage not the wedding.” Today, Dawson combines writing a novel a year with what she calls “my hyphens”. These include screenwriting (she has five TV projects in development), a lifestyle podcast based on questions raised by Sex and the City Carrie Bradshaw, and a cult cabaret night, Club Silencio , which takes place four times a year in a former sex dungeon beneath a railway arch in Brighton. Her social circle ranges from her “straight, white fiance”, with whom she bought a house in West Sussex last year, to a WhatsApp group of young trans women who – like Alice – were able to transition before going through a male puberty. “Do I envy them? Of course. I was absolutely a product of Section , which became law the year I went to primary school and was revoked the year I went to university.” Introduced by Margaret Thatcher in Section barred the “promotion” of homosexuality in schools “so there was nobody talking about what it was like to be a queer person”. There a telling scene in Wonderland when Alice finds herself in the bathroom with a gaggle of coke-sniffing flower girls. “Did you have a sex change?” they chorus. “Do you sit down when you pee?’, ‘Do you think trans people should have a special toilet?’ ‘Do you think rapists might pretend to be trans to rape people in toilets?” Alice is not playing. “I add one question of my own,” she says, wearily. “Um … can I just use the toilet, please?” Such questions are the curse of transgender life – and are one of the reasons why Dawson has taken to describing herself as queer. “However banal my life is,” she says, “it always going to encompass that otherness because of my gender. Unless I try to pass myself off as cisgender, I’m always going to be on the outside.” Wonderland is published on May by Quercus .",1994
0,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/15/mike-tyson-comeback-talk-boxing-barney-ronay,"ike Tyson wants to make a comeback. And who can blame him? So do I. So do you. So does the retail industry, going to school, having fun, being a grandparent, having a job and going to the corner shop without standing outside in a face mask looking like a socially awkward moped thief. In Tyson case it seems unlikely the comeback talk amounts to a serious plan, at least not one that will extend beyond some kind of hairspray-and-steroids boxer-tainment. Tyson is years old. No matter how good he looks hitting the pads – and of course he does: this is a man with a kind of magic in his hands – the prospect of anyone that age absorbing heavyweight punches is pretty grim. My favourite game: Holyfield v Tyson, WBA heavyweight title fight | Kevin Mitchell But the Tyson-comeback baloney is also in its own way a perfect lockdown story, an ideal confection of nostalgia and viral oddity – with an eerie synchronicity for anyone who, like me, has spent their confinement watching every single one of Tyson professional fights in series like a soap opera. Or at least, I’ve tried to watch the whole thing and failed. Albeit in a way that seems to speak to that fantasy comeback talk. In the event I haven’t been able to get past the cold white heat of early Mike: those months that took him from dowdy halls in upstate New York to the Las Vegas Hilton, the total destruction of Trevor Berbick and enthronement as the youngest heavyweight champion of all time. Has there ever been a run like this in sport? From March to November Tyson fought unbeaten fights, winning by knockout, boxing only completed rounds, and producing a sequence of such clarity, such gathering greatness, it is still startling to watch. When you’ve touched this … well, of course some part of you always wants to go back. What is also striking now is the quiet nobility of his opponents, that run of pressed men and passing ships, wreathed in a fraternal quality of sweat and ring-ritual and squeaky-floored backwoods gyms. Larry Sims in Poughkeepsie, Sammy Scaff at Felt Forum, Steve Zouski at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum – guys with toughness and skill, but also with sagging chests and floppy guts, a time before abs, before muscle definition – getting in the ring with this force of destiny. This is the first thing about young Tyson: his physical beauty. He looks, from the start, almost like an embarrassment of human splendour, not only slabbed and ripped, with a back like a sand-smoothed granite cliff face, but toned and balanced and gleaming with potential energy. The first fight, patient zero, is Hector Mercedes at the Plaza Convention Center in Albany, New York. The two men face up. Tyson throws punches in seconds. Mercedes falls like a Victorian chimney stack. Tyson rushes over and apologises. Next up is Trent Singleton in the same ring, same kit, same gloomy lighting. Tyson throws two punches. We see that famous left hook for the first time, which is more than Singleton did. At which point it is worth saying something about The Run. Tyson wasn’t fighting cardboard cutouts. The guys were older and more experienced, standard obstacles for a teenage prospect. They just happened to have stepped in front of a talent that is literally impossible to resist, fall guys in one of sport most brutal and apparently unforeseen sequence of mismatches. There are still some wonderful highlights. Tyson is thrown in the deep end with Michael Jack Johnson at the Atlantis hotel, a man with a ragged scowl and a run of knockouts. Tyson walks through him like he a bead curtain. Next comes a bigger step up against Donny Long, AKA “the master of disaster”. Long is cool and good-looking. “I can punch better than Tyson,” he schmoozes. “This is a big win to let everyone know Donny Long is back.” But Donny Long is not back. He is instead battered through the ropes twice in seconds. The Guys fight back. James “Quick” Tillis takes Tyson rounds in Glens Falls, New York. But three months and four fights later Tyson has a title shot eliminator with Marvis Frazier, son of Joe. Marvis has an entourage. Marvis looks mean. Marvis is cut down like a dying dandelion. Tyson is in full peak‑era black trunks and boots by now. Afterwards, he talks about how he decided to incorporate the jab into his style. Lol. And so to the Vegas Hilton, November Berbick is the WBC world champion. He an ordained minister who calls himself the Soldier of the Cross. Later he will be convicted of raping his child babysitter and end up being brutally murdered outside a church by his nephew. He makes the mistake of going toe to toe with the Tyson. He hits the canvas, leaps up like a madman, but ends up skittering across the ring on elastic legs, the most knocked-out man in the history of being knocked out. From the Vault: Mike Tyson is knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas And that was it for The Run. There was still time to beat Michael Spinks in seconds, a career high. But things began to fall apart. There were troubles, excess, bad behaviour. The Buster Douglas defeat came three years later. Six years after Hector Mercedes, Tyson was arrested for rape, convicted, and gone. There isn’t much left to say about this. Tyson has always been a deeply flawed human, and there will always be pain in that, mainly for those on the other end. Watch The Run and there is another kind of sadness in the glory of Young Tyson, who was, or should have been a role model, a hard-working kid from a tough background, a student of his art under Cus D’Amato, funny, smart and courteous, obsessed only with angles and skills and ring craft. Think of that Tyson now and there is even a doomed kind of glory in that crazy talk of a comeback; in the sight of this aged fighter still hitting a bag, still wanting more, wanting even now to go back.",1032

He added: “It not the way a leader should act. There a sort of diplomacy that you need to have, and I don’t think he showing that, especially in these times.” The world No who faced intense backlash after playing a round of golf with Trump shortly after he was inaugurated in admitted the president was “charismatic” and had an “X factor” but said he wouldn’t play with him again if asked. “I don’t know if he’d want to play with me again after what I just said, but I wouldn’t [play with him again],” said McIlroy, who resides in the Florida town of Palm Beach not far from Trump Mar-a-Lago resort. “I felt I would have been making more of a statement if I had turned it down. It was a round of golf and nothing more.” The Northern Irishman is teaming with Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff to raise money for coronavirus charities with Sunday TaylorMade Driving Relief – a two-team skins challenge over holes – at Seminole Golf Club in Juno Beach.

It is understood there had been disagreement between organisers and over the appropriate level of financial recompense to meet the circuit costs. But they have now reached a deal and, subject to government restrictions, will host back‑to‑back races at the end of July and early August. Silverstone has been clear it was willing to host the races, one of which would be the British Grand Prix, but that without fans to meet costs it required an acceptable commercial arrangement. Silverstone managing director, Stuart Pringle, said: “I am delighted to confirm that Silverstone and have reached an agreement in principle to host two races behind closed doors this summer. “However, these races will be subject to government approval, as our priority is the safety of all involved and strict compliance with regulations. We would like to thank all our fans who have been so supportive throughout this and to assure them we are determined to do all we can to help put on a show this summer.” Agreement had not been a foregone conclusion despite eagerness to build a calendar with as many races as possible when racing resumes. chief executive officer, Chase Carey, pointedly observed: “Whether it the teams or promoters or sponsors we’re not going to be handing out candy to everybody.” There has yet to be any formal communication of the deal from The sport has already had to waive hosting fees for meetings held behind closed doors and will be expected to at least meet costs for the circuits involved, which increasingly appears likely to be most of the European races. The season is scheduled to start in Austria on July, with two races back-to-back behind closed doors. Silverstone would then host meetings on July and August. Hungary will also be a closed-door meeting and while Spa was given the go ahead this week to take place on August, it too will have to do so without fans. The season getting under way also remains subject to potential restrictions. The government has imposed a quarantine period for entry into the UK which would make travel almost unmanageable for the seven teams based here if it was still in place in July or they were not to be granted an exemption.

England were due to visit Japan – where Wales were to start at the end of next month – before travelling to New Zealand, Ireland had a series in Australia and Scotland were scheduled to face the World Cup holders, South Africa. Review calls for Premiership salary cheats to be stripped of titles “Extended travel and quarantine restrictions that apply to numerous countries, and concerns over adequate player preparation time, mean that any sort of cross-border international rugby competition cannot be hosted in July,” World Rugby said in a statement . “Monitoring of the potential impact on the remaining international windows continues in full collaboration with international rugby stakeholders and the respective authorities. All parties, including member unions, international competitions, professional club competitions and international players, will be involved in the continued evaluation of potential contingency options with a view to achieving an aligned calendar for the remainder of the year. “All decision-making will be entirely contingent on national government travel, quarantine and health advice and important player welfare and hosting considerations in line with return-to-rugby guidance recently published by World Rugby.” World Rugby has been looking at staging the tours in October just before the start of the November internationals in Europe, with all the major unions hit hard financially by sport lockdown. Australia, which has made significant cuts, has received more than from World Rugby emergency relief fund. “The financial implications of the virus have been significant for us and this emergency relief funding will provide us with certainty for the next months and enable us to close off our accounts,” said Rugby Australia acting chief executive, Rob Clarke. “The funding, in combination with the extensive cuts made across the business, provides us with the short-term impetus to see through the pandemic but does not solve all of the challenges.” Ackermann quits Gloucester for role in Japan Gloucester have announced their head coach, Johan Ackermann, has resigned after three years in charge and will join the Japanese club NTT Docomo Red Hurricanes in July.

The Carlsen Tour effectively replaces the over-the-board Grand Tour organised from St Louis in the US, which was halted by coronavirus. The Carlsen series could even open up the possibility, if coronavirus continues for a long time, of moving the world championship match itself to an internet setting. The first Carlsen Tour event has already happened. The Carlsen Invitational , where the No defeated the US champion, Hikaru Nakamura, in a tense final, was watched by an online audience calculated at Chess: Vishy Anand ambushes Russia world No to win in five minutes The next tournament, from May to June, is the Lindores Abbey Challenge, a version of the over-the-board rapidplay in Scotland last summer. Carlsen opponents will include Nakamura, China world No Ding Liren, and the prodigy Alireza Firouzja. That competition starts on Tuesday but before then the Norwegian will be in action again, this time in a blitz tournament, the Fide Steinitz Memorial, to commemorate the first world champion birth date. The choice may seem tenuous, for chess clocks came into general use only in the and there is no record of Steinitz ever playing blitz. Games are live on , starting at on Friday when Carlsen meets the eight-time Russian champion Peter Svidler. Carlsen and/or Carlsen events will be on your internet screen for at least days from now until August. It should be a great feast of free entertainment and grandmaster commentary for chess fans, but the sheer quantity of games in a short period sparks the question whether at some stage viewer fatigue will creep in. The over-the-board Grand Tour promoted by Rex Sinquefield and Garry Kasparov from St Louis ran for five years from to though with longer intervals between tournaments, and interest seemed to wane towards the end. If that ennui occurs at some stage to the Carlsen Tour at a time when there is still no visible prospect of over-the-board chess resuming in a significant way, then pressure may develop to play the second half of the abandoned candidates tournament and even the world championship match itself as internet competitions. That would be a radical plan and would be fiercely resisted by traditionalists, but normal over-the-board chess, with opponents seated opposite each other for an extended period, may yet come to be viewed as an enduring health risk. China narrowly edged out the US in the online Nations Cup final last weekend, halving the final match but winning the trophy because of their superior performance in the previous rounds. The powerhouses for the winning teams were China Yu Yangyi, who totalled and America world No Fabiano Caruana, who did even better with an unbeaten Both scored with attacks against the king in direct encounters with their rivals. It was interesting that Caruana, confronted with the solid Petroff chose the well worn attacking system with a knight exchange at and castling long which sometimes peters out to a draw but sparked a crushing assault .

5,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/15/talking-horses-ireland-latest-country-cleared-to-race-from-early-june-horse-racing,"acing in Ireland has been cleared to resume behind closed doors on June, three weeks earlier than initially scheduled under the Irish government plan to ease its coronavirus lockdown. The sport lobbying to be exempted from a ban on all professional sports until June proved successful. The news means that, if the British Horseracing Authority plans to resume from June also succeed, all of Europe major racing nations will be back in action by mid-June. British racing fixture list revealed for June with meetings at seven tracks As in Britain, Ireland will resume under strict protocols to stop the spread of Only key personnel will be allowed on course, “all attendees will be subject to health screening in advance and thermal temperature screening on arrival”, and “anyone presenting with elevated temperatures will be denied access and instructed to consult with their GP”. Face masks will be mandatory for jockeys and stalls handlers as well as medical and security staff, while “social distancing will be strictly enforced by a dedicated protocol officer at each fixture”. There was anger and dismay within Irish racing when it emerged that racing had been bracketed with some other major sports and banned until phase three of the government steady unwinding of the lockdown. Its switch to phase two, which starts on June, was approved at a cabinet meeting on Friday morning. “It was reassuring that the importance of horse racing as an industry was fully appreciated,” Brian Kavanagh, the chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said on Friday. “The industry supports jobs in rural Ireland, and we are the third largest producer, and largest exporter, of thoroughbreds in the world, all of which depends on racing taking place on track. “These will not be race meetings as you might traditionally imagine them, rather stripped-back events which will determine the best horses in various categories, a vital factor for the breeding industry.” HRI will release a revised fixture list until the end of June, including confirmation of dates for its major Classics, on Sunday. Greg Wood Yorkshire winner Uncle Steve is fancied for Hong Kong The road to Hong Kong goes through East Yorkshire, or at least it did for Uncle Steve , who can land the feature race on Sha Tin Sunday morning card. Now five, the miler achieved the first success of his career at Beverley a couple of summers back, when he was named Court Of Justice and trained by David Simcock. He won a couple of races at Sha Tin in his first year there and looks ready to make it three, judging by his latest effort. He was given plenty to do but stayed on powerfully into third, faring easily best of the hold-up runners, and it is encouraging to see Chad Schofield take over from a claimer in the saddle. The extra furlong should also help and Uncle Steve can hopefully provide the highlight of a card to be screened by Sky Sports Racing. After seven winners in the past fortnight, including a shot in midweek, John Moore evidently has a few of his horses in a good place and this may be the time to side with his Aeroflash . A steady improver since joining Moore in midseason, he should appreciate this step up in trip. Jerry Chau made an immediate impact with two winners from four rides last weekend and his claim could help Goko to a fifth course and distance success. Winless for a year, the speedster has dropped back in rating and grade and showed promise last time until tiring in the sixth furlong. Few of these are begging to be backed but Judy Star has been knocking on the door and still looks unexposed. He was given a lot to do last time behind a winner who made all, and a new rider gets a chance here. After steady progress in his initial runs, All For St Paul showed real promise when runner-up here four weeks ago, beaten only by Team Power, who is fancied later on the card. Another good effort seems likely in a winnable contest, though his draw is tricky for a front-runner. He last scored in but Winning Controller has three wins at this course to his name and is attractively rated these days. His fourth at Happy Valley last month, following a six-month break, was one of his best efforts at that track, even though the six furlongs was too sharp. He could be a source of value, with much attention sure to be paid to Chevalier Prince after a flashy debut. The step up to six furlongs did not work out for War Of Courage three weeks ago, though he still put up a classy effort to be third and the winner has since gone in again. Returned to the sprint course on which he has such a fine record, and drawn on what is often the favoured side, he is the one to beat. Good View Clarico has won his last two but this is a step up in class. Moore has another chance here with Awe , who was with William Haggas when first home on the wrong side in the Britannia at Royal Ascot last summer. After a few quiet runs in Hong Kong, he showed promise when blinkers were fitted last time, running on over too short a trip. This is a step up in grade for Team Power but he looks ready for it, judging by how he relished a first attempt at this distance here last month. The chestnut, who overcame some trouble in running that day, is well drawn to take an early position. A slow start followed by traffic issues killed off Mig Energy chance a fortnight ago but Tony Cruz youngster stayed on well into third. There a race in him when he gets better luck, though he’ll need some from stall here. Inner Flame is a threat to all if he behaves better in the stalls than last time. Chris Cook",1002
6,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/15/game-on-why-darts-without-an-audience-will-never-hit-the-bullseye,"verything was different. The dartboards were electronic. The players were standing in their living rooms. There was no crowd, no raucous singing and the closest thing to fancy dress was the master of ceremonies, John McDonald, who had decided to wear a suit and tie but no shoes. Yes, everything was different, in all ways but one: when it came to the crunch, Phil Taylor prevailed, beating the rising star Fallon Sherrock on Thursday night in the latest Darts From Home exhibition. It was a wonderful match, as these things go. Taylor clinched it with a checkout in the final leg, having trailed for most of the contest. Sherrock left empty-handed despite registering a paranormal three-dart average of and twice coming close to a nine-dart finish. Even making allowances for the soft-tip board, with its appreciably larger treble and double segments, Sherrock offered plenty to suggest that she has been making extremely profitable use of her lockdown time. My favourite game: Van Gerwen v Van Barneveld, PDC World Championship | Rob Smyth The pandemic arrived at a particularly inauspicious moment for the from Bletchley. Fresh from her seismic achievements at Alexandra Palace in December , where she became the first woman to win a match at the world championship, Sherrock appeared on course to cement her position as the sport coming force. In February, as a guest challenger, she claimed a stunning draw against Glen Durrant in the Premier League. And yet without a tour card, her only real source of improvement – and income – has been the exhibition circuit, which like everything else is at a standstill. The US Darts Masters at Madison Square Garden, at which she was scheduled to compete in June, has been postponed until An underlying kidney problem means she remains confined to her house with her six-year-old son, Rory, even as lockdown eases. The punctures and pockmarks in her living-room wall indicate she has been spending a good deal of that time pounding the practice board. Sherrock will be some player one day, as she demonstrated here in taking out a brilliant checkout in the second leg and immediately following it up with a break of throw. Even throwing against the darts in the deciding leg, she produced back‑to-back briefly threatening to steal the match with a nine-dart finish. A little killer instinct and a little poise on the big doubles are all she lacks for now. Taylor was certainly rattled. A good measure of this was the extent to which the world champion was chatting at the oche. “Good darts, duck,” he kept encouraging his opponent: a reminder that even three years into his competitive retirement and at a distance of miles, he remains the king of mind games. He was playing in front of a glass cabinet filled with chintzy vases and carrying a little extra timber; for all the privations Taylor may have faced during lockdown, getting groceries delivered does not appear to have been one of them. Above all, you sense that more than most, Taylor has always craved an audience. A crowd at his back was the wind in his sails, and whether they were cheering him or jeering him seemed not to matter very much. This is his third home exhibition in quick succession, having played Raymond van Barneveld and Mikuru Suzuki in recent days, but perhaps his most noteworthy public appearance of the pandemic has been to star in a faintly tragicomic viral video in which he ventured on to his front doorstep to clap for the prime minister, who at the time was sick with the virus. “Come on Boris,” he says in the video, applauding meatily and entirely on his own. “I haven’t got the Power – you have. Come on, pal.” All good, clean, physically distanced fun. And yet even in these semi-serious encounters it is possible to get a glimpse of the near future: the sterile, contactless sport that awaits us in the coming months. Darts has been well ahead of the curve in adapting its product to the new landscape, the Professional Darts Corporation swiftly organising a Darts At Home tournament featuring most of the top players, as well as celebrity versions featuring Premier League footballers such as Declan Rice and James Maddison. Even so, something doesn’t feel quite right. Darts should be the easiest sport to play remotely and yet it still feels somehow bloodless and antiseptic. Oche computer: Darts at Home shows vital importance of bells and whistles Even with all the usual accoutrements – Dave Clark and Mark Webster providing analysis on Sky Sports, the regular commentators Stuart Pyke and Wayne Mardle calling the shots – you are reminded of how reliant the sport is on the swelling tide of the live audience, the carefully assembled tableau, the gladiatorial combat. Herein, perhaps, lies a lesson for all sports trying to recreate their old magic for a new age. Since its very earliest days, sport has never simply been a pursuit of numbers and outcomes. It is a congregation, an ensemble production, the act of being in a place, all together. That haptic sensation will be perhaps the biggest loss of all. Even darts, as it turned out, was a contact sport all along.",875

I can’t even say for sure I watched it on television but I have the DVD and that good enough for me. Not only is this the greatest rugby union match – minutes of unremitting, exhilarating, rugged brilliance – it also contained the most magnificent passage of play in all of TV-recorded sport: Gareth Edwards “greatest try”. That fourth-minute touchdown for the Barbarians must have been heart-thumpingly beautiful to watch in the flesh at Cardiff Arms Park as the roars from the crowd attest. But with the sound on at home and Cliff Morgan commentating, it might, if anything, have been better. Unless you have lived a monastic existence then you’ll surely have seen (and heard) it, even if only in hazy YouTube footage . It a breathtaking, unbroken play that begins with Phil Bennett scrabbling to pick up an awkwardly bouncing ball in front of his posts, from where he executes three of the most exquisite sidesteps to set off a pulsating move that ends with Edwards diving desperately over in the corner at the other end of the field. Nothing in sport has come close to that thrill. Carlos Alberto perfect goal for Brazil in the World Cup final bears comparison – for its excellence, its building excitement and its wonderful finish – but the try stands alone. I was nine at the time and I’ve seen it countless times since. I never tire of watching it, never lose touch with the excitement. The miracle of the match, however, was that several other moves almost equalled its brilliance, not least halfway through the first half when only a last-ditch tackle by Alistair Scown stopped John Bevan from going over for the Barbarians after David Duckham – blond English darling of the Welsh spectators – had executed his own sidesteps from the line to beyond halfway. He released Tom David, Fergus Slattery and then Willie John McBride before the backline advanced with speed and adventure. Barbarians 'greatest try' against All Blacks is relived years on | Andy Bull Duckham, adding a dummy to his dazzling routine, again crashed through from his own half shortly afterwards, setting up a superb move that finished with an extended overhead pass by Slattery to John Dawes, who dived over into the same corner – only for it to be disallowed for a forward pass. Then another sensational moment; Bevan this time securing a real try after a Slattery interception and a wonderful, elusive run. The Baa-Baas were up but after the interval New Zealand – who had been fantastic in the first minutes – began the fightback with Grant Batty, Sid Going and the captain, Ian Kirkpatrick, to the fore. Although a friendly, this was no exhibition match: there were high tackles, shoving matches and punches thrown, and the All Blacks were looking to avenge their home series defeat to the British &amp; Irish Lions, of whom were in the Barbarians side. Two lovely scores from Batty (that corner again) brought them into contention at and so it was not only a momentous spectacle but a tense one too, with the pressure released just a few minutes from time when Duckham made another scintillating burst before the ball found its way to a wriggling Mike Gibson and then on to the wing for the bravest of the brave, JPR Williams, to fly into the corner. The final whistle, the scoreline a good old pitch invasion and a celebration of a festival of brilliance. No retrospective verdicts about the folkloric greatness of this game: everyone – delirious fans in the crowd and weary players on the pitch – knew exactly what they had taken part in. I had not even been to Wales at that point but in the DVD I feel myself there, a nine-year-old running into the melee and rejoicing in the wonder of it all. That good enough for me.",654

Ashley Giles , the director of England cricket, announced on Thursday that a pool of players is being prepared for the possible resumption of international cricket in July and from Wednesday the bowlers will start working with coaches in one-on-one sessions, before the batsmen enter the nets two weeks later. and Stop the Tour: English cricket last summer of chaos | Vic Marks The Guardian understands that a strict “one skin per ball” policy will be in place for these sessions, where players will turn up in full kit at one of county grounds (at staggered times so as not to overlap) and undergo temperature checks, before working on cricket skills with a coach and under the supervision of a physio. The issue of using saliva and sweat to polish the ball during a global pandemic is still under discussion at the International Cricket Council as regards playing conditions; for now, players who train will be limited to an individual box of balls that only they can touch and must remain in their kit bag when not in use. This individual practice will be performed outdoors while maintaining a two-metre distance from the coach, with only the physio required to don PPE – sourced and paid for by the England and Wales Cricket Board – in the event of an injury that needs treatment. Coaches, some of whom will be drawn from the county circuit and paid for by England, will have their own set of balls for throwdowns or use of the bowling machine, while they must wear a rubber glove on their spare hand when taking deliveries from bowlers with a mitt on the other. Under government‑approved protocols drawn up by England medical team, batsmen have been told they must kick or hit the ball back to the coach in the nets, rather than pick it up and throw it as they might do normally. England face soaring costs to get West Indies series started Fielding drills will have the player balls used, rather than those allocated to the coach, while wicketkeeping gloves, mitts and the “side-arm” slingers used to replicate seam bowlers must all be disinfected between sessions. Players have been told to travel by car, bring their own clearly marked water bottles, regularly sanitise hands and make a swift departure afterwards before showering at home. There will be no storage of equipment on site and no dressing-room access. Giles said: “We should be able to get control of the environment so it safer to go back to practise than it is to go to the supermarket. I’m not making light of this but there are risks every time you go outside the house. We need to mitigate as many of the risks as we possibly can. “At one venue guys may train individually but with the same coach – a single coach for four or five bowlers [for example]. But with social distancing they shouldn’t be close enough to pass anything on. It essential we stick to these guidelines.” These stringent measures make up the first of three phases in the return of elite sport under biosecure conditions. The goal is that a squad of players convenes at Hampshire Ageas Bowl at the end of June before an intra-squad match and the first Test against West Indies on July. Old Trafford, which also has an on-site hotel, is the second ground expected to be used this summer but spectators will be absent. They face up to nine weeks operating in this manner and regular testing for But with the Test captain, Joe Root, expecting baby No in July, and mental welfare another consideration, Giles confirmed they are still looking at possible ways to get players in and out of the environment safely. Giles is yet to learn of any players reluctant to return – he confirmed they can opt out without prejudice – but declined to expand on the availability of Jack Leach, whose management of Crohn disease with immunosuppressant medication potentially places him in a high-risk category. “Right now I am confident,” Giles replied when asked if he believes international cricket will be staged in the UK this season. “Who knows what the UK – or the world – will look like in two months’ or three months’ time? “We hope we don’t take another dip, which would put all of us back. [But] If we continue on this trajectory hopefully we will have the right conditions to play some Test cricket.” A separate white-ball squad will begin training at a later date for the possible ODIs against Ireland at the end of July, while an update on the return to training for the first-class counties is expected before the end of the month. England centrally contracted women are also expected to begin practising from late June, even though their summer series against India and South Africa remain in doubt given the high costs of creating biosecure grounds.",864

The residential community is located between Fort Lauderdale and Miami. 'Bro, I'm risking my life': Rays' Snell says playing for reduced pay not worth it Baker, and Dunbar, were attending a cookout at a Miramar home Wednesday night when a fight broke out, and Baker pulled out a handgun, the warrant said.

Police said the four men then fled the home in three vehicles: a Mercedes Benz, a Lamborghini and a BMW. Witnesses said the vehicles were parked in a way that would make it easy to leave quickly, leading detectives to believe the robbery was planned. No injuries were reported.

10,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/review-recommends-change-in-attitude-to-restore-trust-in-premiership-clubs,"England leading clubs have been warned that a fundamental change in attitude is needed to restore public trust in the wake of the Saracens salary cap affair . An independent review undertaken by Lord Myners also makes a raft of significant recommendations, including stripping titles from clubs found guilty of cheating their way to silverware. Premiership players want answers over wage cuts before training return Myners comprehensive report takes an axe to large chunks of Premiership Rugby existing salary cap regulations and makes clear that attempts to cherry pick from the recommended improvements would further undermine faith in the competition and those administering it. Among the suggestions is that clubs could, in future, be suspended, stripped of their titles and forced to return any prize money, that marquee player exemptions should be abolished and that players be required to produce their tax returns or bank statements if any breach of regulations is suspected. The PRL board has also been urged to become more accountable and more transparent in how it communicates and to grant its salary cap director extended investigatory powers. It is also proposed to introduce a fit and proper test for club owners and to require them to sign a copy of the regulations to indicate their intention to abide by them, with potential lifetime bans for serial offenders. Random mini-audits of clubs’ books would also be introduced, with all co-investments with players banned and player loans to other clubs more strictly policed. Perhaps most striking of all is the report conclusion, which suggests that an insidious culture of rule-bending and legal nit-picking has become de rigeur in top-level English club administration, dating back to the decision in to brush under the carpet previous serious salary cap breaches involving Saracens and another Premiership club, widely reported to be Bath. “It is important that my recommendations should be viewed as a package of measures which, if taken together, will go a long way to restoring the integrity of the regulations,” Lord Myners wrote. “They should not be viewed as a menu of options from which to pick and choose. “If any club or other participant in professional club rugby seeks to use the legal definition of certain terminology to get around the clear intentions of these recommendations then they have entirely missed the point of this exercise and failed to learn the lesson of this painful episode. For PRL to fall short of those commitments in the pursuit of narrower interests would be detrimental to its reputation and consequently to its ability to trade at the highest commercial level possible.” The report reveals that “fiasco” and “shambles” frequently cropped up in feedback from the individuals and organisations who contributed to the review and that it was “overwhelmingly clear … that trust has been damaged”. Even the decision to deduct Saracens a total of points to ensure relegation to the Championship in addition to a fine of was technically flawed as it involved fellow clubs acting as judge and jury rather than independent justice being seen to be served.

11,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/renault-daniel-ricciardo-carlos-sainz-mclaren-f1,"Ferrari have confirmed Carlos Sainz will replace Sebastian Vettel in while McLaren announced Renault Daniel Ricciardo is to take over the seat vacated by Sainz. Sainz signing to partner Charles Leclerc at Ferrari ends speculation that Lewis Hamilton might join the Scuderia and means the world champion will almost certainly remain with Mercedes. Sebastian Vettel will leave Ferrari having failed to bring back glory days | Giles Richards Ferrari announced Vettel departure on Tuesday and with both teams eager to have their driver lineups stabilised the new deals were concluded by on Thursday morning. The Sainz has been given a two-year contract, while McLaren deal with Ricciardo is referred to as a multi-year agreement. “I am very happy that I will be driving for Scuderia Ferrari in and I’m excited about my future with the team,” Sainz said. The Spanish driver enjoyed the best season of his career at McLaren last year. He finished sixth in the championship, including a podium in Brazil, helping McLaren to achieve their best result since fourth in the constructors’ championship. With Leclerc only the two drivers are the youngest pairing at Ferrari for years. Sainz will be expected to play a support role to Leclerc, who Ferrari are now firmly backing as their No driver, but both will have a role in what the team see as a long-term process. They have opted for adaptable young drivers in anticipation of how the sport will change with a budget cap to be imposed next year and new regulations in “Carlos has proved to be very talented and has shown that he has the technical ability and the right attributes to make him an ideal fit with our family,” said the Ferrari team principal, Mattia Binotto. “We’ve embarked on a new cycle with the aim of getting back to the top in Formula One. It will be a long journey, not without its difficulties, especially given the current financial and regulatory situation.” McLaren were in negotiations with Sainz to extend his contract but the Spaniard was never going to turn down a chance to drive for Ferrari. He has forged a strong, friendly partnership with his current teammate, Lando Norris, a relationship Ferrari will doubtless want him to replicate with Leclerc. McLaren also moved quickly to ensure Ricciardo place. The team are known to like and respect the Australian who had been in negotiation with them to join before he opted for Renault in Ricciardo made his debut in In he was promoted to Red Bull and won seven grands prix with the team over five years but chose to leave when he felt marginalised by the arrival of Max Verstappen. Motor racing all-female W Series 'robust enough' to ride out storm “I am so grateful for my time with Renault and the way I was accepted into the team,” Ricciardo tweeted. “But we aren’t done and I can’t wait to get back on the grid this year. My next chapter isn’t here yet, so let finish this one strong. Merci.” As a works team, Renault ambition had been to join the fight at the front but last season Ricciardo was ninth in the championship and known to be frustrated. With McLaren taking Mercedes engines in he clearly believes they are more likely to bridge the gap to the leaders. The team principal, Andreas Seidl, believes that Ricciardo age and experience would sit well beside the Norris. “Daniel is a proven race-winner and his experience, commitment and energy will be a valuable addition to McLaren and our mission to return to the front of the field,” he said. Ricciardo departure is a blow for Renault. The team had placed great import on paying for a top driver but have failed to hang on to their star asset. Renault now have an open seat alongside Esteban Ocon for next year. Fernando Alonso, who won both his world championships with the team, has already been linked with them, as has Vettel. Neither would come cheap, nor would they be forgiving of the team failing to make the moves up the grid they have targeted.",686
12,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/15/joe-fraser-gymnasts-push-through-hard-times,"There are few live sporting experiences as transformative as gymnastics in all its glory. Aside from the spectacle of the exponents twisting their compact, muscular bodies in the air, it is the sound that is most startling, the noise created by bones and muscle and momentum meeting gravity as gymnasts collide with the ground. The brisk realisation of all the horrors possible if he or she is “off” by only a millimetre. The internet is filled with endless compilations of gymnasts crashing to the floor, but one of the most interesting offerings is from a gymnast himself. Joe Fraser videos , titled the Unseen Struggle , depict a normal day for him in the gym, which it turns out is just an unending series of falls. It is a sobering reminder that those pristine final routines on the biggest stages are a product of hundreds of failures and that chasing perfection is dangerous and exhausting. Gymnast Kyla Ross: 'Getting the news, being told you're done is the hardest' “It something that I felt I’ve struggled with over the years but I’m lucky I have training partners that see the direction of where the routines are going,” he says . “We have an eight-week preparation for competitions. There always been one week, between age until now, that I would cry. I would always cry for a whole week. I would feel like I wasn’t getting anywhere, and then the week after that things would come together. That kind of what gymnastics is. You have to push yourself for the hard times to get to the good times.” Fraser points out that all gymnasts learn from a young age how to fall safely, but injuries are always looming. One of the most difficult periods of his career occurred in as he prepared for the Commonwealth Games. A shoulder injury had stunted preparation for the trials and so he was rushing, working even harder, fighting against time. After one dismount from the high barhe landed half off the mat and an ankle rolled, dislocating under his weight. “I had to have surgery. I got back within three months of the injury, which was unheard of. I was told it would take me up to six. Knowing when I wanted to get back, I pushed myself in rehab. I kind of had something in my head that said: ‘OK, Joe, you can’t use your ankle but let make sure your real strength can improve.’ That the way I saw the injury and tried to motivate myself further,” he says. The setback proved to be an essential part of his growth as he matured into his gymnastics in and surprised the world by finishing eighth in the all-around final before winning a gold medal on parallel bars at the world championships. At Fraser became the third and youngest British gymnastics world champion. As he stood dazed before his BBC interviewer afterwards, he was shocked by the revelation that he was GB first black male gold medallist in the sport. “It means so much, knowing the kind of impact that a lot of gymnasts have had,” he says, smiling on the video link. “The likes of Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, John Orozco. The kind of influence they’ve had on me, even now. Knowing that I’m one of those people now and [that] a lot of black gymnasts look up to me would be amazing.” Fraser success naturally means that he attracts more attention now, but perhaps the greatest measure of his potential is how uninterested he is in constantly reliving the past. “For me, I don’t want to get sucked into the ‘I’m the world champion’. I want to be chasing, I want to be hungry and trying to improve that routine, improve my overall apparatus to be the best gymnast that I can. I don’t want to plateau. I want to keep pushing myself.” The time to push himself will soon come again, but not yet. He was speaking at home in Edgbaston and as a figurehead of the new #PresentForPounds challenge , a fundraising campaign launched by British Gymnastics for NHS Charities Together. As his training is restricted by the coronavirus crisis, Fraser has been creative and patient, even practising ring exercises hanging from a tree in the park. Although his motivation has occasionally wavered, he is driven because of what is still to come. When he was a child he once shaved the Olympic rings into his trim during a summer holiday as he dreamed of what his future could be. Today those big dreams have evolved into simple goals.",767
13,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/1970-and-stop-the-tour-english-crickets-last-summer-of-chaos,"rom a purely cricketing perspective the summer of was probably anticipated more eagerly than the season, whereupon there was turmoil and a cancellation of the Test tour that left a great chunk of the cricketing community in despair. The disruption then seems like a pinprick compared with today situation, but the bitterness engendered in was on a monumental scale. The best side in the world were due to tour England; the problem was the best side were South Africa. Like today, the situation required government intervention, but the virus in question was of a different kind in the apartheid regime in South Africa. In cricket eagerly awaits permission from Westminster to start playing again; years ago it was a Labour government that eventually made it impossible for the planned schedule of the summer cricket to go ahead. Peter Hain: ‘Stopping South Africa rugby and cricket teams hit them right in the gut’ Eighteen months earlier, England tour to South Africa had in effect been cancelled by the apartheid country prime minister, Dr John Vorster, the final act in a compelling melodrama we know as the D’Oliveira affair. Basil D’Oliveira had been the unwitting protagonist and just about the only person to come out of the controversy with his reputation intact. In the MCC and its selection panel had contrived to enrage the liberals in England and the diehard supporters of apartheid in South Africa within the space of a few weeks, a remarkable double. Now it was the turn of South Africa, who had recently thrashed Australia, to visit England. The cricketing establishment was desperate the tour should go ahead – those were the days when the MCC was reckoned to be far to the right of the Tory party – but beyond the tight‑knit cricketing community ruled from within the portals of Lord there was massive opposition to the tour. This was led by such eminent men as the Reverend David Sheppard, Lord Learie Constantine and Father Trevor Huddleston. From a different generation the Peter Hain organised the Stop the Tour Campaign with remarkable potency. The government was none too keen on the idea of the tour, either. In a television interview the prime minister, Harold Wilson, considered the MCC had made “a big mistake” in inviting the South Africa team – “a very ill-judged decision”. He said, with the proviso that any protests should not be violent: “Everyone should feel free to demonstrate against apartheid – I hope people will feel free to do so.” The bosses at Test grounds began investing in large quantities of barbed wire. The situation was so grave it became the subject of an emergency debate in the House of Commons. Finally, on May, less than two weeks before the tour was to start, the home secretary, Jim Callaghan, requested it should be cancelled “on the grounds of broad public policy”. This amounted to a government directive, so the Cricket Council had little choice but to agree, albeit reluctantly. Within a week the Test and County Cricket Board had arranged matches between England and a Rest of the World side. And what a side they were. The team contained five South Africans, in the Pollock brothers, Barry Richards, Mike Procter and Eddie Barlow; it was led by Gary Sobers and decorated by the talents of Rohan Kanhai, Clive Lloyd and Intikhab Alam, who were ever-presents in the side. Guinness put up a handsome silver trophy and sponsorship to the tune of and Edward Guinness CVO, today a remarkably active was on hand at the Oval after the final game to present the trophy to Sobers, whose team, unsurprisingly, had won the series The first match began at Lord on the eve of the general election and England, who were led by Ray Illingworth, lost it by an innings and runs thanks to Sobers, who took six for in the first innings of the matchthen cracked before taking two more wickets in the second innings. At the time the England players were awarded caps, although the Test status of these matches was later rescinded, which dented the CV of one player especially. Alan Jones, a silky left-handed opener for Glamorgan for a quarter of a century, played at Lord and was never selected again. He was such a gentle soul there was hardly a murmur of complaint from him but the decision seemed to anger his Welsh fans far more. England won the second match at Trent Bridge by eight wickets with Kent Brian Luckhurst, who forged a handy Test career after his performances in the series, hitting an unbeaten century in the second innings. Tony Greig, in his first match for England, and D’Oliveira shared wickets. The next three matches were all hard-fought and all ended in narrow victories for Sobers team at Edgbaston, Headingley and the Oval. There were some surprises along the way. Eddie Barlow, the irrepressible South African opening batsman, topped the bowling averages for the Rest of the World, taking wickets at apiece with his bustling, ever-optimistic medium-pacers; Greig did the same for England. Illingworth tally of runs at an average of was second only to that of Sobers runs), which must have helped him retain the England captaincy for the winter Ashes tour; Peter Lever seven for in the final match earned him a place on that trip. After four Tests most of the overseas players had sparkled somewhere – except the great South Africaleft-hander Graeme Pollock. But at the Oval he enchanted the crowd, hitting a glorious century and sharing a partnership with Sobers. Wisden editor, rarely given to hyperbole, described this as a “feast of batsmanship”. The season had been saved by the swift reaction to the cancellation of South Africa tour, some generous sponsorship and the eagerness of the best players in the world to seize the opportunity to display their talents. All that barbed wire could be sold on at a bargain rate to farmers or prison governors. It won’t be so easy this time around.",1002
14,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/15/spelling-bee-scripps-eligibility-eighth-grade,"Ding. When the bell rang after I misspelled tettigoniid , I was heartbroken. After grueling rounds of spelling, broadcast nationally in prime time, one letter vanquished me. The eight remaining contestants were crowned co-champions . I was declared runner-up. My mom asked if I wanted to train another full year until the next bee. I said yes. I wanted to try one last time. Now, my resolve to win has been replaced by profound disappointment. has changed everyone lives. Health concerns and tragedies are headlines. Kids attend school remotely. Until recently, I was, like other eighth-grade spellers, at home studying constantly, preparing for my final chance at the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Scripps ended that dream when it cancelled Bee and denied eighth-graders an extension of eligibility. How to build a spelling bee champion My spelling journey has been rewarding, but it wasn’t finished. Like highly-trained athletes we admire, I work tirelessly at my craft. I don’t hit a ball or run fast, but I spend hours daily working on language patterns and etymology – anything that could be a clue on how words are spelled. My training schedule resembled most athletes’. I got up at every day to study and stayed up past sometimes, learning innumerable words and roots. I trained on holidays and weekends. I skipped parties. I sacrificed most of my recreational time. Many other eighth-grade spellers did these things, too. We love spelling and poured our effort into one more shot at victory. Spelling has given me confidence, knowledge and a soupçon of celebrity. I’m not the most popular girl at school. But during last year finals, people from across the country tweeted about me! After the Bee concluded last year, people I didn’t know would recognize me in public. When I passed little kids at school, they would exclaim, “Look! It Simone!” It was wonderful. I was an example for them. In the future, some of them might participate in the Bee. Eighth-grade spellers like me show younger kids that persistence pays off. Scripps’ decision was devastating. I had expected that even if the Bee was cancelled, eligibility would be extended, as with Olympic and NCAA athletes. The International Olympic Committee and NCAA decided that since cancelled athletes’ events due to no fault of the athletes’, they should be given another chance to compete. Shouldn’t eighth-graders have the same chance to train, compete, and demonstrate that academic pursuits are as important as athletics? Or are we being taught that athletics will always trump other, less popular activities, even in the age of Scott Remer, Simone coach As Simone routine illustrates, serious spellers invest hundreds of hours into preparing. Spellers are “word detectives” – they analyze a word etymology and definition; assemble and evaluate possible spellings; and decide their spelling. In our weekly sessions, I quiz Simone on words I’ve selected to test her pattern recognition and root knowledge. When she makes a mistake, we examine it to understand what happened and what she can learn. Once the Bee stings you, there no going back. It a heady combination – the thrill of competition, camaraderie with fellow logophiles, and the frisson from piecing together an etymological puzzle. The night I placed fourth in was among the happiest of my life to date. It would be unjust to deny spellers like Simone the chance to claim the trophy because of a crisis for which she bears no responsibility. Scripps doesn’t have to deny Simone and other eighth-graders one last shot. They could grant a one-time exception for eighth-graders to compete as ninth-graders. They could hold two bees next year – one for kids who qualified in and another for Or they could hold a bee exclusively for eighth-graders and a bee as usual for spellers. Scripps has changed the Bee before – the RSVBee invitational program for spellers in areas without local competitions is one example of innovation to the contest format. There will be logistical complexities – Scripps mentioned a “complex mix of logistical factors” in an explanation of their decision. But Simone and I believe Scripps has the organizing chops and love of the Bee to overcome those hurdles. If you’d like to add your voice to the group of people asking Scripps to extend eighth-graders’ eligibility, please sign the petition here .

Its glamorous excesses aside, one boring race and the pitchforks come out. A dull Wimbledon final or Champions League climax doesn’t render tennis or football as a whole a pointless parade but is always up against it. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari departure could shake up drivers' market As a fan in the century, I am always told it was better in someone else day and that isn’t what it used to be, but changed that. The season opened with an unprecedented seven different race winners and upstarts Sergio Pérez and Romain Grosjean challenging the status quo with their maiden bows on the podium. As the season settled it became clear this was a two-horse race. The mercurial and romantic Fernando Alonso versus the mechanical and relentless Sebastian Vettel . Both were double champions, Alonso with Renault in and and Vettel with the supreme Red Bull conquering the previous two seasons, yet no one expected Alonso to be anywhere near the German. The Ferrari had been a shambles of a car but his remarkable ability to dig deeper than anyone else meant he was trailing Vettel only by points heading into the finale in Brazil. Vettel started three places higher on the grid but clouds were hovering in the Brazilian sky and there was a lingering sense this grand prix would not be a procession. The lights went out and seconds later Vettel was rolling backwards downhill at turn four. His critics argued that Vettel could not overtake. Sitting staring at exhausts this was the moment to prove them wrong. Alonso may have leapt to a championship-winning position but this mammoth race had plenty of twists and turns left. Mark Webber and Felipe Massa were obtrusive to their respective teammate rival, and such as Kamui Kobayashi were torpedoing through, without a drive the following year and with nothing to lose. Sebastian Vettel will leave Ferrari having failed to bring back glory days | Giles Richards Amid all this mid-grid scrapping, there was a race to be won. The McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button were tussling up front, with Nico Hülkenburg (Force India) lighting up the track behind. As the heavens opened and closed on a whim for the next hour, an eager Hülkenburg misjudged the wet surface while overtaking for the lead and Hamilton became a bumper cushion. The Briton final race for McLaren would end with him parked up against the barriers, no doubt wondering whether Mercedes would bring him the successes that were vanishing at McLaren. Button finished first but that was the lesser story of the day. A bruised Vettel spent the race carving through the field and contributing healthily to the record overtakes made. Alonso could only do so much; second was his ceiling. A compliant Michael Schumacher, ending his second spell in mediocrity, made no efforts to stop Vettel leapfrogging him for a vital sixth place – a symbolic gesture of one legendary German passing the baton to another. A late safety car ensured there would be no more stings in the tail and both teams knew it. The Red Bull pitwall were fidgety, waiting for the confirmation in two laps’ time, while the Ferrari garage was disconsolate and silent. Alonso stood by his car in the rain, gazing vacantly and awaiting a meagre podium celebration, knowing full well this was his best chance of a third title. Here was a man who had not put a foot wrong all year, only twice missing out on the points at the hands of a careering Grosjean. The following season would replicate the same order but a point gap told a starker story. When the nostalgics pine for the times of Hunt and Lauda, or Senna and Prost, it would be abhorrent if duel is not hankered after in the same way.",644
17,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/12/womens-cricket-has-too-many-interested-parties-and-is-too-big-to-fail,"f frost arrives unexpectedly or cruelly, tender, young plants wither and die. Hardier ones are more likely to see it out, with only a browned leaf as a war wound, raring to sprout after a prudent prune. Timing, as ever, is everything. And so to women cricket, frosted by in the sharpest way. With two international series for England, against India and South Africa, a new Hundred competition complete with joint marketing alongside the men franchises (if much less exposure on TV) and player contracts worth up to this summer was expected to be a vital one. Charlotte Edwards fears delay to the Hundred will damage women cricket But even more than the men game, it now looks washed out. Kaput. Last week the England and Wales Cricket Board managing director of women cricket, Clare Connor, admitted there may be no international women cricket this summer. With a limited number of biosecure venues (Old Trafford and Southampton, with possibly one other in the mix), the ECB has decided that pragmatism wins – it will make the more lucrative men game the priority. Not only that, but women cricket seems to have lost control of the of funding promised for the next two years by the ECB last October. The ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, testifying to the digital, culture, media and sport subcommittee last week, confirmed the money would no longer be ringfenced: the family silver has been pulled out of the cupboard and shown to the pawnbroker, everything is now on the table. Connor will be “devastated” if there is no women international cricket this summer; as will the young players at grassroots level who fell in love with the game during the and World Cups, the professionals whose years at the top are so fragile and short, those who had gambled financially on Hundred contracts, and those in the middle who were hopeful of getting one of the professional contracts designed to help bridge the gap between professional and amateur women cricket and stop them drifting off to other careers. Those contracts, promised for early summer, are now delayed, with talk in the air of a much reduced retainer instead. All the female county players have been invited to a Zoom call with Connor on Thursday; it cannot come soon enough for many. The left-arm spinner Alex Hartley, who lost her England central contract in January, has spoken out about a lack of clarity. “My big issue with this is that everything I’m reading in the papers and on Twitter and the internet is the first I’ve ever heard of anything,” she told the Wisden Podcast. “From my point of view, losing my England contract and then being told: ‘You can still be a professional cricketer from April, and then there the Hundred, you’ll earn a decent wage’ – now it May and I haven’t heard a single thing. I’m jobless, I’ve got no income, no car, I’ve got a mortgage. It getting to the point where I’m going to have to get a job.” She is not alone. As one up-and-coming young county player put it: “The thought of no cricket this year is actually quite upsetting as I want to keep pushing myself to get in as far as I can. This year for women domestic cricket was so important as it all changes next season with the regional teams. Doing well this year would help me get a professional contract, which is my ultimate aim. I do understand the prioritising of men cricket but the women game is on the rise so it gutting that it would be set aside.” However, for all the undoubtedly awful personal stories of disappointment and financial strain, and intense frustration of a nascent game held back, is it OK to be thankful in a broad-brush way that, for the sake of women cricket, this crisis did not happen five years ago? That the coronavirus black hole the ECB is looking at may mean the men game temporarily takes priority but it categorically will not mean the women game disappears. For all their past brush-offs, the paring back of the county system and the delays to the setting up of the centres of excellence, the ECB has made a public commitment to the women game, even during the crisis. “Nothing about dilutes our vision for the game in this country and that is for a gender-balanced game,” Harrison said this month. “There is no question about our ongoing ambition for women cricket; we will do what is in our power to protect it.” So thank you to the World Cup and that game-changing final at Lord, thank you to the Women Big Bash, to the Kia Super League (God rest its soul), to Ellyse Perry and her many wondrous talents, to Harmanpreet Kaur not out , to Sarah Taylor swift hands, to the people who turned up to the MCG for the women World Cup final just a few weeks before lockdown began. Though it is no consolation for those whose contracts have now disappeared, women cricket is now too big to fail. It has too much potential for growth, too many interested parties, too many sponsors (Toyota, McDonald, Bunnings, Harvey Norman and Adidas for the World Cup), too many influential voices, and is too important for potential funding streams, too politically sensitive. Its green shoots are tougher than they look, it will find a way to spring back when the soil is a little warmer, the season more welcoming. But we all need to check that when that time comes, the head gardener has not been distracted. This is an extract from the Guardian weekly cricket email, The Spin.

On May the championship held its first race at Silverstone and the British Grand Prix has been on the Formula One calendar ever since, its longevity reflecting how the sport has moved royalty and commoner alike. Not long put to new use from its original purpose as a second world war airfield, Silverstone and were intent on making their mark. Run by the Royal Automobile Club the race was named the “Grand Prix d’Europe, incorporating the British Grand Prix”. With King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret in attendance some dubbed it “Royal Silverstone” in the hope it would become part of the sporting season. Sebastian Vettel will leave Ferrari having failed to bring back glory days | Giles Richards It remains the only time the reigning monarch has attended a British motor race and rare documents held in the archive of the British Racing Drivers’ Club housed in the marvellous new Silverstone museum describe the extraordinary level of planning that went into the event, right down to the royal lap time. “It is hoped,” pre-race notes reveal, “that their majesties will drive round the track at approximately miles an hour.” The race programme speaks eloquently of a different era when explaining the sport to newcomers. “Smoking Permitted: Grand Prix drivers do not have to undergo strict physical training,” it reads. “Moderation in eating, drinking and smoking is sufficient, for motor racing is a test of brain rather than brawn.” With fans in attendance, most of whom had paid (the equivalent of for general entry, the race was ready to go and with the cars three and four abreast on the grid they took off. “The noise and the smoke took the Queen a trifle unawares as the mass start of a race does to those close to the course,” the report in Motorsport read. “Princess Margaret seemed to want to concentrate solely on what was happening and to regard conversation as merely incidental.” The race lasted for almost two and a quarter hours over laps and was dominated by the “Alfetta” Alfa Romeo that ruled the era, winning of the races in which they were entered between and Alfa, whose cars had been driven to Silverstone illegally on public roads from Banbury, had a formidable lineup in Giuseppe Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli, with the Briton Reg Parnell as their fourth driver. The rest of field were largely Maseratis, including one driven by Thai royalty in Prince Bira, and supercharged Talbot-Lagos. Ferrari were notable by their absence, the only team ever present in since were still preparing their cars for the next round at Monaco. Farina led from the off and Parnell car was quickly recognisable from the smashed radiator grill incurred when a hare ventured into its path. Fangio battled with Farina for the lead until he damaged an oil pipe and retired but Alfa secured a with Farina, Fagioli and Parnell. The Talbot of Yves Giraud-Cabantous was more than two laps back in fourth. Alfa were in complete control that season winning every race bar the Indy a timely reminder a single dominant team is not new to the sport. Farina would go on to take the inaugural drivers’ championship from Fangio. It had been a day to remember for local boy John King, who recalled events for Silverstone museum oral history project in King had stumbled across the racing by accident. “We didn’t know anything about grand prix cars,” he recalled. “I was going home, we heard this noise and when I got through the hedge that was Copse Corner and there was a car parked up on the inside. They’d stopped going round so I shot across and it happened to be a blue Talbot Lago. That was the first racing car I’d ever seen.” King returned on raceday. He vividly remembers the sight of the cars gathered on the start line. “You’ve never seen anything like it in all your life. The atmosphere was fantastic. People had come with their old vans and built a platform up on top. It was marvellous, like a great big club atmosphere.” The huge crowd had made the event but brought the associated difficulties familiar to fans years later. A correspondent to Motorsport complained the toilets were “nothing short of disgusting” and the magazine criticised the traffic congestion that would blight Silverstone until recent years. however, could not have wished for a better start. It had touched a chord and while a monarch never made it back, for others it started a lifelong love affair. King joined the Silverstone Racing Club and attended grands prix until his death in",803
20,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/13/english-youth-rugby-obsession-size-stunts-progress,"ast week we highlighted the problem of England wasted rugby youth and wondered if the topic might chime with a few people. The ensuing days have been revealing and hugely instructive: messages have cascaded in from former internationals, from schoolboy coaches and from concerned parents alike, many raising more stark questions for those in charge of developing young players. No one disputes there are good coaches or is suggesting the academies and the Rugby Football Union get everything wrong. Consider, however, the testimony of Mike Umaga, whose son Jacob is among the brightest young English playmaking talents. Mike younger brother, Tana, captained the All Blacks, while the elder sibling won caps for Samoa, played professional league and union and has been coaching in England for two decades. And his verdict? Even some of the best English youngsters are succeeding in spite of the system rather than as a product of it. Lost youth: RFU face questions with up to of academy talent at risk | Robert Kitson Specifically, Umaga thinks English rugby has a problem with size. Ask him if the English “pathway” is tricky to negotiate, even for the gifted, and he speaks from the heart. “Tricky is a bit of an understatement. It was tough for Jacob and ourselves as parents,” says the former Halifax league and Rotherham union player whose son switched from Leicester academy to Wasps in “Jacob was always deemed to be too small. At both Leicester and Wasps they said: ‘He needs to be bigger,’ and tried to put some unnecessary weight on him.” Umaga polite response was that, given his genes, Jacob would probably turn out fine, not least because his July birthday put him at a disadvantage. “I’d say to coaches: ‘You can always add some poundage but the body needs to grow naturally as well. If myself and his uncle are anything to go by, he will grow.’” It was depressing, therefore, when England age-group coaches began to say the same. “Before he went to the World Cup he was put on a bulking programme. I was dismayed when he left because he wasn’t in any shape to perform at an elite tournament. He was overweight and hadn’t done a lot of conditioning. It was all about putting size on.” Having grown up in New Zealand, where skill and speed are prioritised and there is less performance pressure on younger kids, Umaga knew there was another way. “There no substitute for skill and pace. Why not have those first and then you can manufacture the muscle? Jacob is only just starting to fill out now, aged Everyone different. It not an exact science but some coaches try to make it one. There are so many factors you need to take into account.” Among them, he believes, is a lack of trust between certain academies, schools and, crucially, parents. Umaga and others believe the latter are often marginalised. “At times it about having the nuts – for want of a better word – to go and say: ‘Can you clarify this? We need to know how we can work towards making things better.’” A further handicap, says Umaga, is the English tendency to ramp up pressure too young. “The start of their academy journey is What the point in that? That what a lot of people I speak to are saying. They are so far down in terms of their growth and there is so much rugby still to go.” Too much early pressure can mean less enjoyment and, unlike in New Zealand where the school system dominates, English kids are beholden to various different masters. “It one of the big issues over here. At or a lot of these boys might have four or five different teams to play for – school or college, academy, club, county and, if they’re lucky, country,” says Umaga. “On top of all that they’ve still got their education to get through. That a lot of stress at I don’t think there is enough trust or liaison between some of these academies and the schools.” Many of these laments are echoed at lower levels. Rob Sigley, like Umaga, gives daily thanks for rugby positive influence on his family. In Sigley case it offered salvation from the relentless bullying he suffered during his formative years in Tamworth. As a comprehensive pupil he also had frequent experience of county players who owed their selection to the better facilities and enhanced opportunities available at nearby private schools. After being involved in the game at all levels as a player, coach, parent and agent, Sigley has a keen nose for such injustice. In particular, he tells of an assistant academy manager at a Premiership club who, at a trial, ignored all the smaller, skilful players and instead picked the biggest lads for the next stage of the developing player programme. The explanation given – “I can make big lads into rugby players, but I can’t make good players bigger” – infuriates Sigley even now. “For me he is the antichrist of rugby and everything that is wrong. It a good job Damian McKenzie didn’t grow up where I live.” Clubs demand input in shaping international rugby calendar Sigley, in an attempt to redress the balance, is hoping to launch the Second Chance Rugby Academy in January to help rejected teenagers. The aim is to offer a shop window for youngsters released by Premiership clubs and, perhaps, help them to secure school or university scholarship funding. Encouragingly, there have been supportive murmurings from within the RFU reshuffled age-group coaching structure. Whatever unfolds, Umaga hopes his son, Caylen, who is already showing promise, will have a smoother path than Jacob. “Your original article has raised a lot of debate and conversation among a lot of coaches in the country. I don’t know if some people in academy setups are protecting their jobs but sometimes it feels as if it more about them than the kids.” His final summary should also be pinned to a few English walls. “It because they’ve got the population that they can get away with it. It covers over the cracks, doesn’t it? Why wouldn’t you look at the NZ model? Their resources are so much smaller yet they still churn out quality.” Even in these barren times this fundamental debate looks set to run and run.",1059
21,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/12/kareem-abdul-jabbar-covid-19-donald-trump,"here a moment near the end of most sports movies when the coach gives a heartfelt pep talk right before the crucial game. The coach will use words like “heart,” “honor,” and “teamwork”. Everything that happens on the court or field after that is a bit of a letdown because victory – whether on the scoreboard or of the spirit – seems inevitable after the speech. To movie audiences, these moments may seem corny, but in real life, when someone you admire and respect speaks, their words can have a great impact. I certainly listened when coaches I respected, such as John Wooden , spoke at crucial points during my career. Inspiring people to be their best is what great coaches – and great politicians – do. It one of the qualities that makes them great. For the past few months, this country has faced a formidable opponent in It been kicking our butts across every state and the statistics are only getting worse. America has a deep bench of expertise and we know how to come together as a team when we need to. Yet, faced with uncomfortable truths and frightening inconsistencies in leadership, we’ve started to unravel here and there. Rather than pull together in a crisis, we’re fighting each other . And that leading to even more deaths. One thing we could use right now is a passionate rallying speech from our president that inspires us all to do the right thing, not just for ourselves, but for our country. It is the speech Trump should deliver, not because he wants to be reelected, but because it would address the country major concerns, end the political squabbling, provide a reasonable plan going forward, and give Americans confidence that their government is working to protect their health and economic concerns. It needs to be the speech of a statesman not a, well, Trump. If I were Trump speechwriter, using the lessons I learned from great talks I heard in my basketball career, this is what I would give him to deliver: The way Americans regard sports heroes versus intellectuals speaks volumes | Kareem Abdul-Jabbar “America has faced many enemies before, both foreign and domestic. The goal of those enemies has always been to destroy not just America itself, but the ideal America stands for, which is equal treatment and opportunity for all who live here, regardless of wealth, ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. is an enemy that doesn’t care about politics or social justice – it an opportunistic organism that just wants to feed and spread. It doesn’t want to destroy America. But if we’re not careful, it might achieve that anyway. “People are defined by how they act, not during the good times when kindness and compassion are easy, but during the tough times, when helping a neighbor could cost us. A crisis reveals whether we are heroes are villains. Ernest Hemingway said, ‘Courage is grace under pressure,’ and I believe that Americans are ready to demonstrate their courage through grace. “That has to start with those of us in government who are entrusted with the task of fighting this enemy. The only way we can justify the people trust is by being completely transparent in our mistakes, successes, and plans for the future. “We have made mistakes. My administration did not act quickly enough in recognizing the serious threat that posed. We should have, but we didn’t. No excuse is offered because no excuse is acceptable. That delay led to a domino effect of playing catch-up in developing enough testing and in getting necessary medical supplies to health care facilities. But we have learned from our mistakes and those of other countries as well. “The virus has worsened already unacceptable racial and economic disparity in this country. The death rate among the black and Latinx communities is significantly higher than among white communities . I will do everything in my power to change that. The virus is also attacking our democratic process , threatening to keep people of color and those economically challenged from being able to cast their votes in November. I will do everything in my power to ensure every eligible voter voice will be counted. “As for those out there who use our national crisis as an excuse to marginalize others or do harm to others because of their race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity, not only do I not support you, I will do everything in my power to see you are prosecuted. Because the whole point of the president power is to use it to protect those who need it most. And if that offends you, then don’t vote for me. “As of right now, my administration is fully committed to one mission: keeping our people physically healthy while also protecting the country economic health. Balancing those two crucial, yet sometimes competing goals is the greatest challenge this country has faced in decades. No one has definitive answers because this situation is unique. However, it is our pledge to never put lives at risk just for the sake of unnecessary economic policies. Any decision regarding opening businesses or reducing shelter-in-place will be data-driven, based only on the information gathered by the country leading scientific and medical experts, not partisan appointments. “ No one knows definitively how the virus originated . But investigating the source is crucial to further understanding how it works and spreads and may help us to battle other viruses in the future. Countries need to work together to gather this information, not to place blame or levy accusations or seek reparations, but rather to help humanity survive. Toward that end, I pledge no actions will be sought against any country involved. “To ensure that my focus remains on this task, I will not participate in any campaigning for the presidency. I will continue to run for the office, but I will let my actions alone be my campaign. How I conduct myself as your leader over these next few months is my campaign. “I will make no campaign speeches, I will not talk disparagingly of my opponent or his surrogates. There will be no activity regarding the border wall or other divisive issues. We all need to work together to overcome this threat in the here and now, without one eye perpetually on November. President Lincoln said , “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” That is even more appropriate now, years later, as we face an increasing death toll and a declining economy. America is fighting for its survival – not just as a country, but as an ideal. And nothing is more important than proving to ourselves and the rest of the world that our shared ideals are powerful enough to overcome any enemy, seen or unseen.” That is the speech of a president determined to lead us during our darkest days and uncertain future. It requires abandoning all notions of ratings and personal aggrandizement to just focus on the welfare of the people in their moment of deepest need. It requires someone who loves the country more than their career. It requires greatness.",1191
22,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/england-face-soaring-costs-to-get-west-indies-series-started,"England face a mounting bill to ensure the Test series against West Indies takes place in July, with the need to charter private flights for the tourists and cover the cost of up to additional squad players. As the recipient of all broadcast revenues the home board for an international series would, in normal times, pay for the away team travel and accommodation up to a set number of people – roughly players and support staff – as well as providing tour fees and individual daily expenses allowances. This time West Indies need a squad of players for what is planned to be seven weeks in the UK, including four weeks of quarantine and training before the first Test on July. England players set to make return to training as hope grows for Tests Johnny Grave, the West Indies chief executive, told Sky Sports they will draw on players from seven or eight islands and it is likely chartered planes will be needed to assemble them before the final departure, again via private plane. These journeys are estimated to cost The breakdown of the bill makes up part of the negotiations between the two boards but, along with the additional cost of creating biosecure conditions , it appears a price worth paying for the England and Wales Cricket Board given each Test is estimated to be worth in broadcast revenue. Like England, West Indies intend to give their players the option to miss the series if they are not comfortable with the provisions, with Grave outlining how the decision is viewed from across the Atlantic. “Just in terms of sheer numbers of deaths in the UK, over people is an enormous number,” he said. “Here in the Caribbean, for people who are based here and have lived most of their lives on the smaller islands, you are talking about of the total populations. It is a very different mindset here in terms of going to what is seen as one of the eyes of the storm of this virus.”",339
23,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/13/jos-buttler-apprehensive-about-return-to-cricket-training-for-england-test-matches,"Jos Buttler admits he will feel some “apprehension and anxiety” when the England men team return to training, and that he is yet to decide how comfortable he is with playing during the crisis. England are expected to resume training in pairs or with designated coaches by the end of next week, with hopes building that a three-Test series against West Indies will be playable behind closed doors in July. Buttler is happy to pick up a bat again but expects a mixture of emotions as he and his teammates enter the unknown. ECB poised to publish guidelines on recreational practice for cricket clubs “I actually had some natural apprehension and anxiety,” Buttler said of the moment he read a return could be imminent. “There natural performance anxiety that you haven’t felt for seven weeks, you’ve had some freedom from that. Lots of different feelings: how will it look and what will my cricket look like? Because we’re not going back to cricket as we know it, and it all very new, it very much step by step at the moment. People can only give you week-by-week assurances so that makes it very difficult to plan. “You have natural apprehension and I think it’ll take me a few days to work out those feelings and work out the process of how I can control that. If we progress to playing cricket behind closed doors it’ll be important to have coping strategies for the different scenarios we’re going to come up against.” Asked whether there were any red lines he would not cross in the event cricket restarted, Buttler said: “Over the next few days I’ll probably come up with: ‘What does it look like for me? Is there anything where I would say X, Y or Z would mean I don’t feel comfortable playing and trying to perform to my best? Is it the right thing to do?’” He emphasised that players do not feel pushed into restarting and that, similarly to when England toured Bangladesh in amid significant safety concerns, all individual stances would be respected. “It been made clear that the safety of the players is going to be paramount to any cricket being played, and if you don’t feel comfortable that is your own decision. Similarly to when you’re injured, if someone comes in and performs fantastically well it is going to affect you, but it fair to say if someone had reservations about playing then in these times it wouldn’t be held against you.” Footballers such as Raheem Sterling and Danny Rose have expressed doubts about their sport resuming. Buttler pointed out cricket is easier to play while physically distanced, but he accepted there will be worries about how a number of basic actions can be performed. “There lots of questions. [Such as] everyone having to touch the ball, and shining the ball, which is one of the biggest bits of cricket at times. Especially in England, you want it to swing.” The England and Wales Cricket Board is depending on a summer Test schedule to help address a potential loss and Buttler admitted concerns about the longer-term picture. “Naturally you do worry about what it could look like after. The state of the game in England was in a great place and going from strength to strength last summer. Hopefully, as sport has the power to do a lot of the time, we can bring people together and bounce back.”",575

The government recovery strategy permits exercise “with up to one person from outside your household” from Wednesday and now the England and Wales Cricket Board is seeking to establish what this means for all levels of the sport during talks with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport this week. England cricketers may want warm-up matches but they do not need them | Vic Marks The hope for the centrally-contracted men is that, with sporting events deemed to have a chance to resume in empty stadia from June under step two of the strategy, and the ECB lining up six Tests against West Indies and Pakistan from July, they can begin having one-on-one net sessions outdoors, provided a two-metre distance is still observed by the participants. It would see players paired up with a local teammate or coach - either from the ECB or a county coach on secondment – and though merely baby steps towards a return to training in larger groups, it would offer some cricket-based work after weeks of strength and conditioning work at home . An ECB spokesperson said: “[We] will monitor government guidance and continue planning accordingly. If and when appropriate, we will announce our return to training protocols, which will incorporate the implementation of core training principles for our elite players.” The ECB is continuing to work on the medical and logistical requirements for playing international fixtures in “biosecure” conditions and Ricky Skerritt, the president of Cricket West Indies, has shared his belief that a near full-strength side will travel given the assurances being sought. Skerritt told in Trinidad: “We don’t have any benefit to gain by sending a weakened team. If the majority of our decision-makers are in agreement with what the ECB is proposing, then one or two players decide that this is too onerous for them, that is their prerogative, we are not going to force anyone [to travel]. “Fortunately, we do not expect that because I do not see any reason for anybody to say [the players] will be less safe in the UK than they will be at home under the circumstances.” The Pakistan Cricket Board is making more cautious noises about their side proposed visit in August in advance of a conference call with the ECB on Friday. But Wasim Khan, the PCB chief executive, has stressed that he will not be using the situation to push for England to end a absence from touring Pakistan on security grounds. Khan told reporters in Lahore: “It a tough situation for everyone right now, and I don’t think it fair to take advantage of the situation. The most important thing for us is to revive the game for all countries. If we don’t, we will be facing a lot of problems going forward.”",495

Even after years I knew instantly what it was because it had been stuck to my bedroom wall when I was a teenager: indeed the old brown shadows of the tape were still there. It was the ticket for my first day Test cricket: the fifth Test against Australia at the Oval on August Derek Underwood match and the game that started a lifelong obsession. We joined my friend Matthew and his mother – two teenagers, what were we thinking of, taking our mothers? – and caught an early train from deepest Berkshire. London was a big, strange place where we rarely ventured and never as far south as We were square to the wicket and the players were so distant as to be indistinct, almost lost against the crowd. The England batting for the Test was almost prelapsarian: Edrich, Milburn, Dexter, Cowdrey and Graveney. D’Oliveira, Knott and the bowling – Snow and Brown, Underwood and Illingworth – was full of experience. Australia had won the one match to finish, at Old Trafford weeks earlier, and had since retained the Ashes, but England had been robbed by rain twice. What we wanted was to see England bat and build a big score, preferably by the beefy Colin Milburn and Lord Ted Dexter, or the stylish Tom Graveney. What we got was John Edrich, the stocky left-handed opener who no one could accuse of being dashing, holding the batting together all through the long, hot day. Not long before the end Graveney was out and Basil D’Oliveira came in: for four was not a great return for five hours’ batting in perfect conditions. We knew all about Dolly, a late selection, and that he might be picked for the South Africa tour that winter, but we didn’t realise quite how important the innings was to him, if he was to impress the selectors, nor how determined he was to do so. He announced himself with three crashing drives down the ground: bang, bang, bang. And that was the day: for four. We got home, sunburnt and exhausted at nearly midnight. Basil D’Oliveira not in was a bodged job that changed history | Matthew Engel D’Oliveira carried on the next day as if his career depended on it, reaching Edrich was finally out for and England ended on from which they could boss the match. Over the weekend England whittled down the Australians, with the dogged opener Bill Lawry fulfilling the Edrich role. When he had made he nudged behind to Alan Knott, ostentatiously rubbing his shirt when the bowler John Snow appealed. When Arthur Fagg gave him out, Lawry was seen to speak to him. “How was I out, umpire?” “LBW,” Fagg replied phlegmatically. “I couldn’t have been – I hit it.” On a sunny fifth morning England closed in on victory: set to win, Australia were for five. Suddenly, at lunch, a thunderstorm flooded the Oval, ankle deep. It took only a few minutes before the sun came out, but I remember despairing: we had be robbed again. Then the crowd materialised on the outfield helping the groundstaff to sweep away the water and finally the ground was fit for play. There were minutes left: could England take five wickets on a pitch like a pudding? For minutes, they couldn’t. At home I could not sit still: the opener John Inverarity and the wicketkeeper Barry Jarman held out. Then Cowdrey called up D’Oliveira and he bowled Jarman. The Underwood, with his medium-paced, left-arm spin, became Deadly Derek on a drying pitch. Two were out in an over; another minutes then John Gleeson was bowled. Six minutes left: a straight one, Inverarity legs stuck in the muddy crease, LBW. Underwood had four wickets in balls for six runs. England won by runs with six minutes remaining. It was the school holidays so I followed the play continuously on television and radio. John Arlott commentary was concise, lyrical and graphic, even to a “And McKenzie sweeps that, in the general direction of Batterrseeea …” It was enough: I was hooked.",694
27,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/07/cricket-joe-root-england-ready-for-isolation-to-save-tests-west-indies-pakistan,"Joe Root says England are ready to go into isolation to save this summer Test series against the West Indies and Pakistan. That could mean the Test captain also missing the birth of his second child but he is ready to make that sacrifice for a return to live international cricket. With sport tentatively discussing a way back, England cricketers learned this week that a squad of up to players could be chosen for a run of six Tests at the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford from July. “I’m optimistic about it‚” Root told Sky Sports. “It would be a real shame if doesn’t happen. The public are desperate for some live sport and the guys are missing it.” Root is concerned about safety for all those involved and is aware of the abnormal conditions that may apply. “The players would be sectioned off in one part of the hotel and would be in isolation together. There would be no interaction with the media, the TV crews or even the opposition when off the pitch. We would have separate lunchrooms. It would have a different feel to it but it probably manageable. Hopefully that is the case.” England cricketers may want warm-up matches but they do not need them | Vic Marks If both West Indies and Pakistan were prepared to buy into this scheme England players could be locked together for as long as nine weeks. Root, like one or two others in a likely squad who could extend to players, is expecting a second child and would like to be at the birth but he acknowledges it would not be straightforward “to move in and out of the bubble”. There is no guarantee that West Indies will accept the proposals, given how the UK is the country most afflicted by in Europe. “We have just tried to present the likely environment to see if it a possibility for them‚” Root said. Root believes that the cricket should not be subjected to any unusual restrictions because of the pandemic: a wicketkeeper standing up and a crowded slip cordon, say, would have to be permitted. “If the game itself is to be compromised, then we shouldn’t be going ahead,” he said. The overriding impression is that the England players are keen on playing and this was also reflected by Mark Wood. Being locked away for two months in hotels in Southampton and Manchester overlooking a cricket ground may not be the ultimate sacrifice but Wood said: “It would be very hard but as long as the environment is safe, my family are safe and everybody else there is safe then I’d be willing to do it. “Being away on tour for long periods you get used to it. I think everybody would be willing to come back and play some cricket. We’re desperate to get going.” Wood has maintained his fitness levels. “I’ve got a bike in the house, I’ve been doing some running and I have weights in the garage. I’ve been trying to tick over and to strengthen the area in my side – I hope the time off has helped that – and then it a little bit of buildup back into bowling. “ I’m not saying I’m a Jimmy Anderson, who gets into his groove nice and easy and seems just to be at the top of his game like a magician. He seems to just rock up and hits the top of off stump.” Wood wants to resume being the “smiling assassin”, a tag encouraged by England coach, Chris Silverwood. He would certainly not expect to play every game. A rotation policy for the pacemen, so often discussed, would be implemented. Undoubtedly his effervescent personality would be invaluable in what may become a two-month lockdown for England players. “All the communication [with the ECB via Ashley Giles and their chief medical officer, Nick Pierce] has been really good,” Wood said. “I don’t feel like I’m under any pressure to play and I don’t get that feeling from the others.” However as Root noted: “There are so many moving parts in all this.” As far as the West Indies series is concerned these include nine governments, one in the UK and eight in the Caribbean, who may have more important agendas to pursue.",717
28,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/07/my-favourite-game-derbyshire-v-northants-1981-natwest-trophy-final-cricket,"ot every childhood highlight stands the test of time. Were Curly Wurlys really that good? Or Toffos? Or Puffa Puffa Rice? It prompts a faint sense of apprehension as I start to search for my most sacred piece of sporting footage, from Saturday September And breathe: as well as being awash with glorious distant summer sepia, it retains an emotional resonance like nothing before or since. The context may need a little explaining. Despite living more than three hours’ drive away, only one cricket team really mattered. Derbyshire CCC had won nothing since Not only that, there were few more downtrodden underdogs in any team game in Britain. Even now, people unfairly refer to something being “about as much fun as a wet day in Derby”. My favourite game: Middlesex v Kent, final It was, admittedly, the case that Derbyshire routinely finished bottom of the County Championship in the But tree-ringed Chesterfield was high among the country most scenic grounds, Bob Taylor had an irresistible pair of blue wicketkeeping gloves and my pet rabbit was named after Geoff “Dusty” Miller. It had a lucky escape, given Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan also made the shortlist. Now, finally, there was a chance of validation, both for the Peak District finest and my perverse obsession. Courtesy of a madcap last-ball win in the semi-final against Essex, “Derbs” had somehow made it to a sun-baked Lord for the NatWest Trophy final. Could they do it? With Derbyshire, it seldom paid to be too optimistic. Soon enough Northants were without loss on a flat, dry pitch, only for a swiping Wayne Larkins to pick out a sun-hatted Miller in front of the Mound Stand. When Allan Lamb was narrowly run out by a direct hit from Miller and a diving Alan Hill pulled off an improbable catch in the deep to remove Richard Williams, the contest was wonderfully poised. Geoff Cook went on to make a fine but, from for two, Northants were pegged back to a moderate for nine from overs. Derbyshire, in reply, began slowly. John Wright autobiography, Christmas in Raratonga, is an uproarious read for connoisseurs of well-told Derbyshire anecdotes but the Kiwi was rather less flamboyant here. The good news was that the dapper Peter Kirsten was at the other end: shirt unbuttoned, chest glistening, the scoreboard ticking over nicely at for one. Until both went in quick succession to ratchet up the tension significantly. Unlike rugby or football, there is more time in cricket to fear the worst. Miller swung a juicy full toss from Sarfraz Nawaz for a relieving six but Northants gamely clung on. Everything, in the end, hinged on the game final delivery: Jim Griffiths to Colin Tunnicliffe with one run needed to tie and earn Derbyshire victory by virtue of losing fewer wickets. From the boundary rope, it felt as if my whole life was on hold. Sport-obsessed, rural upbringings can do that to you. Up ran Griffiths and bowled to Tunnicliffe. Did it hit his pad or had he got an inside edge? No matter. Miller hurtled up the pitch from the non-striker end and, simultaneously, hundreds of us rushed on to the field with no idea of the outcome. Had he made it? Incredibly, a couple of Derbyshire sun-hats were flying in the air. Eureka! If you check out the dopey-looking youth jumping around in front of the Lord pavilion at the bottom of the screen, you can still see what teenage nirvana looks like. In that instant, too, it was clear Superman had a beard and wielded a Gray Nicholls. As the BBC Peter West put it: “And there Miller, diving for the crease as if he was scoring a rugby try!” Watching it back is to rejoice afresh at the split second when every single planet in the solar system was miraculously aligned. Almost years later I can still recite every word of Barry Wood gap-toothed post-match interview – “Total elation for me but I can’t help feeling sorry for Geoff [Cook] here” – and West twilight sign-off – “And that our first moon shot at Lord” – after the highlights. One small footnote in cricket history, maybe, but a giant leap for some of us.",702
29,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/07/england-players-can-contest-six-summer-tests-with-minimum-of-preparations,"he England and Wales Cricket Board is planning to play six Test matches this summer against the West Indies and Pakistan behind closed doors from the second week of July onwards. In a grim situation this may represent the height of optimism; it would be a bonus for the armchair fans and the TV companies, even if every banal word of encouragement from behind the stumps would be echoing eerily around an empty stadium. These plans may come to nothing but if none are made there definitely will not be any international cricket this summer. It seems the right thing to do and Steve Elworthy, a logistical expert in overseeing tournaments, is hard at work. England cricketers face biosecure tests in nine-week break from families The detail of what is required is beyond my pay grade, but the medics, the technicians, the broadcasters, the hoteliers, the groundstaff and the maintenance staff will be brainstorming to create an environment that is bio secure (a word, now commonplace, that does not exist in my dictionary). But what of the players? Assuming they are reassured that playing cricket again does not risk their health, will they be in a fit state to perform in a Test match? Without wishing to enhance any reputation as a curmudgeon the answer is: “Do me a favour. Of course they will.” It was suggested a month ago by the director of cricket, Ashley Giles, that England players would need four weeks to be ready for a Test. Well, they may want four weeks, but they don’t need it. If the West Indies series really can begin on July both sides will struggle to prepare but it would be wildly inappropriate for them to complain. The level of the players’ fitness and form would be a pinprick compared to other considerations and in any case “the same for both sides” mantra applies. We are in extreme circumstances. Did Wally Hammond and Lindsay Hassett insist upon a delay to the start of the Victory Test series in to allow both sides to complete their physical and mental preparations? I don’t think so. The crowds flocked to those matches as a visible sign of national relief and an expression of hope that life was returning to normal. That will not be possible in and there is no victory to celebrate, but there is an appetite for some live sport even if all the seats at the grounds (presumably Old Trafford and the Ageas Bowl) are empty. With safeguards satisfied and permission granted, the players are obliged to put on a show but the matches will be hard-pressed to emulate the joyous, fraternal contests between England and the Australian Services of years ago (bear in mind Don Bradman was in Australia at the time). In fact the idea that the only way to prepare for an international is by playing several matches beforehand is now outmoded. Admittedly Sir Geoffrey Boycott has always been keen to point out the imperative of playing proper cricket before any Test, and before him Fred Trueman would not take much prompting to point out that he bowled first-class overs every season. Playing cricket probably is the best way to prepare for an international match, but this has rarely been the way over the past couple of decades. Modern players are not spooked by a lack of match practice. Prince among these is surely England white-ball captain, Eoin Morgan of Middlesex – notionally. In he played two Championship matches for his county, which was two more than he managed in and Morgan is a national treasure after last summer World Cup triumph but one should also admire how he has cracked the system. He has proven that it is possible to flourish playing the odd game around the globe – his latest non-international venture was for the Delhi Bulls in the Super League in Abu Dhabi – in between captaining England. He still manages to deliver at regular intervals as a batsman on the international stage. That is neat. Before the virus took hold two more unlikely characters demonstrated how it was possible to excel after being pitchforked into a Test without playing beforehand. Mark Wood played no Championship cricket for Durham last summer when he only appeared in ODI cricket for England until the World Cup final. Yet when selected for two Test matches in South Africa in January he prospered, such was the diligence and determination of his preparations. Dom Bess did not have to deal with the constant threat of injury like Wood yet when he suddenly appeared in South Africa, a novice in Test cricket, he had not played a match since the previous September. Yet he also performed remarkably well. It is easier for bowlers to survive without match practice. They can enhance their fitness and tune the appropriate muscles by bowling in the nets or on the square, which can be a solitary, lonely pursuit. With dedication and a carefully planned routine it is clearly possible to prepare effectively for a Test match in this way. Wood keeps proving that. It is even possible to do so and keep within the physical-distancing guidelines. It is tougher for batsmen; it is more difficult for them to ease back into form in the middle of a Test. One mistake and they can be back in the pavilion. More than bowlers they need the rhythm of batting in a match. The magic touch has to return. But let not be too precious about this. The logistical challenge of playing a Test in the time of coronavirus is a massive undertaking; by comparison remembering how to bat, bowl and field is a doddle.",948

England women were due to face India across June and July, but that series has been postponed with a view to staging it later in the summer. South Africa are scheduled to visit in September for a white-ball series but there is a risk neither set of fixtures will happen. England cricketers face biosecure tests in nine-week break from families The ECB accepts the far more lucrative men game may be prioritised if any top-level matches are to take place in the coming months, with the sport future potentially at stake if they are cancelled. “We have to be completely realistic,” Clare Connor, the ECB managing director of women cricket, said. “If the international women schedule can’t be fulfilled in full but a large amount of the men programme can this summer, which is going to reduce that hole, we have to be realistic about that. “We’ve got long-term ambitions for the game that extend beyond this summer, and trying to protect as much investment as possible over the next five years. That is largely going to come down to how much international men cricket can be staged this summer. That not to say we won’t be fighting hard to play against India and South Africa as best we can.” Women cricket finds itself at the back of a queue to use what are – if the ECB plan to get the sport moving this summer comes off – understood to be two biosecure venues , the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford, maintained for Tests. Connor admitted there were “only a certain number of days to try and cram everything into” and that Lisa Keightley players may have to stay sidelined for the greater good. “I would be devastated if there was no international women cricket this summer,” she said. “No one would be more disappointed, but we’ve got this period to get through and we’ve all got to come out of it as healthy as possible. If we have to play less international women cricket this summer to safeguard the longer-term future, investment and building the infrastructure for a more stable and sustainable women game then that is probably a hit we might have to take.” Asked what message an absence of international women cricket would send, Connor said: “It would be disappointing. We have to communicate really well and honestly about what we are doing and why. I don’t think you can argue with the rationale and, in order for the whole game to survive, the financial necessity rests on many of these international men matches being fulfilled.” The Spin | A bittersweet time travel back to Edgbaston why not? The stakes are particularly high given the ECB launched its action plan to transform women and girls’ cricket last October. “If the worst-case scenario financial loss becomes a reality then there are obviously going to be big swaths of the game that can’t continue or be developed as we would have liked,” she said. “I think the advantage we have is that the action plan is a living plan – it is launched. We started to build the infrastructure around that.” Connor added that discussions are under way about how to help players who may have expected to sign a professional contract in the new domestic women structure on May.",581

Joe Root side had their first briefing on Tuesday about the biosecurity measures due to be in place this summer, and learned that a squad of up to could be chosen for a run of six Tests at the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford from July. Cricket will lose if season is wiped out, warns ECB chief executive While the plan is still fraught with hurdles and subject to guidelines for all sports being approved by central government, there is a growing belief at the England and Wales Cricket Board that the two grounds, with their on-site hotels, could mitigate to an acceptable level the risk of playing behind closed doors. It would require a huge commitment from the players, who would be asked to assemble at the Ageas Bowl on June and may have to then stay together until the proposed third Test against Pakistan at the end of August. After initial testing, they would spend the first week training in small groups before an inter-squad match that serves as a warm-up for the first Test against West Indies. The enlarged squad of around players for both teams would facilitate this, with the tourists playing their practice match either on one of the two pitches at the Ageas Bowl or a nearby club ground. It will also give England scope to rotate their players during a gruelling run of six Tests in just over seven weeks – not least the fast bowlers, who will need their workloads managed – but a good number could spend this extended spell away from loved ones without actually winning a cap. If infection rates drop nationally there is a chance the players might be permitted to return home for a few days before the first Test against Pakistan – pencilled in for August – but this may still require relatives to isolate for a spell before their arrival. England are also hopeful of playing their one-day international series against Ireland during this brief window at the end of July, although any movement between the two squads is also likely to be subject to some form of quarantine beforehand. Preventing physical contact in the camp is unrealistic given the sport dynamics but the squad will still be expected to observe the physical-distancing instructions in place during their aborted tour of Sri Lanka in March, where handshakes were replaced by fist bumps and hygiene measures were strengthened. As well as this there will be daily temperature checks to screen for symptoms and testing every few days, while physical contact with the outside world will be almost entirely cut off. Life in the so-called “bubble” has been described as a scaled-up version of the PMOA, the restricted area at international matches that are policed to prevent would-be corrupters gaining access. To this end it is understood that the skeleton staff who work at the two grounds and their adjoining hotels will operate in small groups; should one staff member go down, colleagues who are in the same sub-team would also be taken out of circulation and placed under quarantine. Overall it is a huge undertaking – one that looks unlikely to be replicated for domestic cricket – and remains delicately poised.

With Premier League clubs also facing a potential TV shortfall if the football season does not resume this summer, the financial damage to sport from is likely to run into billions. That, however, is only the tip of the iceberg with UK Sport also confirming that six unnamed Olympic and Paralympic sports are facing a threat to their solvency within the next three months because they are unable to host events and membership fees and sponsorship have dried up. EFL chief says parachute payments are 'an evil that must be eradicated' Such is the severity of the problem – first revealed by the Guardian last month – that the chair of UK Sport, Dame Katherine Grainger, has asked the government for in exceptional funding “within weeks” to ease the financial uncertainty for Great Britain athletes and sports as they prepare for the postponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, now to be held in But as the digital, culture, media and sport select committee was told, all sports are facing crippling costs owing to being unable to hold matches in front of spectators. Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB, warned that English cricket could lose as much as if there is no play this summer. “We are still working on impact of across the entire game, but we anticipate the cost of no cricket this year could be as bad as across all of our professional clubs and the ECB,” Harrison told MPs. “That is the worst-case scenario.” There will be no professional cricket in England until at least July and the Hundred, the governing body flagship new competition, has been postponed until . Harrison said he still hoped some international cricket would take place behind closed doors “with a following wind”, including England matches against West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and Ireland. However, he conceded: “We staring at a loss this year whatever happens. We are going to have to take a good look at our cost base … and cut our cloth accordingly. We have less money coming into the sport. It is the most significant financial challenge we have ever faced.” The chairman of the English Football League, Rick Parry, painted a similarly bleak picture when he spoke to MPs, telling them the lower league clubs were facing a black hole by September. Parry said it was impossible to predict how many clubs could go under but was adamant English football would have to undergo huge changes, including a salary cap for players, to sustain itself in the years ahead. “In the Championship wages are of turnover,” he said. “That is ridiculous and it is definitely not sustainable now or in the future. One benefit of going through this pain is that we will be shocked into a more sustainable model.” Player wages and contracts will bankrupt EFL clubs: it time for the PFA to act | Mark Palios Parry warned of a “very messy” legal battle if the Premier League tried to deny promotion to the three clubs from the Championship – adding that “lawyers are going to get very wealthy if that happens”. Bill Sweeney, the chief executive of the RFU, said his organisation could lose in the next year if England autumn internationals and the Six Nations Championship were cancelled. That figure would be reduced to if games against New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Australia at Twickenham in November were played without fans. But Sweeney warned the RFU may end up needing a government bailout. He said: “It is a very significant loss of revenue and we are doing what we can to mitigate it. If this was to be prolonged and go through into the next summer and the Six Nations games were impacted, then there would be a catastrophic impact on rugby union in England.” In evidence to the MPs the Sport England chief executive, Tim Hollingsworth, stressed the impact the pandemic was having on grassroots sport and activity. One fact from Hollingsworth particularly cut through: that of children are now doing no physical activity at all, or less than the minutes recommended by the chief medical officer since the crisis began. That is up from a third before the lockdown began.",740

Actually, who fancies three-and-a-bit days of Proustian rushes? From on Thursday, the BBC is replaying the full Test Match Special commentary of the second Ashes Test of It appears Sky Sports are also repeating the whole thing, though I can’t quite work out why the programme begins at on Thursday. Those five syllables – Edgbaston – have already sent me to several happy places and the re-listen hasn’t even started yet. This column isn’t long enough to tell the story of the whole game, and this needless sentence isn’t doing me any favours with the word count either, so let focus on the day life changed: August The exponential drama of the match, culminating in England heart-stopping two-run win on the Sunday morning, sometimes obscures a first day that should never cease to astonish. Wax to shine cricket balls the latest twist in extraordinary sporting times England were all out for their highest first-day total since the second world war. And that was from overs; the pro-rata total was in a day. England captain Michael Vaughan later said that “the manner in which we played on that first day was the turning point of the entire series”. You can probably see it now: Marcus Trescothick pinging a stream of the sweetest cover drives, Andrew Flintoff heaving sixes all over the gaff, Kevin Pietersen bringing up his with the dreamiest cuff past mid-on off Brett Lee . Even without Glenn McGrath, this was against a team with a aura and a four-man attack who had Test wickets between them. Where did England get the effrontery? It stemmed from a chat between two blokes in a deserted field on the edge of the Leeds outer ring road. In the break after the first Test, the coach Duncan Fletcher drove up to do some technical work with Vaughan at the New Rover cricket club in Adel. When they chatted between net sessions they kept coming back to how submissive the batsmen had been, Pietersen aside, in the defeat at Lord. They knew they had to tell the top six to be hyper-aggressive, however scary a prospect that might be, but Fletcher also stressed the need for “total conviction” in their delivery. They even discussed the tone of voice they would use. Although there was far more to Vaughan captaincy genius, at its heart was a simple message: attack, except in times of trouble, when you should attack even harder, because it by far your best chance of stealing momentum. My favourite game: Middlesex v Kent, final We know all about McGrath injury and the toss when Ricky Ponting made the errant decision to bowl first. “He didn’t rate the English batting and it cost him and us,” said Shane Warne in No Spin. The morning session went by in a blur of boundaries, and by lunch England were for one after overs. They got so far ahead of the game they were able to repel the inevitable Australia fightback and they also established an undeniable template for the rest of the series. “Marcus was worth vastly more than many big hundreds,” said Flintoff in his autobiography Second Innings. “It announced we had come to play.” Even without McGrath, Australia had Warne to apply control and he was on inside the first hour. Yet even he went at a run a ball for most of the day. While he was defending Warne first three deliveries, Strauss kept thinking back to Vaughan and Fletcher team talk. And so he boffed the next ball back over Warne head for four, a symbolic statement of his and England intent. Two overs later, Trescothick saw Strauss shot and raised it with the quiet fulfilment of a fantasy. During the previous summer, Warne suggested in his newspaper column that England should drop Trescothick. “I did something I had wanted to do ever since he told the world I had been found out as a Test player,” wrote Trescothick in Coming Back to Me. “I didn’t say a word; I just hit him back over his head for six. It was a completely sublime moment.” England ran with the mood for the rest of the day, with Flintoff exhilaratingly rustic including five sixes, coming from only balls. Like England, Flintoff had moments of fortune; he got off the mark with a mis-hit boundary off Warne that just cleared mid-off. Had that been caught, he would have had three runs in three innings in the series. Soon after he muscled Warne down the ground for six and then, in Warne next over, chipped him over midwicket. He was aiming for four but timed it so well it went into the crowd. “That was when I thought: ‘I’m in here,’” he wrote in Second Innings. “And things just started happening. It all came back.” Flintoff said he “bottled it” in the first Test at Lord. If he could have bottled how he played at Edgbaston – seven wickets, two mighty half-centuries, nine sixes, one legendary over – he would have been one of the greatest players in history. Thinking about Edgbaston triggers so many vivid memories: having a minor breakdown while writing the Guardian over-by-over coverage on that final morning, giddily hugging my colleague Sean Ingle when England took the final wicket, even going to see an outdoor screening of Donnie Darko in Kensington Gardens, London, the previous night. It evokes all those little details – irrelevant to anyone else, with meaning that is impossible to convey – that stimulate a kind of ephemeral, bittersweet time travel. I can remember so much about that long weekend: what was on my iPod , what I was wearing, where I drank, who I kissed. Most of all, I remember the desperate, dizzying and ultimately euphoric experience of watching the greatest Test match I will ever see.

Cruden, who joined Super Rugby Chiefs this year, was reportedly paid an annual by Montpellier, whose ambitions are funded by Altrad rather than the income generated by a club that have one of the lowest average attendances in the Top Not bad for someone who for most of his international career was second choice, first to Dan Carter and then to Beauden Barrett. Rugby Australia is on a final warning – drastic measures must be taken to ensure survival | Bret Harris The All Blacks are the biggest brand in the game and their players command a price that excitable French owners, who appear to do little research beyond where potential recruits come from, have been happy to pay. Toulon Mourad Boudjellal harvested New Zealand players when he owned the club, often lamenting that his purchases quickly depreciated in value after reaching France, with even Ma’a Nonu singled out for attack. Nonu was one of six backs who started the World Cup final against Australiawho went on to join a Top club. Julian Savea went to Toulon and was also singled out by Boudjellal. Nehe Milner-Skudder signed for Toulon in but never made an appearance because of a shoulder injury; there were suggestions his contract was not approved by the league. Conrad Smith went to Pau, Ben Smith destination after last year tournament in Japan. Carter was tempted to Paris by Racing offer of more than a year, and only Aaron Smith has stayed at home. Cruden time at Montpellier was blighted by injuries, as was Carter at Racing. Another All Black Lima Sopoaga, has struggled since joining Wasps in although he was in his best form for the club before the lockdown. A couple of months ago he talked about the difficulties of adjusting to life in a new country, saying: “We do not have our support networks here. There a whole bunch of things, but I make no excuses for my poor form over the last year or so.” There have been many examples of successful signings, not least Nick Evans at Harlequins who quickly adapted to the slower, more structured nature of the Premiership . When Gareth Anscombe arrived at Cardiff Blues from New Zealand, he took time to adjust to the wavelength of the team, at times making plays that would have been read by Super Rugby teammates but confounded his new colleagues. Boudjellal struggled to understand why a player who had been part of a World Cup-winning team could not make the same impact in the Top His most successful recruit from outside France was Jonny Wilkinson and he expected every other big-name signing to have as profound an influence as the fly-half he signed from Newcastle. Wilkinson was exceptional, sacrificing everything in his pursuit of excellence, and became fluent in French as he immersed himself in his new surroundings. The England World Cup winner was handsomely paid but was driven, as ever, by the desire to succeed and be the best he could, helping Toulon reach the summit in Europe . Which is why owners should do their homework. Simply expecting a player with a wealth of caps and a track record of success to fit in immediately, yielding an instant return on a substantial investment, is a folly that should be tempered by the current crisis that is stretching every professional club. High-profile signings, especially in France but on occasion in England, have been driven by owners rather than coaches, vehicles to sell season tickets and merchandise. Backs are more attractive in that regard than forwards, although the latter tend to offer more value for money. Carter was treated like royalty on his arrival in Paris and mobbed by crowds, but he admitted to being surprised by the more hands-on approaches of coaches in Europe, with less input sought from players than he was used to. The Breakdown | Bill Beaumont re-election risks global rift, but where would the south go? The Top is a grind, with matches before the play-offs and European games on top. Expensive imports are expected to play a full part. With these players used to being managed and rested when needed, is it a surprise that so many pick up injuries regularly? There is no urge to entertain as there is in the south, and many become absorbed in the largely unambitious nature of club rugby in Europe. It is a theme Eddie Jones tellingly touched on in the England head coach recently published autobiography. Were it not for the offers to more than double their salary, how many would give up their international careers for life in a foreign country? What was a superannuation package for players whose time at the top level was all but over has changed, with younger players such as Sopoaga and Charles Piutau tempted over in recent years. Does the lack of an international place to play for affect players who are inherently competitive? It is not just players who travel from the other side of the world whose footprint is hard to make out. The Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb left Toulon in a flurry of insults and the Lions No Taulupe Faletau has spent much of his time at Bath in the treatment room, like Liam Williams at Saracens and Leigh Halfpenny at Toulon. On the other hand, Finn Russell has settled at Racing while Luke McAlister had a successful six years at Toulouse. Kurtley Beale is joining Racing, along with Luke Jones, part of an expected Australian exodus given the financial problems there , while South Africa Super Rugby players have until Thursday to decide whether to accept a pay cut or move overseas.

36,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/13/premiership-players-to-ask-about-25-wage-cuts-before-training-return,"Premiership players are poised to seek clarification over whether their pay cuts will be stopped as well as what the testing procedures are before agreeing to return to training following approval from the government. The Premiership welcomed the DCMS guidelines which allow players to train individually, provided they are physically distanced, but the Rugby Football Union warned there is “significant work to do” before that can happen. A decision on precisely when players can return to their clubs is expected on Thursday following a meeting between both organisations and the Rugby Players’ Association. English youth rugby obsession with size stunts the progress of talent | Robert Kitson The guidelines also come with a host of conditions, including clubs conducting one-on-one discussions with players, who are required to “opt in” to returning to training. Wage cuts and concerns over testing – of which the guidelines made no mention – are expected to be raised. As revealed by the Guardian, the initial wage cuts across the Premiership in March were met with resistance by players, largely because clubs did not adopt a uniform approach. Some stated they would last until players came off the government furlough scheme while others were less clear as to whether it would be until they resumed training, or until the clubs started receiving income again. Players were given legal advice to reserve their position, with claims of unlawful deduction of wages likely, and if clubs are not willing to restore players to their full wages when they are expected to return to training, it could lead to further claims. While clubs are expected to seek clarification, players returning to training in any capacity is highly likely to mean they no longer qualify for the government furlough scheme. One well-placed source said: “The problem will be when the players start returning to training and start expecting to be on full wages. That when the clubs will look at deferrals and further cuts. Discussions will happen all over again once the furlough stops.” Even with the DCMS approval, the Premiership hopes of resuming the season by early July look to be dashed with the RFU seemingly insisting the move would need the union approval, making a swift return to training unlikely. The guidelines also make it clear that the government would have to give approval before contact training can begin and urge clubs to ensure they have the necessary insurance policies in place. An RFU statement read: “While much has been done in recent weeks to establish protocols around a safe return to training and ultimately competition, there is still significant work to do and discussions to be had with players and staff before any form of training can resume, their welfare will be at the heart of our decisions.” Meanwhile, Eddie Jones has called for a reduction in the number of replacements used in rugby from eight to six in what would constitute a radical law change to the game. The England head coach, who has repeatedly predicted the rise of more versatile “hybrid” players who can interchange between the forwards and backs, believes fewer replacements would lead to less emphasis on power. “With eight subs you can replace half your team in the second half, so you’ve got power [as a focus],” Jones told the Rugby Ruckus podcast. “All those things have built a game where it suiting the power players … We should cut down the subs to six, which would put a different aspect on the game. So imagine that you carried three front-rows, one lock who could play back-row, one half-back and then a back-line player that can cover from to That would certainly make it a more fatiguing game because you wouldn’t get that half a team being replaced.”",626
37,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/11/clubs-demand-input-in-shaping-international-calendar,"An escalating club versus country row intensified on Monday with Premiership Rugby demanding a say in any changes to the international calendar when the sport resumes in a letter sent to World Rugby and the Rugby Football Union. The Premiership chief executive, Darren Childs, and his French counterpart, Paul Goze, both signed the letter addressed to World Rugby, the RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney and the France federation president Bernard Laporte, insisting that it was “essential” that the domestic leagues were involved in shaping the post-pandemic landscape. Rugby Australia is on a final warning – drastic measures must be taken to ensure survival | Bret Harris World Rugby has a contingency plan to reschedule the July tours – certain to be cancelled – for October, which, along with this year postponed Six Nations match against Italy and their autumn fixtures, could see England play seven matches this autumn. The Premiership would hope its season is up and running by then however, while the Champions Cup organisers have also targeted October for completing this season competition. Eddie Jones is guaranteed access to his players for England match against Italy but it is believed there is no such provision under the RFU agreement with the Premiership for a rescheduled tour of Japan in October. The Premiership has previously insisted that any structural changes to the season would have to be put to the clubs via the Professional Game Board but Monday letter goes further and calls for a seat at the decision-making table. “It is essential that any possible changes of the competition periods devoted to the national teams can only take place after consultation and within the framework of an agreement with the professional leagues affected by such changes,” reads the letter. “The exceptional situation must lead all the parties to show a spirit of cooperation and solidarity, we do not however imagine that club competitions should be the variable for adjusting the calendar management in the context of this crisis.” Following re-election as World Rugby chairman earlier this month, Bill Beaumont pledged cooperation with the clubs as part of an aligned global calendar but the letter signed by Childs and Goze outlines how they have asked the game governing body to be part of the decision-making process several times and claimed their requests were not taken into account. World Rugby, meanwhile, says the RFU and the France federation have said they would prefer to deal with the leagues directly and insists the Premiership and Top will be consulted over moving the July tours to October. A statement read: “In the event that there is necessary reorganisation of the international calendar to mitigate the significant competition and financial impact of on national unions, any remodelling will be undertaken in full consultation with all stakeholders.” Itoje and Mako Vunipola will stay at Saracens, believes England coach Mitchell The Premiership clubs are waiting on guidelines from the DCMS before finalising plans to return to training after the government advised that sporting events can resume as of June. The Premiership best-scenario for restarting matches is late June – though July is more likely as players will need at least four weeks of full training before the league can begin. It is thought, however, that they will begin gradually in small groups depending on the DCMS protocols. Elsewhere, Andrea Pinchen has replaced Simon Cohen as Leicester chief executive. Cohen has left the post with immediate effect after years at the club with Pinchen, formerly chief operating officer, taking over. “[Andrea] brings huge passion, commitment and energy to the club and was the board unanimous choice,” said Leicester chairman Peter Tom. “We are sure she will be a great success in her new role and we wish her every success.”",624
38,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/12/rugby-australia-is-on-a-final-warning-drastic-measures-must-be-taken-to-ensure-survival,"ustralian rugby is facing an existential threat – and it is not just the coronavirus crisis that is causing the code to suffer. The shocking, if somewhat unsurprising, revelations in News Corp publications about the cataclysmic financial position must be the final warning to a code that is in danger of sinking into oblivion. According to the report s, Rugby Australia (RA) blew over the last four years and faces liabilities in excess of Those figures are believed to be accurate, though a bit dated, which means the situation could actually be worse. Australia-only Super Rugby competition to include axed Western Force How is RA to trade its way out of this financial black hole in the current economic crisis? All sports are struggling with the impact of the crisis, but rugby is suffering more than most, to the point where the very essence of the sport is under threat. It is time for Australian rugby to imagine the unimaginable – that the professional game in the country, with the possible exception of the Wallabies, will virtually cease to exist if something drastic is not done to rescue the code financially. Australian rugby cannot afford to be so complacent as to think it could not happen. Just look at basketball as a case study. In the National Basketball League predicted it would be the most popular sport in Australia by the year if it continued its pace of growth, but within a decade the game popularity deteriorated to the brink of collapse. In Australian rugby was so popular it threatened to challenge rugby league as the major sport in NSW and Queensland, but has now fallen way behind its major rivals, the NRL and AFL. The parallels between rugby and basketball are frightening. Both sports suffered a mass exodus of players to rich overseas clubs and experienced difficulties with their broadcast partners. The fractured relationship between RA and its long-time broadcast partner, Fox Sports, is key to the survival of professional rugby below Test level – and that essentially means Super Rugby or some other provincial competition. Relations between RA and Fox Sports broke down when the former RA chief executive Raelene Castle rejected the broadcaster initial offer of a year, down from the current as part of the renegotiation of the broadcast deal for to If there is no other bidder for the rights, such as Optus, RA interim CEO Rob Clarke will have to repair relations with Fox Sports, assuming the News Corp-owned pay-TV operator is still interested. It is difficult to see Fox Sports walking away from rugby completely because the demographics of the code followers help to drive subscriptions. But Fox Sports, of course, has its own financial troubles. There have been reports that it will only offer RA for the broadcast rights. This may be a bargaining tactic but if the figures are correct it will have dire consequences for Australian rugby. It could result in a mass exodus of leading players to Europe and Japan once play in the northern hemisphere resumes post the lockdown. In this scenario, RA would be forced to abandon the so-called Giteau Law and consider all overseas-based Australian players for the Wallabies, which would have a hugely detrimental effect on Super Rugby. RA would also have to seriously consider reducing the number of Australian Super Rugby teams from four to three, or perhaps only two, to remain competitive with New Zealand and South African opposition. That is assuming Australian teams will be involved in an international provincial competition in the future. While Australian rugby long-term future is uncertain, it is the here and now that urgently needs to be addressed. A prospective loan from World Rugby would only see RA through to the end of the year, bringing up the possibility of insolvency. RA desperately needs a resumption in play to generate revenue, but what will it be able to put on the field and what will it be worth to a broadcaster if indeed any broadcaster is interested? Without a Trans-Tasman bubble, RA is to organise a domestic Australian Super Rugby competition and invite the Western Force back into the fold to make up the numbers. If Fox Sports was only willing to pay for the rights to the whole Super Rugby competition, what would it be prepared to fork out for an Australian version lasting only three months? Anything less and an Australian domestic competition would not be commercially viable. RA, like the NRL appears set to do, needs to negotiate a long-term broadcast deal with Fox Sports which is front-loaded to survive the short-term but will also safeguard the long-term future of the game. Of course, that would require a fair amount of goodwill. The former Network Ten chief-executive Hamish McLennan is reportedly close to coming on to the RA board as chairman and his background in the News Corp culture would certainly help RA in its negotiations with Fox Sports. But what if Fox, as has been reported, has already walked away from rugby? What if there is no other bidder? RA would no doubt go into voluntary administration and Australian rugby would then be reduced to a community game with the Wallabies possibly the only remaining professional, or semi-professional, team in the country. That would be a serious threat to the code very existence.",890
39,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/11/australian-only-super-rugby-competition-to-include-axed-western-force,"An adapted version of Super Rugby will recommence with an Australian-only competition comprising five or six teams, including the Western Force, being planned to start in early July. RA has released a return-to-play strategy with the aim of starting a competition, with the Force and possibly Japan Sunwolves joining the four Australian Super Rugby teams. The original five-nation competition was suspended in mid-March because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic . “The draw we are looking at is a competition, weeks of regular round matches and depending on the number of teams, work out how many games per week there,” RA general manager of professional rugby services Ben Whitaker said. New Zealand reveals return to sport plans including 'Super Rugby Aotearoa' “The Sunwolves, at the moment would be located in either New South Wales or Queensland.” The Perth-based Force were considered surplus to requirements in when they were axed from the competition. They have since been playing in Global Rapid Rugby and the National Rugby Championship. Global travel restrictions have put paid to the inclusion of the South African cohort of teams, along with Argentina Jaguares, while New Zealand Rugby has already announced its plans for its own local-only competition. The four-nation Rugby Championship which is due to commence in August, wlll be pushed back, though Sanzaar officials are still hoping it will be staged. “The international travel restrictions in South Africa and Argentina have been strengthened in the last couple of weeks and you will see that both of those nations at least won’t have any restrictions lifted until September,” Whitaker said. Rugby Australia Return To Play committee has been meeting regularly to lay down plans for a new-look competition, while they have been absorbing knowledge from the NRL, which will resume later this month. RA is giving Super Rugby clubs a education briefing this week, with players set to resume training on May, giving them seven weeks ahead of a Friday July start. While the NRL will have less than three weeks of contact training, rugby believes its players – particularly tight forwards – need more lead-in time with the proposed dateline giving them a month. The Super Rugby season was suspended due to the outbreak in mid-March, after just seven rounds of play had been completed. New Zealand teams – the Blues, Chiefs, Hurricanes, Crusaders and Highlanders – will resume play on Saturday June, following Monday announcement by the government that the country will move to alert level two on Thursday. A set of protocols has been developed and will be endorsed by the government to allow play to restart at that level. The measures include daily symptom and temperature checks for players, team management and other officials involved in the competition, as well as stringent hygiene and cleaning, contact tracing practices, and asking anyone who feels unwell to stay away, self-isolate and get tested. NZR CEO Mark Robinson said: “The thought of five world-class Kiwi teams battling it out in matches over weeks should put a smile back on the faces of many people. I know our players are excited and I’m sure rugby fans will be as well.”",523
40,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/09/itoje-and-mako-vunipola-will-stay-at-saracens-believes-englands-mitchell,"Maro Itoje and Mako Vunipola have been urged to make “good decisions” for their international careers by the England defence coach, John Mitchell, with both players yet to commit to Saracens next season. Itoje had hoped to receive dispensation to continue his England career while spending next season on loan in France at Racing rather than in the Championship with relegated Saracens . However, that move was blocked by the other Premiership clubs since it did not meet “exceptional circumstances”, the loophole that allows England head coach, Eddie Jones, to select overseas-based players in the event of an injury crisis. Saracens players apologise after breaking lockdown for coffee meet-up Vunipola, meanwhile, has not yet confirmed his plans, though his brother Billy has said he will stay with Saracens, and, with the north London club recently introducing hefty wage deferrals for their top earners on top of the blanket Premiership wage cuts, a move away would appear all the more tempting, even if that would mean he was unavailable for England. “I’m sure Eddie, as he is very good at, is guiding them and helping them and they have probably sought his advice,” said Mitchell. “They’ve got family and friends and people within Saracens who they trust. I’m quite confident that they will make good decisions, that is right for them and their families and also that is right in terms of playing Test rugby for England because they are two guys who love playing for England.” Mitchell has acknowledged that rugby union will not be among the first sports to resume due to its physical nature. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, is set to announce the first steps towards an easing of the lockdown on Sunday, with a host of governing bodies eager to know what it will mean for their sports. The Premiership remains hopeful of returning in early July and, while England tour of Japan that month is certain to be called off, World Rugby has been plotting a raft of internationals for the autumn. “The RFU and our medics are working very closely with the government and it important I leave it with them,” the New Zealander added. “No one knows what the pecking order will be. I guess it just sensible that non-contact sports will be the creators of the start, I guess, and we’ll learn from what we experience and what they go through. When we eventually get the green button then we as a coaching group will need to be ready. “We’re going to have to be creative and innovative around how we do things. A lot of our players are going to be better for this as well because they’ve had to find a way to train with home constraints. We are going to have to find different ways to train based on the distancing.”",472
41,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/09/rugbys-return-may-be-hampered-by-premiership-players-insurance-cover,"Premiership players face having to sign disclaimers before returning to training due to fears clubs and their doctors will not have the necessary insurance policies in place to cover against coronavirus claims, a leading sports lawyer has warned. World Rugby has issued guidelines urging clubs and unions to ensure they are “adequately insured” but there is considerable doubt as to whether insurance companies would offer that level of indemnity before players return to their clubs. Saracens players apologise after breaking lockdown for coffee meet-up Richard Cramer of Front Row Legal believes there will also be serious concern among club doctors, who would want full insurance cover before players return – with the Premiership hopeful they can resume training on June. Without that level of protection, players could be required to sign waivers. “Clubs need to be very wary of exposing themselves to claims,” Cramer told the Observer. “Where I would be nervous if I was a club is just seeing what the insurance market is doing. As a club, I don’t think you can have any high degree of confidence that the existing insurance policies would indemnify the club. So potentially the clubs are taking a risk getting back on the playing field and exposing players. “If I was in that situation I would certainly be wanting to make sure that full insurance is in place, but they might not get a decision from insurers for some time. In which case, doctors and medical teams will have to cover their own backs and there may have to be new types of disclaimers signed by the clubs and the players, because certainly a doctor would not want that level of responsibility. “I’m not saying that a disclaimer would get a club out of trouble but it does make it more difficult to bring a claim. But it may be regarded as an unfair variation of a contract to sign a disclaimer to waive any claims arising from World Rugby has advised players to complete a daily questionnaire as part of a screening process on returning to training. The governing body also stated that “all unions should ensure that their policies require written confirmation from players and staff that they understand the risks involved in returning to training and playing”. Signing disclaimer forms would raise serious legal concerns, however, with the World Players’ Association, which represents around sportsmen and women including rugby players “We have seen some research that athletes may be particularly vulnerable to serious symptoms,” said the union executive director, Brendan Schwab. “We are concerned that some sports bodies are trying to place the economic and legal risk of contracting the disease on to players and that is something which we think should not be tolerated.” And while the issue has already reared its head within the Premier League Project Restart, Cramer believes it is all the more complicated in rugby . “It a bit easier in football because there is less physical contact,” he said. “It very different in rugby and that why there has been talk of disbanding scrummaging. The biggest danger is that with players who are training at their maximum peak, often their immune systems are lower because of the physical exertions they put on their body. “Personally, I think players might quite like the idea of getting back to work and training, but when it comes to that key moment of no turning back, they’ll want that high degree of comfort that they’re medically safe. If I was advising a player I would want to know exactly what level of insurance is in place and what the player is covered for.”",606
42,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/08/rugby-australia-descends-into-chaos-after-familiar-boardroom-turmoil,"t Rugby Australia the more things change the more they stay the same. In RA, then known as the Australian Rugby Union, adopted a so-called new independent governance model based on the recommendations of a report by the former Labor politician Mark Arbib. But given the backroom dramas of the current RA board, it seems not much has changed over the last eight years. Instead of a brand-new governance structure to match the likes of the AFL, rugby has really just seen more of the same. Rugby Australia appoints Rob Clarke as interim CEO after director resigns The RA board descended into chaos this week as it attempted to attract new leadership to guide the game through the coronavirus crisis and beyond following the recent resignation of the chief executive Raelene Castle . At a meeting on Monday the relatively new RA director Peter Wiggs was expected to be appointed chairman of the board, replacing the interim chairman Paul McLean, who had taken over from Cameron Clyne. Wiggs, a private equity investor and chairman of Supercars, was regarded as the ideal business leader to renegotiate RA broadcast deal and organise the resumption of play when coronavirus restrictions are lifted. There appeared to be a push for him to assume a powerful executive chairman role to become rugby union answer to the NRL chairman Peter V’landys, but it is understood Wiggs was either not inclined or did not have the time for it. Instead, he only wanted to become chairman and appoint the former RA deputy chief-executive Matt Carroll, currently the Australian Olympic Committee CEO, as RA new chief executive. If Carroll was appointed, the two-times RA chief executive John O’Neill may have been prevailed upon to return as a board member, providing further experience and expertise in running the game. The board refused to accept Wiggs call and appoint Carroll as full-time CEO, preferring to conduct a three- to six-month search to find a new chief executive, a decision which did not go down well with all the game major stakeholders. As a result Wiggs, the man hailed as the saviour of the game, resigned from the board after only days as a director. Maybe the board felt due process had to be followed. Perhaps it was uncomfortable with Wiggs call on Carroll. Whatever the reason, RA has denied itself an enormous amount of combined business, administrative and rugby acumen at a time when the code has never been more vulnerable. RA announced on Wednesday night that the former RA chief operating officer Rob Clarke would act as interim CEO. Clarke worked under the former RA chiefs Gary Flowers and Bill Pulver, who both succeeded O’Neill after his two separate terms in the role, and also served as the CEO of the Melbourne Rebels Super Rugby franchise. In the interim, Clarke will shoulder a lot of responsibility as the game struggles to survive as a major sporting code in this country. RA must oversee the resumption of play whether that is a Trans-Tasman Super Rugby competition, a domestic provincial competition or beefed-up Sydney and Brisbane club competitions. Whatever competition is organised, RA will have to sell it to the current broadcaster Fox Sports in the hope of deriving much needed revenue. On top of that RA must renegotiate its broadcast deal for to When Castle resigned, relations between RA and Fox Sports were strained over the former CEO decision to take the broadcast rights to market. It is also possible that RA will begin talks with the Rugby Union Players’ Association before the end of the year about renegotiating the collective bargaining agreement, and player salaries are bound to be a hot topic. If it takes RA six months to find a new CEO, most of the major challenges facing the game will be resolved by the time of the appointment, which supported the argument for a full-time CEO to be installed immediately. Who would want the job? We know Carroll wanted it, but would he submit himself to a formal application process? It may not be all that easy to find someone else of his proven ability. There has been speculation Hamish McLennan, a former Network Ten CEO with close ties to News Corp, will join the RA board at some point. Perhaps McLennan would be interested in the chairman or chief executive role. He has invaluable financial and media experience, but no experience running a sport. The RA chief executive role is a bit like the old coaching adage that as soon as you are appointed you should start looking for a new job. CEOs are accountable, but what about the men and women on the board? One of the reasons the RA board is not truly independent, as intended, is because the appointment process is not truly independent, although it is meant to be. When RA adopted the “independent” governance structure in a four-member independent nominations committee was established to recommend independent directors for election to the board. Those four members are the RA chairman, a nominee of RA and representatives of the two biggest rugby states, NSW and Queensland. That is hardly independent. The system of selecting the board needs to change before the nature of the board will change. Despite all the rhetoric about independence, board members are still effectively chosen by much the same sort of people who always selected the board, the same gene pool if you like. Perhaps this explains why nothing seems to have changed.",914
43,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/07/bill-beaumont-world-rugby-re-election-risks-global-rift-south-the-breakdown,"Bill Beaumont re-election as World Rugby chairman was not an end but a new beginning. The former England captain faced several hurdles as a player, but nothing compared to what he faces in his final administrative stint. His narrow victory over Agustín Pichot shows there is a danger of the international game splitting unless the next few years spawn meaningful change and an end to self-interest. Beaumont was backed by the Six Nations while Pichot harvested the votes of the four Rugby Championship countries: had the former Argentina scrum-half persuaded one of the European unions to back him, he would have won. His failure gave the incumbent a majority of five, but Pichot did not secure enough votes from the countries and associations representing the nations below what is called tier one to bring what had been a stealthy campaign to a successful conclusion. There was little to choose between Beaumont and Pichot in terms of policies, but the Rugby Championship countries have become frustrated at the ability of their European rivals to thwart projects, such as the Nations Championship which Beaumont floated last year only to see it torpedoed by Ireland and Scotland, although Pichot Argentina ended up not voting for it. RFU will need government bailout if England do not play until summer A central plank of Beaumont campaign was an independent governance review, but even when he delivers it, there is no guarantee of its recommendations being approved. Some campaigning for Pichot argued only he could drag World Rugby into the professional era, failing to point out the governing body is like the United Nations where the major powers are armed with the weight of veto. Beaumont diplomatic skills will be needed and he was the candidate best qualified to deliver change. The sports lawyer Darren Bailey argued in last week Breakdown that the current crisis gave rugby the opportunity to address three faultlines that had bedevilled it since north versus south, club versus country and developed versus developing. For all the talk of the need for a global calendar and greater harmonisation between the hemispheres, nothing radical will happen until the primacy of international rugby is established in all countries, which means the systems in France and England mirroring the other eight championship nations. Few clubs in France and England are sustainable, as the last two months have shown, but they have used borrowing and the largesse of backers to tempt players from the southern hemisphere at salaries inflated to more than compensate for either putting a Test career on hold or ending it. The Sanzaar unions responded by expanding Super Rugby to entice more out of broadcasters and help them to compete financially, but they were never able to catch up and diluted what had been the premier tournament below Test level. Australia – a country that, unlike New Zealand and South Africa, does not have a strong base – overextended itself and had no slack when the virus led to sport shutting down. Its union is looking for a new chief executive and this week appointed Rob Clarke , who filled the role for the Brumbies and the Rebels, on an interim basis. “The game is facing some unprecedented challenges,” he said before going off to find some answers. Australia, like the other southern hemisphere unions, cannot afford for the game to muddle on as before, driven not by a common goal or an executive with the authority to govern in the interest of the game rather than self-interest, but application of sticking plasters that are lacking in adhesive. “There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue,” said New Zealand Rugby chief executive, Brent Impey. “It would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally, not just for a limited number of unions and regions.” The south will not, because they cannot afford to, endure another four years of muddle and fudge. The slickness of Pichot campaign suggested it was not one that was hastily put together, and if Beaumont governance review, which will be set up under the former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson by the end of the month, comes to nothing the four Rugby Championship countries will have a choice to make: either carry on and let the Six Nations hold sway, or declare that if nothing changes they will no longer be bound by World Rugby tour schedule. The ultimate threat would be to break away, but where would they go? They would be out of the World Cup and have no more Lions tours. If Europe continues to oppose the plan for a Nations Championship, something that would offer emerging nations a route to tournament rugby, and with it any form of revenue sharing, a meaningful tactic would be to pull out of the July and November Test windows and negotiate matches on an individual basis. They may be helped, in the short term at least, by the lack of liquidity of clubs in France and England. The upward curve of salaries will be checked and there will be a review of salary cap levels and, in England, the dispensation that allows two marquee players to be registered outside the cap with no limits on their wages. World Rugby has the opportunity to lead from the front, but Beaumont can do no more than advise and help formulate policies. A transformative plan such as the Nations Championship should not have its fate dependent on the unanimous assent of the Six Nations or Rugby Championship. It is the old amateur way of operating, for the benefit of the few. Those days are gone, as Beaumont appreciates every bit as much as Pichot. If the last couple of months have shown anything, it is that the game needs to expand globally. Its footprint is too small. That did not matter once, but it does now.

Eddie Jones had planned to visit Marler for talks before physical-distancing measures were introduced, in an effort to convince him not to retire. It had been suggested Marler, who quit international rugby in but reversed his decision last summer, had become disillusioned after he received a ban for grabbing Alun Wyn Jones genitals during England Six Nations win against Wales in March. 'Hey horsey!': England rugby star Joe Marler bucks trend of dull sporting interviews The assistant coach Matt Proudfoot has held discussions with a number of Jones forwards, including Marler, in an attempt to “build relationships from a home perspective rather than a camp environment”. Proudfoot revealed the main topic of conversation with Marler was parenthood, and the former Springboks assistant is expecting to reap the rewards the next time the pair are in camp. “I try to have a list of players every day and [on Tuesday] it was Marler, [Ellis] Genge, Mako [Vunipola], Maro [Itoje] and Charlie Ewels,” said Proudfoot. “Joe was talking to me about his kids’ schooling and what he was doing with his kids and I can relate to that because I’ve got my own child. That relationship will benefit me in a couple of months’ time, when we are in camp.” Proudfoot did, however, warn that Marler form must be up to scratch if he is to add to his England caps. He had emerged as England first-choice loosehead during the curtailed Six Nations but his latest controversy meant another lengthy spell out of action. But because of the timing of the coronavirus crisis – and a secret Six Nations review – Marler ban will expire without missing any matches for club or country. “First, Joe has to be selected for the English side – we will need to see how players come out of this process and who is on form. But Joe is somebody I rate very, very highly. He an incredible rugby player. The question will be answered in the future about how well he is playing and what form he is in, as it will for everyone else.” 'A year to be better': Abby Gustaitis on lockdown and the lure of Olympic rugby gold Proudfoot believes players will need up to six weeks of “pre-season” before beginning contact training, let alone competitive matches again. World Rugby guidelines state that players should return to training gradually, initially with a distance of metres between them. The governing body also warns against handshakes, hugging and spitting, and advises that full training should resume only when governments have permitted gatherings of people. “If you were to equate it to a pre-season you’d definitely need a five- to six-week typical pre-season programme before you could introduce players back into contact,” Proudfoot said. “I think consultation will need to be done between strength and conditioning, medical, and coaches, before a fixed programme is put into place. There is going to have to be consultation done on this with club and country.”",521

Use hand sanitiser but avoid handshakes before the action begins. And don’t, on any account, touch your opponent balls with your hands – but rather use your racket or foot to flick the ball back to the other side of the net. These are just some of the guidelines that tennis players will be expected to follow when courts are reopened in England on Wednesday. The LTA, British tennis governing body, said it had contacted nearly clubs, coaches and venues with its updated advice on how to resume safely – with many confirming they intend to open where feasible to capitalise on the demand for exercise and the forecast settled weather. ECB poised to publish guidelines on recreational practice for cricket clubs “We are pleased that the adjustment of lockdown restrictions mean that people can get back on court and enjoy playing tennis again,” the LTA chief executive, Scott Lloyd, told the Guardian. “Even if you’ve never played or just haven’t played in a while, now is a great time to find a court and get some exercise by playing tennis.” Sebastien Blanchon, meanwhile, the head coach at Dulwich Lawn Tennis Club, said there was “mayhem” among members when the government confirmed on Monday that the lockdown rules would be relaxed to allow singles matches between people from different households. “Hundreds of emails have been sent and received – it just like everybody is throwing themselves at tennis,” he told the Guardian. Elsewhere Charles Morris, the head coach at Telford Park Lawn Tennis Club, insisted he had no concerns about returning to work. “I think it a pretty good sport for social distancing as long as you don’t touch your opponent balls,” he added. “When we play singles, we will both mark our balls and only pick up our own. “I would be more worried if I had to work in a school. Groups of kids are just too difficult. But on an individual basis I think it quite easy to control. I think I’m quite optimistic about that.” Tennis is not the only sport taking the first tentative steps to open up on Wednesday. England Golf says it is very confident that the vast majority of their courses will be open on Wednesday despite the short time frame to prepare – with many reporting massive demand for a tee time. One website, intelligentgolf, which helps club members schedule tee off times, showed an error message for much of Tuesday saying: “We are experiencing extremely high load, please try again shortly.” Gary Pearce, the managing secretary of Ganton Golf Club in North Yorkshire, also reported a rush of people wanting to play. “On Monday evening, I opened up tee time bookings for a week from Wednesday and it became pretty busy straight away,” he said. “I think we will see an initial surge because a lot of people are very keen to get back out there. We need more tee times than usual simply because of the restriction to two balls whereas people could typically play in fours.” Jeremy Tomlinson, the England Golf chief executive, admitted that most clubs would have liked more time to prepare but everyone in golf was “working their backsides off” to make sure they were ready in some form to accommodate groups of two going out from early on Wednesday morning. “We are so excited that we can start again,” he added. “To the best of my knowledge, the majority of those golf courses will be open on Wednesday. I don’t know what the exact percentage will be but I think it will be very high. Golf clubs, no matter what their size, will want to get back on the journey to financial stability. Paul Jubb puts faith in Andy Murray as he plots unconventional path “There is golfer pressure, and not just from the golf club members, but there another two million who play golf avidly who want to get back to playing. So there a great incentive for golf clubs to reopen.” Tomlinson admitted that many courses will reap no financial benefit from the initial reopening process, with clubhouses and pro shops remaining closed until the latter stages of the lockdown exit plan. “Without exception, the golf courses in England have been exemplary throughout this time, but the majority of them are creaking under the financial strain,” he added. “They have furloughed staff, they’ve carried out essential maintenance, the general managers and clubs pros have worked together and worked with us in trying to make sure golf courses could reopen at any point.” Of course, there will be no socialising at the hole for a while yet, while the same tough social distancing guidance also means that post-tennis drinks are still a long way off too. As the advice on the LTA website reminds players: “Do not congregate after playing. No extra-curricular or social activity should take place.” Even so, after seven weeks of being unable to hit a ball in anger, stepping on to court or the first tee will feel like blessed relief.",851
46,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/09/tennis-makes-tentative-resumption-with-some-exhibition-stuff,"n Thursday afternoon in Minsk, elite international athletes returned to competition. Two Belarusians kicked tennis off as the world No Aryna Sabalenka, and the No Aliaksandra Sasnovich, took to the court. Even in Belarus, where the country has relentlessly carried on as much of the world around it has come to a halt, the scene underlined the new normal. The pair humbled themselves to picking up their own balls and their stage was a small indoor hard court lined with one linesman per side and a handful of spectators. After Sabalenka sealed the victory, the two friends were not allowed to embrace. They tapped the other racquet and Sabalenka blew a kiss. They laughed. Paul Jubb puts faith in Andy Murray as he plots unconventional path Tennis has returned, but with a catch. As an inherently socially distant sport, it is one of the first ones back in some form. As a sprawling globalised professional circuit in the time of travel bans and mandatory quarantines, it is also one of the professional sports at risk of not returning at all in As if to underline the disconnect on Friday, as more tennis matches resumed, the Canadian government announced the cancellation of most sporting events until August, which will likely lead to the scuppering of this year Roger Cup in Toronto. The tour is set to return on July before the US hard court swing, but the future is still in doubt. In the absence of the professional tour, tennis has been carved up by borders as new national exhibitions spring up with every passing day. This month the Tennis Point Exhibition Series in Germany claimed victory over coronavirus restrictions. This weekend, the US network Tennis Channel broadcast the UTR Pro Match Series, an exhibition between four players held with no linespeople, set on a desolate patch of private land in West Palm Beach, Florida. The only spectator: a cow munching grass nearby. Some of these events have been erected out of necessity, allowing players to compete and maintain their level while earning a few small dollars – Dominic Thiem will imminently return to action in Austria and national competitions are also being formulated in Australia, Germany, Britain and Spain. Other private initiatives, such as the Ultimate Tennis Showdown masterminded by Patrick Mouratoglou, appear to have money primarily in mind. There is one clear issue: some national federations do not have the finances or talent pool to match the initiatives of richer European nations and their players are at another disadvantage. Although necessary, it is still jarring to see tennis partitioned by borders because of how antithetical it is to aspects of the sport. The location of the coronavirus outbreak alone underlines how tennis touches so many parts of the globe. As many of the eyes of the world focused on Wuhan for the first time, the most notable export is the two-times slam champion Li Na and its most significant annual international event is the Premier WTA event, held since Tennis was born as a localised sport with tournaments such as the French and the Australian Opens created as national events, but over the past few decades it has expanded its reach. While fans often identify their favourites based on the game styles and personalities they like rather than solely on whom they live closest to, players compete wherever around the world is most advantageous for them and they play for themselves. Likewise, part of the professional experience is interacting with different cultures. Today, most top players can fluently express their thoughts and emotions in English and interact freely with different nationalities. In the first Wimbledon of the open era, of men doubles pairings were of the same nationality. Twenty-five pairs of compatriots played in the event at the Australian Open this year. Next year Australian Open under threat, admits chief executive The nature of the sport also means so many players are multinational at heart; they were raised in one country, born in another and build their games elsewhere. The British No Johanna Konta, was born an Australian in Sydney to Hungarian parents, trained in Barcelona at before moving to Eastbourne and becoming a British citizen. The face of the coming Olympics is the Haitian-Japanese Naomi Osaka, who was born in Osaka, grew up in New York and is sick of people asking about her ethnicity. Even those who simply move abroad at a young age still recognise how their identity is affected. Russia Svetlana Kuznetsova, who moved to Barcelona at said: “The thing is what I found out really that I cannot work with people who speak Russian, because I speak Spanish tennis in my head. I won’t understand the language of Russian coaches, it different.” As tennis looks inward and nations take care of their own, those aspects of the sport will be present for a while. At a time when international cooperation has stuttered, it feels necessary to note them and to ensure that tennis reaches even more people when it resumes.",836

The main things were I just spoke to the people closest to me about the decision and what move I’m going to make.” Jubb, ranked in the world, has also been included in the Lawn Tennis Association Pro Scholarship Programme that provides up to per year to British players considered to have potential. After growing up in Hull and being based in South Carolina, he will now move to London. Next year Australian Open under threat, admits chief executive The decision to turn pro has been swirling in Jubb mind since he was awarded a wildcard into the Wimbledon main draw last year after his unconventional path from East Yorkshire to the US college system led to last year NCAA National Championship singles title. The pragmatism in electing to build his game and a backup plan at university, rather than immediately risking everything on tennis, is underlined by his initial goals. “For me it always been just trying to get inside that top You see a lot of people saying I want to be a grand-slam winner and all that stuff. Yeah, for sure, definitely. But for me it just always been about getting into that top and really making it my living and being able to play grand slams and things like that. And then once we get to that point, going full steam ahead.” At Wimbledon Jubb and his coach spoke with numerous agencies but Murray help was difficult to refuse. “I guess that is definitely now an option that I can use him more as a source and potentially have more court-time with him and be able to talk to him more and use his brain to try to help me on court.” 'They're not going to starve': Dominic Thiem will not chip in for struggling tennis players Jubb is already a distinct presence in British tennis. His mother, who like his father died when he was young, was born in Kenya and he grew up with his grandmother on a housing estate. He is a working-class, black British player in a sport that has failed to provide a path for many other players from a similar background. His route through the United States is a reflection of that. “It not traditional,” Jubb says. “Hopefully I can have more success and more kids around the country can see that you don’t have to grow up in a traditional background to get far in the sport. I would certainly like to think – maybe I am a bit now but even more so in the future – that I can be a good role model and kids can look up to me and see my story and how far I’ve come.”",531
48,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/next-years-australian-open-under-threat-admits-chief-executive,"The Australian Open may be eight months away and partitioned by a new year, but the organisers are already mindful of the possibility that it may not take place. 'They're not going to starve': Dominic Thiem will not chip in for struggling tennis players Craig Tiley, the Tennis Australia chief executive, told Australian Associated Press that the tournament, due to begin in January “will be compromised” as his team prepare a series of contingency plans amid the uncertainty of coronavirus. The organisation is modelling and preparing for four possible scenarios in their contingency plans, which are said to include the possibility of playing the tournament behind closed doors. “Worst-case scenario is no AO,” Tiley said. “Our best-case scenario at this point is having an AO with players that we can get in here with quarantining techniques and Australian-only fans.” Tiley comments reflect the grim reality for a global sport such as tennis at a time when international travel is restricted and many countries require new arrivals to self-quarantine upon landing. Even his best-case scenario presents a fundamental problem for the functioning of the sport, where players flit from city to city each week. Should the players arrive at the Australian Open, it remains to be seen whether they would be able to compete elsewhere. The tennis season is listed to return in July before the US Open. But the tournament Arthur Ashe Stadium is configured as a temporary hospital for coronavirus patients in New York. The US Open will make a definitive decision on its status in June but the Coupe Rogers, an important women warm-up tournament in Montreal, has been cancelled since mid-April. The French Open, now listed as the final grand slam tournament of the year, is due to begin at the end of September, just weeks after France ban of sporting events is due to be lifted. The issues crossing borders and timezones means the discourse across tennis is starkly different to that of domestic sports across the world. While other sports debate the conditions and timing of their resumptions, tennis players have consistently stated they believe the season is already finished. During his successful win at the Virtual Madrid Open, Andy Murray made his priorities clear: “Let just try to get things back to normal first and then we can think about playing sport again.” My favourite game: Andy Murray v Novak Djokovic, US Open final When asked about the rest of the season, Rafael Nadal told El Pais: “I doubt it. I am more concerned about the Australian Open than about what will happen at the end of this year. I see pretty much as a lost year. I have the hope of starting again next year. Let hope it is so.” As he waits, Nadal has followed developments closely and he offered a rare political critique to La Voz de Galicia that has caused a stir. “It is important that they get it right,” he said. “There are things that cannot be reversed. There have been mistakes. Sorry, but this is fair to say, it is not a political issue … Everyone understands that politicians make mistakes. It is human. I make mistakes every day. What I like less is when mistakes are not recognised, because you no longer have credibility.”",547
49,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/dominic-thiem-will-not-support-struggling-tennis-players-financially,"Dominic Thiem has firmly rejected the idea that the world top tennis players should chip in to help lower-ranked competitors who are struggling financially. The men world No Novak Djokovic , last week urged players to contribute to a fund set up by the sport major governing bodies, in order to help players affected by a shutdown which began in March and will continue at least until mid-July. No-vaxx Djokovic: why his spiritual world view can have a dangerous side The scheme has been criticised by Australia John Millman , who said the pay gap in tennis should have been addressed a long time ago. Thiem has taken things a step further, saying he felt there were others that needed more urgent help, and questioning the professionalism of some lower-tier players. “No tennis player is fighting to survive, even those who are much lower-ranked. None of them are going to starve,” Thiem told Austrian newspaper Krone. “I don’t really see why I should give such players money,” he added. “I would rather give money to people or organisations that really need it.” “There are many, many players who don’t put the sport above everything else and don’t live in a professional manner,” the said. “None of us top players got anything handed to us, we all had to fight our way up. I don’t have the guarantee in any job that I will do well and earn lots of money.” The man sandwiched between Djokovic and Thiem in the ATP rankings, Rafael Nadal , has said he does not expect tennis to return to normality any time soon. “From my point of view, I’m very pessimistic that the circuit can resume normal activity,” Nadal said in an online Q&amp;A organised by the Spanish tennis federation. “In tennis, you need to travel every week, stay in hotels, go to different countries,” he added. “Even if we play without an audience, to organise any event you need a lot of people involved. At an international level I see a serious problem.”",339
0,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/15/why-robert-pattinson-could-be-the-most-exciting-batman-in-years,"t is highly unlikely that anyone will ever win an Oscar for playing the caped crusader. Somehow, despite the remarkable enduring prominence of the dual role of Bruce Wayne and Gotham dark knight, the idea of honouring someone for being very very good indeed at dressing up as a giant bat to scare criminals probably has less chance of finding traction with the Academy than Uwe Boll has of coming out of retirement to win best film. The Joker? Well that another matter entirely . But this does not mean that the pressure is off when portraying Batman, far from it. Pull on the cape and cowl, and audiences and critics will still be mulling over your performance three decades later, as Val Kilmer and George Clooney have learned to their cost. There is no such thing as a cheap pay cheque for a forgotten movie in the era of on-demand streaming video, Twitter and the fanboy blogosphere. Fortunately for Robert Pattinson, he has signed on to make his debut in the upcoming The Batman at a very good time indeed. The British actor admission to GQ this week that he is not even working out in an effort to bulk up for the role of the gilded superhero might once have drawn mild criticism from knuckleheaded corners of the geek community, but now feeds into a continuing sense that Pattinson is setting himself up as the anti-Batfleck. Where Ben Affleck bulked up to ridiculous proportions to play a gun-toting, meat-headed mega-jock of a caped crusader, it is hoped Pattinson will represent a less showy and ultra-violent return to the dark knight traditional role of costumed Gotham detective in Matt Reeves’ film. Pattinson also hinted that he has found his Batman “gap”, the natural space to craft a unique version of the superhero that we won’t have seen before on the big screen. “I kind of like the fact that not only are there very, very, very well-done versions of the character which seem pretty definitive, but I was thinking that there are multiple definitive playings of the character,” he said. “You’ve seen this sort of lighter version, you’ve seen a kind of jaded version, a kind of more animalistic version. And the puzzle of it becomes quite satisfying, to think: Where my opening? And also, do I have anything inside me which would work if I could do it? And then also, it a legacy part, right? I like that.” While Pattinson may not have been hitting the gym, it sounds like he been preparing for the role in other ways, not least by examining quite where some of his predecessors went wrong. “I was watching the making of Batman &amp; Robin the other day. And even then, George Clooney was saying that he was worried about the fact that it sort of been done, that a lot of the ground you should cover with the character has been already covered. And that in All of which brings us to another former Batman who has been reminiscing recently. If Kilmer wasn’t quite so terrible as Clooney in the famous suit, he certainly runs gorgeous George a close second . (We’ll excuse Affleck for now as his performances are still a little too recent to have received a final and definitive critical appraisal.) Joel Schumacher Batman Forever is memorable these days largely for Jim Carrey spectacularly overcooked turn as The Riddler, a typical example of the comic ultra-manic early forays into Hollywood. Kilmer is utterly anonymous as Batman/Bruce Wayne, seemingly incapable of bringing anything to the role beyond the odd cheeseball one liner . In an interview with the New York Times , the actor talks about his preference for character roles – he mentions his turn as Doc Holliday in Tombstone , and even says he would have loved to have been a regular on Saturday Night Live. By contrast, he found Batman to be an empty shell, a realisation crystallised when the grandchildren of billionaire Warren Buffet arrived on Schumacher set one day and were completely unimpressed at the sight of Kilmer in full costume, yet fascinated by the Batmobile and the caped crusader other toys. “That why it so easy to have five or six Batmans,” Kilmer told the newspaper, suggesting that anyone could be in the suit. “It not about Batman. There is no Batman.” The comment makes sense to those of us who recall Kilmer supporting turns over the years with such pleasure. His turn as the irascible, ultra-violent Gay Perry in Shane Black Kiss Kiss Bang Bang turned the tough guy private eye cliche beautifully on its head, while his sweaty, cold-eyed Doc Halliday was a thing of jaded splendour . It easy to see how Kilmer felt his talents were being wasted behind a mask. And yet the idea that there is nothing in Batman to create a memorable performance from seems undercut by Pattinson determination to find something in the role to value. Perhaps, rather than an empty carapace, the dark knight is a blank canvas on which to paint one own ideas. Christian Bale, widely considered to be the best big-screen Batman, has admitted to being devastated when he found out that Affleck was taking the role. Director Christopher Nolan certainly played his part by delivering an intriguing, real world spin on Gotham in the Dark Knight trilogy, but the Wales-born actor responded with a nuanced, psychologically driven take on the caped crusader that stands in complete contrast to the one-dimensional figure of the Schumacher era. Where Kilmer opted out of returning as the caped crusader in Batman &amp; Robin because he wanted to do some “real” acting with Marlon Brando in the ill-fated The Island of Doctor Moreau , Bale helped transform the superhero genre into a space where high-profile actors no longer dare to phone in their performances. Pattinson will surely take his cue from the latter – honourable mention should also go to the excellent Michael Keaton – though it is a pity Kilmer time in the A-list came before the comic book movie really found its feet. He would have made a splendid Batman villain.",1028
1,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/16/the-making-of-looking-for-alibrandi-if-we-didnt-get-it-right-wed-be-crucified,"ursed women, shame, class, migrant identity, death – these are the themes that coalesce in the singular, coming-of-age film Looking for Alibrandi. Twenty years after release it has lost none of its emotional sting. Adapted from Melina Marchetta beloved, best-selling novel, the film follows the stubborn and smart-mouthed Josie Alibrandi (Pia Miranda) in her final year of high school. She navigates a jagged relationship with her matriarchal Italian family, including mother (Greta Scacchi) and grandmother (Elena Cotta), confronts xenophobia and class anxiety at her private Catholic school, develops a relationship with her out-of-the-picture father (Anthony LaPaglia), dates, studies and wrestles with her own in-flux identity. Growing up with Italian grandparents and attending a vicious Catholic Sydney high school, I clung to the book (and later film) because it held a mirror to my upbringing, previously unseen in pop culture. Beyond those specific similarities, it also understood that the experience of teenage girlhood is plagued by cruelty, cluelessness and soul-crushing indignities. The film thoughtful and yet unvarnished depiction of teen suicide remains especially resonant. The death of Josie friend and crush, John Barton (Matthew Newton) – burdened by the expectations of his powerful, political family – is a moment glued to the subconscious of many Australians of a particular age. It difficult to watch the film sombre and restrained funeral scene without sobbing. How The Chaser invaded Apec: 'A small video tape was secreted behind his scrotum' Written, directed and produced by three women on their first feature film, Looking for Alibrandi was a critical and commercial hit, winning best film at the Australian Film Institute awards in For the film anniversary this month, I spoke to Marchetta, director Kate Woods, producer Robyn Kershaw and Miranda about how the film was made, its enduring legacy and that heart-wrenching funeral scene. ‘This was the most-stolen book out of any school library ’ Kershaw: [Film producer] Tristram Miall said to me: “Would you like to read this book? I can’t seem to get the development happening on it.” I read it in one night and came in the next day, and said: “I love this. I cried. It was fantastic … [but] I’d only be interested if Melina was interested.” So he spoke to Melina, we all met, and then Melina and I started working on drafting the screenplay. Marchetta: I wasn’t interested in rushing into anything, because I felt that no one had really written about the cultural experience of Italians in a positive way, and I was very nervous about what they would do with it. But Tristram had just done Strictly Ballroom, which I did love. We had a few offshore offers, but a couple of months later I decided nup, I’ll go with Tristram ... I think they were just finding it hard to find the right person to write the script. Anyone who tried, you know, there was a bit of cultural insensitivity to the work. So when he brought Robyn Kershaw [on] as the producer, that for me started really shaping everything. Kershaw: I met with pretty much every single female director at the time. I think I knew that it needed to be someone who was coming of age, like I was. It was a coming-of-age experience for me as a film-maker, and for the director and for Melina as a screenwriter. Woods: We worked together for three years before it came out. I was very mindful that this was the most-stolen book out of any school library. That was a dubious honour. This was a really well-known book and a much-loved character. If we didn’t get it right, we’d be crucified. We put ads in the Italian and Serbian newspapers, we ran ads on Triple J, we wrote to the drama clubs of schools. We wanted to open up [the role] to where these characters could actually come from, rather than going to the names of teenage actors and actresses that had done the work before. We wanted it to be authentic. Kershaw: We auditioned more than people. Miranda (Alibrandi): I had to fly myself up to do a cattle call audition … It was almost like a dance audition. They read out the names of the people they wanted to stay after every section. A couple of years before I’d suffered the trauma of losing a friend, and I think I could access those emotions of anger and fear when I had to improv those scenes about John death. Woods : The way [Miranda] took on that role was pretty amazing. She really had an enormous amount of stamina and understanding of the character and heart and passion for it. She just did a beautiful job. ‘There weren’t that many Australian movies that dealt with suicide’ Marchetta : John Barton death in the novel is at the end, and people who were reading the film script were saying: “We don’t want a death like that dominating the climax of the story. Why don’t you take it out?” And I remember thinking: “Oh I can’t take this out.” I distinctly remember that putting his death in the middle of the story would be a catalyst for change for [Josie]. I was teaching while I was writing the script and when it was filmed, so I had the pleasure of my students being in a lot of the group scenes. Some of my students are the pallbearers in the funeral scene. Miranda: I find it really, really hard to watch people be pallbearers when they carry someone they love or care about. So for me, even though it wasn’t real, I found that really confronting to watch. Woods: That image of the boys from the school putting their friend on their shoulders was one of the first images I had about the film. I always knew that that was really important, because I could not imagine what it would be like to carry your friend under those circumstances. There was nothing perfect about Josie. She was every woman. She was the outsider and we always feel like the outsider Robyn Kershaw, producer It was just about getting the tone right … Obviously everybody really upset, but also you didn’t want it to be just totally morbid. I think that the music definitely helped with that. At one stage we wanted [Jeff Buckley] Hallelujah. But it had already been in so many films. Kershaw: Once we actually got that beautiful voice from Cordrazine lead singer [Hamish Cowan, singing With or Without You], there was just no turning back. It was just heartbreaking. Woods: It lifted it into a different sphere. It felt more poignant to younger people than the original version. Miranda: It was a tough day, but a good day because I knew we nailed it and knew we’d all taken it seriously. There weren’t that many Australian movies where they dealt with suicide – certainly that I’d seen – so it felt pretty important to do it right. I think the anger and confusion when someone kills themselves was conveyed really well in the film. It was also conveyed really well that life goes on after that person passes. it sort of a message to say, if that person had survived maybe they would have gone on with their life in a happy way as well. It sad to see their story end and everyone else continue. That what really gets people. Kershaw: My daughter, who I was pregnant with in – we used to refer to her as our Alibrandi baby – she actually watched it and had no idea about [my involvement]. When she was about or she said to me: “Mum, I just can’t believe I just watched this film. And I’ve been trying to watch it for a long time but every time it gets to a particular part, I just have to stop and I can’t keep going. This time, I managed to watch it all and it my favourite film.” I said: “Oh darling, what film was that?” And she said Looking for Alibrandi. I said: “So which was the scene that always made you stop?” and it was the funeral scene. ‘Everybody laughed and cried and was quiet in all the right places’ Miranda: We were just so proud of it; we’d all just worked so hard. We were excited too because it was Kate and my first big film and we went through it together. Kate always had this thing like: “I want to go see it with an audience and see what their reaction is, like where they are laughing, where they are crying.” Woods: I said: “You know, it an Australian film . It will be off in a week.” I took Pia because she hadn’t really seen it in the theatre before. We went to the local cinema at Broadway, near Sydney University. And we could barely get a seat – we had to sit right down the front. Pia was trying to hide because a couple of people had started to recognise her by then. She was watching and [her face] was too big and too close to her, and I was kind of watching what was happening behind [us], when everybody laughed and cried and was quiet in all the right places … I don’t think I’ve ever had an experience like that ever again in my life. It actually touched people in the way the story touched us … I’ll never forget it, ever. Marchetta : So much love went into that production, and I think it shows. There just something about it that still has that charm and has that passion. I could look at it and I could point out all the flaws of course, but it a piece of work that I’m so incredibly proud of being a part of, because I was part of it – I wasn’t the whole. ‘It was a new thing to see migrant stories in film told beautifully’ Woods: It touches everybody. I recognise my own youth in it. We all have that up and down, you know. It wonderful, it terrible. There no middle ground when you’re Kershaw: There was nothing perfect about Josie. She was every woman. She was the outsider, and we all always feel like the outsider. 'It was insane': Callan Mulvey on being Drazic, the heartthrob of Heartbreak High Miranda : It was a new thing to see migrant stories in film told really beautifully and where they weren’t the kind of quirky, annoying sidekick. Marchetta : I certainly believe that there is not enough cultural diversity in our films. I’ve said so many times that my greatest pride was that Josie Alibrandi was the first teenage character of Australian film in the century. I just think that it should have said this is the direction we’re going with our storytelling, and I don’t think we have. I think that we’re probably starting now, but what makes me so sad is it seems as if there a big chunk of our cultural identity that hasn’t been told.

Emily made a deal with one of the crew hired to gut the place and managed to salvage two neon lights before the skip bins were retrieved at dawn. By that point I was fatigued by the sheer number of cinemas that had closed during my own cultural lifetime, and vowed never to frequent whatever business would rise from its ashes. Four years later I found myself checking into the hotel on that very site, while visiting from Sydney to host a post-screening Q&amp;A at the Melbourne international film festival. The popcorn might stop popping, but life moves on. I get it. Almost all of my childhood and adolescent cinema haunts have now been shuttered. I grew up in Sydney north-western suburbs and my local was the beautiful Roxy in Parramatta, built in in a Spanish mission style. At one point my sister researched its architectural history for a university assignment, and I tagged along to her daytime site visits attempting to locate the ghost that supposedly haunted the upper level. Closed as a cinema since a proposal to renovate the Roxy as a mixed use development was mercifully stymied by the NSW Land and Environment Courts last year. These iconic sites are so often under threat, and unprotected by statutory heritage protection, like the long-closed Globe theatre. Like many, my nostalgia for the cinemas of my youth runs deep. The Valhalla in Glebe – whose printed posters I studied endlessly as a teen, wondering what Meet the Feebles was and why they recommended imbibing before arrival for a late night session of Baraka – is now an office block. The Academy Twin on Oxford Street sits dormant after being vacated a decade ago. The Mandolin on Phillip Street, the Dendy cinemas in Martin Place and George Street, along with countless others, gone. Add in all the cinemas that were closed before my time, and you’ve got yourself a modern cultural tragedy. Until recently I’d walk past the Metro in Potts Point (a theatre, a cinema, now the home of George Miller production studio) every day on my way to and from work, attempting to conjure up an image of its fabled Norman Lindsay mural, long gone. 'Irreplaceable' but ignored: The unique Sydney architectural gems thousands bypass every day Sydney still has a handful of very beautiful art deco cinemas like the Cremorne Orpheum and the Randwick Ritz; there are nicely refurbished Palace and Dendy sites scattered throughout the city, and it always a delight to visit Mt Vic Flicks in the Blue Mountains. Don’t get me wrong, I love a historic or upscale cinema experience – I’ve lovingly programmed Golden Age Cinema, housed in the heritage-listed Paramount House in Surry Hills, since it opened in and am now a programmer at MIFF – but the news that Event cinemas on George Street is closing has hit surprisingly hard. The strip of cinemas on George Street opened in with much fanfare (complete with a sign o’the times performing elephant), and instead of the current single Event cinemas configuration, it used to house three: Greater Union, Hoyts, and Village. I remember trundling along there as a child with my mother, pausing to paw through the poster shop that used to be underground, and returning later as a teen on school holidays (and sometimes during school hours too). I remember the midnight sessions of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and A Clockwork Orange, and picking up a friend who worked at the Village candy bar after her shift, where she’d change out of her uniform in my car, idling on Kent Street, before we’d drive to the same Britpop club every Sunday night. It not so much the particular cinema closing, but that we’re constantly losing different kinds of cinema experiences. I may opt for a hand-dipped choctop and a glass of natural wine while seeing a film these days, but megaplexes are a rite of passage. The new plan for the George Street Cinema site is for a apartment development which would also include a boutique cinema. As my friend Fleur pointed out on Twitter, gone are the days for people my age when “you would be a bit on edge going on a Saturday night in case you got rolled for your Nokia”, but megaplexes are still a hotspot for teenagers who – as I was – may just be starting out on a lifetime love of film. (Even my candy bar friend is now in an executive position at an international distributor.) They’re important for families who want to feel comfortable taking a whole motley brood out on a special trip, and they’re necessary for people who need to make the most of cut-price tickets and combo deals. The George Street cinema has also become an integral venue for film festivals in recent years – its sheer size alone allows enough of an audience to break even (or, in an ideal world, be profitable). It not so much the particular cinema closing that has rankled so many of us since the development plan was released, but the notion that we’re constantly losing different kinds of cinema experiences. One of the Melbourne cinema neons that my friend Emily rescued is an enormous “coming attractions” sign, and I’ve been thinking of that phrase often in the last couple of months as cinemas the world over sit in the dark and wait during restrictions. It much too early to tell what the cinema landscape will be like when they are able to reopen, with social distancing measures still in place and a disrupted production and distribution release schedule. Until we can be together again, be it clinking cocktail glasses at a small release film or ridiculously oversized sodas over a blockbuster (or vice versa!), at least we can turn off our own lights at home and partake in online film festivals or while away an isolated afternoon revisiting our own picture palace history . But I do long for the communal experience – endless pre-show and all – and live in hope that those spaces will be waiting for us on the other side.

It hard work, bloody home-schooling. The amount of printer ink I’ve gone through! I have managed to write a whole new movie script in lockdown, which I’m thrilled about. I feel too slovenly to watch TV in the daytime, so I still haven’t caught up on all the amazing series I’ve recorded, including Killing Eve and Homeland . After dinner, it whatever the kids want to watch. One of our favourite shows is , although we have to talk loudly through the inappropriate bits. It about the pains of high school for two grown women who play themselves acting with a cast of kids, and it one of the funniest shows on TV. The kids also love Fresh Off the Boat, so we’re all rocking the old-school hip-hop vibe, and a go-to is always Modern Family . We’re trying to educate our kids, so on the weekends we’ve been sitting down with some classic movies. We watched Car Wash and I’ve now realised that the film ensemble cast, comedy, social comment and blinding soundtrack have inspired every movie I’ve made. We’ve loved The Perks of Being a Wallflower and Queen &amp; Slim . We loved Knives Out , which gave our son a taste for thrillers, so he been watching Money Heist . I tried to watch an episode but it made me too anxious. I was like, “I can’t cope with this” and switched over to The A Word but my son said it was too boring because he was too souped up from playing Call of Duty and watching Money Heist. So now he banned from gaming for a bit. My daughter loves Bring It On and Pitch Perfect. We watch The Greatest Showman over again. We love a good musical. When the kids have gone to bed, I like to wind down with a good music documentary on Sky Arts or BBC Four whilst my husband is asleep on the sofa. I loved the stories of the Jam and the Hollies. My husband then gets up early to watch all the basketball docs on Netflix. He cried during the Michael Jordan series The Last Dance . Lionsgate is showing a live stream of Bend It Like Beckham tomorrow. I’ll be commentating on Instagram Live. It really hasn’t dated, apart from David Beckham having become a middle-aged family man. I’ve heard that the US team, the Women World Cup champions, all got into soccer after watching the film. I’ve been told that the England women squad know the dialogue by heart. Whenever it on, people like to tweet along, one of the most popular lines being: “Get your lesbian feet out of my shoes.” Stream Bend It Like Beckham for free on YouTube as part of Lionsgate Live, BST on Saturday May",478
4,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/15/together-in-the-dark-what-we-miss-about-going-to-the-movies,"inema is a mass medium. And since we film-makers want to get as many people as possible to see our films, we try to find a common denominator. But we also want each person in the audience to feel the film is whispering things only they know about. We want to achieve a paradoxical mass-intimacy. There are four key ways in which film attempts this – and manages it better than any other art form. Three of them occur irrespective of whether we are watching a film on an iPad or in an Imax. But the fourth – and possibly most crucial – is singular to seeing a film in a cinema. It important to appreciate them all in order to know what we have lost while cinemas are shut. And also what the medium must rely on if its future lies off the big screen. A life held in perfect balance When a film connects, it speaks to the head, the heart and the gut. Each of these ways of thinking – intellectual, emotional and instinctual – is directly addressed, then woven together and rendered mutually coherent. We are served something we all long for but rarely experience: our lives seeming to be in miraculous balance. Cinema is especially powerful because it can communicate directly with those pre-linguistic intelligences that lie within us. The question and the responsibility for film-makers is how to harness that power for the good, because it can easily be misused. For at its best, film could supply the braided coherence ordinary life does not. Such films would fulfil a unique social, almost spiritual, function, helping people to resolve contradictions within themselves, and then to align with each other in a healthy society. Deep secrets finally shared 'I barely breathed': Tilda Swinton, Emma Thompson, Steve McQueen and more on their most memorable moments at the movies Audiences are often surprised by a film apparent intimacy with their own inner secrets. This is the result of a film-maker judiciously deciding what to put in and what to leave out. If a film shows too much, the audience just has to sit there and take it, but they won’t feel a personal, emotional bond with the story or the characters. But if certain things are left incomplete, to just the right degree, everyone will use their own particular imagination to turn the partial into the complete. That is why people often differ in their sense what is a film has shown them. They may think they have seen the whole, but they are unaware some of the crucial elements have come from within. So in a sense they are seeing themselves in the story. As John Huston said: “The real projectors are the eyes and ears of the audience.” Authorised voyeurism As we watch a film, we are allowed to gaze deeply into the eyes of beautiful, ugly, powerful, scary, interesting people. We invade their space. In daily life, such close access is not often available. The people on screen, however, seem not to know that we are watching them, which makes it even more intoxicating. All it would take would be for them to shift their eyes a few degrees, look into the lens, and we would be found out. But until then, we can watch with fascination as thoughts and emotions pass like shadows, storms, and beams of sunlight across their faces. This proximity to beauty and power, mediated through eye contact, goes far back into our primate past. Cinema is the one art form that has found a way, through creative use of the close-up, to tap deeply into the wellsprings of this primitive and almost irresistible force of nature. The discomfort of strangers For the past two months, we have watched films only at home. But a film agency also depends on it being seen in a cinema at an appointed time, in the dark, in the presence of strangers also drawn to this moment. Walter Murch: searching for the sound of the God particle Under the right circumstances, a theatrical screening deeply enhances the experience of cinema. A lot of what can be said about this veers into the mysticism of collective consciousness – hard to quantify but certainly intangibly present. If we could somehow render visible the emotions and thoughts of an audience in the sway of a good film, it would probably resemble the beautiful arching loops we see with large flocks of birds or schools of fish. There is also the fact that when we leave our houses, at some expense (babysitters, popcorn), a little discomfort (parking, public transport), and risk (strangers! Infection!) and we gather in a cinema at a specific time, we are – by those very actions of expense, displacement, constraint, and risk – primed to see the film in a more expanded way than when we summon it on a streaming service. Technically, the quality of a film at home can now equal, or exceed, the quality at a multiplex. But what at-home viewing can never do is provide a communal experience to which we happily submit. In the best circumstances, that experience can paradoxically expand our consciousness and awareness of our commonality, sharpening our senses in the mass intimacy of the darkened theatre. And when we are in the dark, with many other people, we are especially alert to tiny signals from the audience that will trigger group laughter, screams, or tears. At home, alone, or with a few others, these signals are reduced proportionally. The larger the audience, the more likely it is that someone will get the joke early, and that first laugh will trigger everyone else. At the end of a live performance, there is a moment when the audience is ready to applaud, but uncertain of exactly the right moment. But as soon as someone claps, everyone will follow along. Humans have been assembling in the dark, listening to stories, since the invention of language. It is indelibly part of who we are and how we bond with each other. The theatrical experience is a recreation of this primeval gathering, the flames of the campfire replaced by shifting images that are telling the story itself. After the current hurricane has blown through the world, and we begin to pick up the scattered pieces, will cinema exhibition return to the way it was? Probably not in every detail – the universal lockdown has been an unprecedented shock. But I believe the deep human need to leave the isolation of home and gather in the fire-lit dark with like-minded others will provide an irresistible channel to guide the reopening of cinemas – and even, perhaps, their renewal. Walter Murch films include The Godfather trilogy, The Conversation, Apocalypse Now, American Graffiti and The English Patient.",1132
5,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/woody-allen-rainy-day-in-new-york-tops-global-box-office,"A Rainy Day in New York, the Woody Allen film disowned by high-profile members of its cast and whose US release was cancelled by its original backer, Amazon Studios, has reportedly become the highest-earning film at the global box office this week. With most of the world cinemas shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, A Rainy Day in New York is reported by Box Office Mojo to have earned over last weekend in South Korea, after the country began to ease its strict lockdown in recent days . Figures are difficult to come by, but reports suggest that A Rainy Day in New York total is well ahead of Pixar Onward , which took just over in Norway, La Belle Epoque, which earned in Australia , and The Wretched which took in the US. A Rainy Day in New York has been mired in difficulties since the revival of sexual assault allegations against Allen by his daughter Dylan Farrow, which Allen denies . Farrow op-ed was published in the Los Angeles Times in December after the film had finished shooting but before post-production was completed. Its US release, originally planned for was cancelled by Amazon , which was subsequently sued by Allen over the termination of their contract with the film-maker . Cast members Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Hall and Selena Gomez donated large sums to charity, with Hall saying she “regretted” working with Allen , and Chalamet writing that he did not “want to profit from my work on the film”. The film has however been released by independent distributors in multiple territories outside the US , including France, Spain, Mexico and Russia, earning around so far. It is due to be released in the UK on June.",289
6,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/11/cannes-abandons-physical-festival-for-2020-but-will-select-films-for-screening-elsewhere,"The Cannes film festival appears to have halted any plans for a physical edition for due to the coronavirus pandemic, but is aiming to sponsor screenings at other festivals and cinemas of the films that would have been selected for the festival. In an interview with Screen , Cannes artistic director Thierry Frémaux said he “could never have imagined” something like the cancellation of the festival, which was originally due to start tomorrow and was “overcome with a great sense of melancholy and nostalgia.” He added: “Under the circumstances, a physical edition of Cannes is hard to envisage, so we’ll have to do something different … Everyone understands that [it is] impossible this year.” The festival announced in April that it had been forced to call off its event in its traditional mid-May slot, after restrictions by French government effectively banned mass gatherings until mid-July at the earliest. However, tentative suggestions that a postponed version could be mounted later in the year appear to have been abandoned. Cannes has also appeared to resist calls to go down the digital route and construct a “virtual” festival online. Frémaux said that, at the beginning of June, Cannes would announce a list of films that would have screened in the festival; titles he mentioned included Wes Anderson The French Dispatch , Spike Lee Da Bloods, Nanni Moretti Three Stories, and the Pixar animation Soul. Eligibility is restricted to films that would have gone on theatrical release between summer and spring Then, Frémaux said, “the aim is to start organising events in cinemas” – what he termed “ Cannes hors les murs ”, or “Cannes outside the walls”. Details on how this will operate have not yet been finalised, but Frémaux suggested screenings are likely to take place at other film festivals later this year. He listed a series of festivals – Toronto, Deauville, San Sebastián, New York, Busan – which will feature numerous films, as well as the Lumière festival in Lyons, of which Frémaux is also managing director. Cannes is planning to jointly present films with the Venice film festival , which is due to begin on September. Frémaux also implied that Cannes had mended relations with Netflix, with whom it had a number of high-profile disputes after the streaming giant refused to modify its stance on theatrical release windows. He said that the presence of Da Bloods would have seen Netflix “return to the red carpet”. Frémaux also called for public and government support of cinemas, saying: “There will need to be protection measures, especially around rents, and economic safeguards. The way the Germans do it: no dismissals, and everyone stays ready for a return to normal. We protected the banks in so let protect cinemas, theatres and bookshops in Personally, to live, I need my bank. But I also need cinema.”",471
7,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/11/coronavirus-disney-reopens-shanghai-theme-park-with-many-restrictions,"Disney has reopened its Shanghai theme park with new physical distancing rules preventing Mickey Mouse from posing with customers, more than three months after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to close. Visitors must wear face masks, undergo temperature checks on arrival and be given timed entry slots in a much changed theme park experience. Tickets for the reopening on Monday went on sale on Friday and sold out within minutes. Visitor numbers are limited to of the park usual capacity. Only visitors with a green rating on China health QR code app will be allowed through the gates, further embedding the use of the digital passport-like documents that have allowed some Chinese citizens to move relatively freely, but which have restricted others. Some facilities such as children play areas and theatre shows remain closed. No parades or night shows will run either. “Close interaction and close-up photos with characters will be suspended during the initial phase of reopening,” Shanghai Disney Resort said in a statement. Disney closed the Shanghai park on January, before closing other theme parks across the world in March. However, the US entertainment company is eager to reopen facilities and try to make back lost revenues. The Walt Disney Company net income fell by in the first three months of the year compared with as the company revealed a cost from the pandemic . The company was heavily exposed to the virus, which forced the cancellation of cruises and the closure of the cinemas playing its blockbuster films – although the timely launch of its new streaming service , Disney+, has cushioned some of the blow. The group also scrapped its dividend, but it drew criticism from Bernie Sanders, the former US Democratic presidential candidate, and Abigail Disney, an heir to the Disney fortune , after it furloughed more than employees to save money on salaries, despite retaining large rewards for its leaders.

8,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/12/ive-never-seen-the-magnificent-seven,"used to be indifferent towards cowboys. I’ve seen a few of the famous westerns, but I didn’t grow up watching them. When lockdown began, however, I started playing Red Dead Redemption on the Xbox for hours every day, and my opinion warmed. Red Dead borrows from all the major films in the genre, and now I’ve finished the game I find myself hungry for more cowboy stuff. Next up is The Magnificent Seven. I know this one contains a famous theme song, which I recognise from parodies and adverts, as well as seven men who are magnificent in an unspecified way. I may have even caught snippets on TV as a kid, but they probably bored me at the time: The Lord of the Rings was always my go-to for horses and violence. I’ve also heard The Magnificent Seven was inspired by Seven Samurai, another “classic film” directed by Akira Kurosawa . (I saw this at university, where I briefly studied film.) Seven Samurai follows a group of samurai who are hired to protect a village from bandits. Many regard it to be the pinnacle of cinema, and likewise I thought it was very good. So I’ve retrieved my unopened DVD of The Magnificent Seven. A leaflet inside says that Kurosawa was “so impressed” by the film that he presented the director John Sturges with a ceremonial sword. But according to an interview in Kurosawa actually thought it was “a disappointment” – so maybe the sword was more out of politeness. As for me, I thought it was fun! Especially the first act, when Yul Brynner first assembles the Seven and we learn each of their unique character traits: the laidback one, the hotheaded one, the one who wears ties, etc. Brynner is enigmatic and Steve McQueen is cool, but my favourite is James Coburn as the steely Britt, who can outdraw a gunman with a throwing knife. I hadn’t realised that The Magnificent Seven is not only “inspired” by Seven Samurai, it a direct remake. The Magnificent Seven lifts the plot of Kurosawa film, changes the setting from feudal Japan to Mexico, and swaps the samurai for gunslingers. The story translates well into the old west, although The Magnificent Seven is over an hour shorter, meaning some of the nuance of the original is lost. Much of the interaction between the villagers and their saviours has been cut. The Mexicans don’t say all that much while the mostly white gunmen rescue them, which adds a racial undercurrent that hasn’t aged well. So yes, in one sense this is a glorified rip-off that guts the thoughtful original, repackages it with a stylish title and fills it with guns. But a fairer comparison for The Magnificent Seven might be A Bug Life, the Pixar film where an ant asks some bigger insects to protect his nest from grasshoppers. Again, it the same plot, but when I left the cinema in I don’t remember anyone saying, “Those ants are an insult to Kurosawa.” There are some new additions to the story, such as the bandit leader Calvera, whose role has been expanded. Eli Wallach does “absolutely livid” very well. The Seven spend a chunk of the middle of the film negotiating with him, which gets dull, but things pick up again at the final battle. There a sense of jeopardy here, even if a couple of death scenes felt rushed. I was furious to see Britt throw BARELY ANY KNIVES before he goes. Now for some more westerns. Maybe I’ll try the Magnificent Seven sequels: Return of the Magnificent Seven, Guns of the Magnificent Seven, and The Magnificent Seven Ride! Given that four of the seven are dead by the end of the first film, I’m very interested to know where they take this.",632
9,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/my-favourite-film-aged-12-mrs-doubtfire,"obin Williams was a constant presence in my life growing up – he was Genie in Aladdin and Alan in Jumanji, when I got older he was Armand in The Birdcage and Adrian in Good Morning Vietnam. He was cool and funny, and he somehow managed to be a kid and an adult at the same time (it wasn’t an accident he played a Peter Pan in Hook and an adult in Jack). I watched every single thing he made, and every new film I saw reinforced my belief that a) we would be friends, b) he was the funniest person alive and c) he had a big heart. In Chris Columbus Mrs Doubtfire he managed to embody all the things that I loved about him, plus … he plays a cross-dressing divorcee dad in a tartan skirt. When I was younger my dad used to drive me down the road to Upfront video every Saturday so I could rent a VHS. I watched Mrs Doubtfire one Saturday in on a battered paisley sofa in our living room. I watched it again the next morning before we had to return it. Then I saved up and bought my own VHS with my pocket money, and watched it again. I started secondary school. I watched it again. My parents got divorced. I watched it again. Daniel Hillard is a struggling actor using his considerable talent for impressions to do voice work, while being a husband and father to three kids. The film opens with Daniel being fired from his job voicing a cartoon parrot called Pudgy after a crisis of conscience during recording, when he refuses to voice Pudgy enjoying chuffing on a cigar. “Millions of kids are watching this, Hal!” he protests to his producer. Hal response (fag in mouth) is “If you wanna play Gandhi, do it on somebody else time!”, so after a quick Ben Kingsley impression, Daniel walks out. William character is set out within two minutes of the opening credits – this guy cares about kids. It happens to be his son birthday that day, so Daniel (questionable) response to losing his job is to make the snap decision to hire an entire petting zoo to come to his house. Sally Field plays Daniel frustrated wife, Miranda. Miranda has already organised a nice dinner and a birthday cake for her son birthday, so when she gets home after being at work all day to discover her house covered in streamers, her jobless husband dancing on a table to House of Pain, a horse in her garden, and a goat eating her sofa cushions, it is unsurprisingly the straw that breaks the camel back, and she files for divorce. At the court hearing, the judge gives Daniel days to sort his life out – get a job and a house, be a stable father figure or you won’t see your children again. Daniel moves into a flat by himself, and while looking for a job learns that Miranda is looking for a housekeeper. In yet another questionable decision (he makes a lot of these), he asks his drag queen brother to fashion him a prosthetic face mask and give him tips on dressing as a woman, before bulk-buying a load of cardigans and deciding to impersonate an elderly Scottish nanny to get the housekeeper job. My self was fine with this – “Sure Daniel, disguising yourself as an old lady to trick your ex-wife into letting you inside her house sounds like a great plan! Can you do another impression please?” Thus is born Mrs Doubtfire – the perfect nanny, airlifted into the Hillards’ lives to help the kids with their homework, clean the house while Miranda is at work and cook dinner when she gets home. There is a joyous hoovering montage set to Aerosmith Dude (Looks Like a Lady), and at one point Mrs Doubtfire plays football with the kids – and as an adult, the idea of Robin Williams running around a park in a dress shouting “Goal!” in a Scottish falsetto sounds like the product of a particularly intense fever dream. Marriage Story this ain’t. Having a bit of help with the kids also means Sally Field has the time to pursue a fledgling romance with everyone favourite hairy-chested Irish Bond, Pierce Brosnan. Tanned, white-toothed, and possessing a bottomless collection of light-coloured linen suits, Brosnan tries his best to charm Miranda while being negged by a nanny. Robin Williams obviously had a gift for physical comedy, and the slapstick comes thick and fast – a social worker visits Mrs Doubtfire at home after Daniel prosthetic mask has been run over by a lorry, forcing him to dunk himself in a cake to conceal his face. Hilarity ensues. There are fake boob jokes when he leans too close to the stove while cooking breakfast (“This hollandaise smells like burnt rubber”). Hilarity ensues. Daniel juggles two simultaneous dinner dates in a restaurant while dressed as both himself and Mrs Doubtfire, running between two tables and necking cocktails. Hilarity ENSUES. When I was I loved this film with every fibre of my being. This was in part because it made me laugh, but also because it has a big heart. Daniel Hillard is a cross-dressing Mary Poppins, and he becomes a much better father and human being than he ever was before he started wearing a tartan skirt and fake breasts. Eventually Mrs Doubtfire gets her own kids’ TV show, on which she responds to letters from viewers. A girl writes in asking about her parents getting separated, and if she going to “lose her family”. Robin Williams in full drag looks straight at the camera and starts a two-minute monologue. “Some parents, when they’re angry, they get along much better when they don’t live together. But if there love, dear, those are the ties that bind, and you’ll have a family in your heart, for ever. You’re going to be alright, poppet.” I was when Mrs Doubtfire taught me that if you’re a kid and you’re worried times are going to be tough, that true – sometimes they are. But don’t worry … everything going to be alright.",1033

11,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/14/tom-hardys-20-best-film-performances-ranked,"Rocknrolla There aren’t as many mockney-geezery roles in Tom Hardy career as you might think, although he has a turn in this and also in Matthew Vaughn Layer Cake, in which he plays one of the lackadaisical members of a crew run by Daniel Craig icily professional cocaine dealer. In Guy Ritchie notorious gangster drama he plays Handsome Bob, a bit of a lairy bastard, with a secret emotional life, who works with Idris Elba. The film set my teeth on edge , but Hardy brings some of his trademarked truculent charisma. This Means War This is a dodgy one for Hardy fans, although he gets points for an excursion outside his comfort zone into the world of larksome capers. In this frantic, strained comedy, Hardy plays a super-tough federal agent, a cockney superlad with a V-necked jumper and a simian walk. His partner is smooth hottie Chris Pine. Both guys fall for adorable Reese Witherspoon, and use all their spyware paraphernalia to spy on each other taking Reese out on dates. Maybe Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson would have been better. Venom Hardy deserves a high-profile role in a Marvel movie — and he is one of the very few actors who would be equally credible as superhero or supervillain. But this isn’t the one. Here he plays tough investigative reporter Eddie Brock, who takes down corporate bad guys in his weekly online show. But then he “fuses”, horribly, with a symbiote organism imported from outer space by precisely the kind of evil business behemoth that he exposes on his programme and becomes the monstrous Venom . The element of broad comedy really isn’t Hardy thing. Marie Antoinette Hardy has a tiny role in Sofia Coppola film, playing Raumont, the discontented nobleman at Marie Antoinette court, a young intriguer who is a keen enough participant in the power politics of the day, but without the status to which he thinks himself entitled. Hardy relatively low profile here is probably because he is not fully plausible as a pretty-boy figure and had yet to grow into a his bulkier, more macho looks. Child Hardy is here well into his broodingly impassive hunk phase in this hefty adaptation of the historical bestseller, set in the postwar Soviet Union and based on a real case. Hardy plays Leo Demidov, the soldier who hoisted the Red Flag atop the Reichstag in Berlin in and went on to become a security officer. He on the trail of a serial killer, but hated by the regime for his tough refusal to denounce his wife on a trumped-up charge. It a heavy meal of a film, but Hardy brings to it an actorly muscle-mass. The Reckoning Hardy took a walk on the wild side and was sufficiently confident in his own resounding masculinity to play a very gender-challenging character in this weird film set in the century. It features a strolling troupe of players led by Willem Dafoe; one of them is Straw, played by Hardy, who specialises in cross-dressing and applying lipstick with dainty precision before going out on stage. Lawless Hardy isn’t especially known for patterned knitwear but maybe he should be, considering his woolly attire in this gonzo-violent Prohibition-era mob drama. He plays the deadpan Forrest Bondurant, a hooch runner in Virginia whose jumper really needs a handwash. His brother is Howard, played by Jason Clarke, and there a nervy younger brother, Jack, played by Shia LaBeouf. Hardy slow-moving, cool presence gives the film some ballast. Warrior This was a film widely considered in its day to have brought the smackdown and delivered the action wowsers. Hardy plays Tommy, an Iraq war veteran returning home to Philadelphia to settle the score with his boozy, bullying dad, Paddy, played by Nick Nolte. The father contritely agrees to coach Tommy in his career as an MMA fighter, but Tommy opponent turns out to be his equally tightly wound brother Brendan, played by Joel Edgerton. It by-the-numbers stuff, but Hardy is simmeringly charismatic. Dunkirk This is just a returning cameo, but what a cameo and what a film, from a director who gave Hardy some his best roles. The scene is the victory-from-defeat miracle of Dunkirk , when thousands of stranded British soldiers were rescued from the beaches of northern France with the aid of a plucky flotilla of small boats. Hardy plays Farrier, the lone RAF pilot who engages the enemy overhead at almost suicidal risk: it a role supercharged with significance considering how much the RAF was resented for a perceived failure to provide sufficient air cover during the evacuation. Capone review – Tom Hardy entertainingly feral as a gangster at the end of the road Capone A very strange but arresting performance from Hardy as the prematurely ageing Al Capone, under house arrest in Florida in the last year of his life, suffering from dementia and syphilis, starting to hallucinate and displaying an unfortunate habit of soiling himself in moments of stress. Hardy growls and rasps his insults in Italian and English. Bronson Many Hardy connoisseurs believe that it was this film, from the Danish provocateur Nicolas Winding Refn , that really propelled the actor into the big league. Crucially, he gained (which meant he had a new Russell Crowe-type beefiness and solidity) to play the notorious British prisoner Charles Bronson (a self-given name, having been born Michael Peterson), a lifer whose bizarre delusions and propensity for violence in jail has kept him banged up for the past three decades. Bronson addresses the audience directly, like a droll and dapper music hall turn. It a strange film, but a strong performance from Hardy. Legend Playing twins is a test for any actor, and Hardy tackles it with gusto in this dual role that he was surely born to play – Reggie and Ronnie Kray, the hideous cockney siblings who ruled East End gangland in the Reggie is the supposedly more rational one, although without glasses, and Ronnie is barking mad, with glasses, and a tiny bit more weight. Hardy Ronnie has a perpetual pop-eyed stare of psychopathic disapproval, insisting on his own gayness in a growling voice, like a scary Tommy Cooper. Reggie, in all his comparative normality, is closer to being the film romantic lead. London Road This excellent, undervalued film from Rufus Norris was one of the most startling cinema experiences of the past decade: a movie opera based on the Ipswich serial killer case of in a reportage verbatim style, taken from eyewitness accounts – based on the stage play at London National Theatre. Hardy plays Mark, a minicab driver who has a choric function, singing about his own expertise on the subject of psychopathic homicide. He says defensively: “I’ve studied serial killers; it doesn’t mean I am one.” (But there is a worrying pause before the phrase: “I am one.”) It the nearest Hardy has come to Travis Bickle. Inception In Nolan dizzyingly hi-tech, high-concept cerebral thriller, Hardy plays one of a crew run by Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), an industrial espionage hacker whose speciality is to invade people subconscious in order to steal their commercially sensitive secrets. Or, in this case, to mastermind the implanting (or inception) of an idea that will break up a business empire. Hardy is Cobb man Eames, whose speciality is shape-shifting identity theft, a skill that is very helpful in manipulating the enemy. It a posher, smoother and more sinuous role than we have come to expect from Hardy, and Nolan film brings out all the actor latent style and menace. The Dark Knight Rises This was another of the heavy-hitter roles that put Hardy on the map in a big way. In the third and final of Nolan Dark Knight movies, Hardy plays the mighty and merciless Bane, who squares off with Batman. Bane is a man masked with a heavy leather respirator to hide an awful disfigurement and he is the leader of an underground army of the disaffected. Most perplexingly, he speaks rather indistinctly through his mask and you often have to concentrate very hard to work out what he is saying. He sounds like Darth Vader shouting, while playing the bass accordion through a Harley Davidson exhaust pipe. But Hardy never gives it less than The Revenant This was probably the most purely and successfully villainous role of Hardy career, although he might as easily have been cast in the lead. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the real-life frontiersman Hugh Glass, who was part of an expeditionary forceto establish a fur-trapping base in Missouri. Hardy John Fitzgerald is one of the shifty men working alongside him who abandons Glass to his doom after the group is set upon by a warrior tribe, and later claims extra pay for having supposedly given him a Christian burial. But Glass is still alive, survives against terrible odds, and comes for payback. In a way, Hardy is there to embody all that DiCaprio character is fighting against: he has to be a worthy alpha-adversary, not simply mean and duplicitous. His gloweringly malign presence bookends the movie at the beginning and end – we are heading for a mighty confrontation. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy John Le Carré intelligence thrillers are a far cry from the romanticised fantasies of James Bond. His is a world of dull chaps in dull suits trying not to think about shabby, shame-filled compromises and betrayals. But in this excellent version of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy , Hardy character Ricki Tarr is the nearest thing the drama has to a figure, surrounded by Ms and Qs. He a young, physically fit spy who has a bit of derring-do and womanising in his life, dramatically reporting back to Gary Oldman Smiley from his posting in Istanbul. He is not posh like the others, and he wears a sheepskin jacket, racy denim shirt – and Hardy also has a reddish-blond wig for the role. The get-up is borderline absurd, perhaps, but Hardy carries it off and it is entirely consistent with the period. Smartened up, Hardy will make an excellent Bond. The Drop Of all the leading movie roles Hardy has had, this is probably the most conventionally sympathetic and heroic. In a Boston crime drama that is adapted from a story by Dennis Lehane, Hardy plays a nice, ordinary guy called Bob, who works in a bar owned by his glowering cousin Marv (James Gandolfini). The place is used as a drop point by Chechen gangsters for their illegal cash. Bob rescues a puppy from a trash-can nearby and this quaint act of altruism and innocence sets in train a series of dramatic and tragic events. Bob is a unique figure in Hardy CV: he is basically likable and relatable, and Hardy face and style have always resisted this kind of ingratiation. His character is also quite vulnerable, being bullied by a local cop and accused by him of letting down the church. The Drop is, in many ways, an outlier for Hardy, but it could point the way ahead for his future career. Mad Max: Fury Road For the majority of his fanbase, this is probably the key Hardy movie: George Miller widely adored reboot of his Mad Max franchise – a bizarre convoy-chase action fantasia in the post-apocalyptic Australian desert, where a warlord controls oil, water, bullets and milk. Hardy plays the taciturn Max Rockatansky (approximately the character played by Mel Gibson in the original), a former interceptor lawman and now a lone wolf, tormented by memories of the wife and child he couldn’t save. He is captured by a hateful chieftain and taken to his stronghold from which he escapes in the company of the charismatic Charlize Theron. She is is to lead a feminist fightback against the misogynist tyranny that keeps the women oppressed, like farm animals, and she is to make common cause with Max. It is almost a silent movie role for Hardy, but his potent, bullish, violent presence and fierce face – rugged, yet sensually full-lipped – make him a living cartoon of rage in the desert sun. Locke This is Hardy finest hour, a film that shows what he really can do as an actor, when all the films that had made him famous seemed to have been suppressing the very qualities of subtlety and sensitivity that he shows here. Hardy plays British construction manager Ivan Locke, and the entire film is simply a shot of him at the wheel of his car, like a dashcam, as he talks to the people who are important in his life on his hands-free mobile. He is a dependable, professional, unemotional bloke who had been about to supervise the pouring of thousands of tonnes of wet cement into the foundations of new building in the Midlands. But just when he is needed there in person, Locke has abandoned the site and is driving south to London. He is having a marital crisis and an emotional breakdown, but he is keeping it together; Hardy outstanding less-is-more acting shows the awful damage that this is inflicting on him personally. It is a vocal and physical performance that could be compared to Richard Burton, but is entirely distinctive personal work. This is top Hardy.

14,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/07/documentary-spaceship-earth-isolation-film,"n September the final year of the Soviet Union and the beginning of a significant decline in trips to outer space, four men and four women donned bright red, Nasa-style jump suits for launch day in Arizona. They waved to masses of cameras, said their long-term goodbyes to a cheering crowd, and stepped beyond an air-tight door. But their mission, heavily covered in the press, was not to the moon, or into orbit, or even out of the state. The eight pioneers, part of a privately funded project called Biosphere were to be locked in a enclosed, self-sustaining structure for two whole years, on a mission to collect data and garner insights to aid Martian-style projects in mankind (presumed) extraterrestrial future. Circus of Books: behind a Netflix film about a mom-and-pop gay porn shop Documentarian Matt Wolf, whose new film Spaceship Earth chronicles the Biosphere project from its counter-cultural origins to controversial legacy – was nine when the experiment began, and missed the substantial media attention at the time. When he was poking around the internet several years ago and stumbled on a photo of the jump-suited Biospherians in their glass-paned habitat, he assumed it was from a science fiction movie. He soon realized the project was indeed real, and that many of its participants remained at a commune-style ranch in New Mexico. “I became determined to tell their story,” Wolf told the Guardian, particularly once he witnessed the cache of archival footage – reels of tape in a temperature-controlled room – kept by those involved in Biosphere “I was just astounded that they recognized the historical significance of what they were doing and were so rigorous in documenting it,” he said. Biosphere was an ambitious endeavor, to say the least – a collection of sealed-off biomes under a glass pyramid in the Arizona desert, intended to demonstrate the viability of self-sustaining microsystems on an inhospitable planet (or, as many participants warned, an inhospitable Earth). Biosphere named as such because participants believed Earth to be Biosphere featured a desert, a mangrove forest, a square-foot ocean with its own coral reef, and a savannah grassland; its eight inhabitants were expected to cultivate their own food and drink, and to maintain livable atmospheric conditions of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Spaceship Earth reveals how this idealistic ambition – funded, in this case, by Ed Bass, a philanthropic billionaire from Texas oil money – stemmed from decades of challenging, idiosyncratic work by a counter-cultural group known as the Synergia Ranch. Wolf pieces together early footage of the so-called Synergists, founded in by ecologist and certified metallurgist John Allen in the height of San Francisco hippy days. The Synergists, as the film genuinely remarkable archival footage illustrates, thrived on the convivial and industrious energy of their collective, morphing from Jester-style theater to communal ranch to building their own ship (!) on which to sail around the world. Synergist projects ranged from theater to ecology to architecture and science, “but at the end of the day, they were experimental people, they were adventurers”, said Wolf, who “defy the typical categories of hippies because they’re counter-cultural people who identify as capitalists”. Allen, in particular, cultivated powerful financial interests such as Bass to fund their increasingly ambitious, science-fiction inspired projects. (The name “Spaceship Earth” comes from the Buckminster Fuller book Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, which partially inspired Biosphere as well as the futurist ride at Disneyworld Epcot theme park). In the when sustainability and the pressing threat of global warming were far from mainstream concepts, Synergists found in Bass a partner in their mission to build a self-sustaining, miniature world. (Wolf, who said he intended for the film to focus on the Biospherians and not later conflicts over management of the Biosphere, did not invite Bass to participate; he does, however, interview John Allen, who served as executive chairman of Biosphere during the early The investigation into self-sufficiency recalled, Biospherians say in the film, the frontier explorers of the past. “It very intoxicating, that kind of idealism and rhetoric,” said Wolf. “And it proved not to translate in the mainstream media context.” Wolf incorporates news clips from the early which reveal a fixation on the project utopian ideals and counter-cultural background. Several reports from the time presented a duality for the project – science or spectacle? – as if the project couldn’t be both, or a harbinger of future scientific attention grabs such as Elon Musk SpaceX. One former researcher on the project called Biosphere in an television interview, “trendy ecological entertainment” (to prove the point, Wolf includes footage of two Biospherians mud wrestling before a crowd, peering through the glass with their home cameras). “I think one of the fatal flaws of the project is that they called it an experiment, and that comes with the baggage of academic expectations for science,” Wolf said. Biosphere he believes, was “a different kind of science, a whole-systems or total system approach”. Spaceship Earth review – intriguing Biosphere documentary lacks insight At the time, the conversation around Biosphere work was “largely dismissive”, said Wolf. “They had been dubbed failures and in most senses their life work had been discounted.” The fact that people often associated Biosphere with the comedy Biodome with Paulie Shore, “is in some senses a tragedy, given the scope and the ambition of this project”. Still, “what appealing about Biosphere is the spectacle and theatricality of it,” said Wolf. “This is a futurist project, and that is outside the realm of traditional science. We see it more in the dotcom sector now, in people like Elon Musk and others who are ‘disruptors’ outside of conventional or mainstream institutions.” The final third of the film, in which the Biosphere experiment encounters public criticism for its management unnecessary secrecy, fracturing management relations and financial hemorrhaging, introduces a surprising new leader: a famous figure from the Trump administration who wrings Biosphere idealism for profit, in one of several uneasy seedlings of the present. (It goes without saying that a film primarily about eight people trapped, albeit voluntarily, in a confined space for months on end has some … parallels to spring “The takeover of Biosphere is analogous to what you could call the takeover of Biosphere said Wolf. “We live in a time in which the political powers that be are sabotaging our ability to live sustainably on the planet through insidious policies.” There environmental deregulation, the (pre-corona) booming fossil fuel industries, but also the American gospel of profit maximization, which the Synergists could only escape for so long. The group goal to make economically and ecologically viable projects was “not economically sustainable”, said Wolf, who sees Biosphere as a “cautionary tale” of “this fantasy of industry and environmentalism coming together to protect our future”. Cautionary tale and imperfect experiment it may be, Wolf said he still hopes viewers “feel inspired by a group of people who literally reimagined a world”, and whose personal transformation in isolation “will be useful for viewers today who are now, like the Biospherians, quarantined”. Biosphere demonstrates that “the model of small groups coalescing around common goals is viable,” said Wolf, but with a balance: “As we re-enter the world with a certain determination to take new approaches, there are limitations to that idealism because of pervasive forces of capitalism and politics.” Spaceship Earth is available on Hulu and to rent elsewhere from May in the US with a UK date yet to be announced",1241

It a film about adapting to a worsening situation and being forced to realise what important. I thought it was elegantly shot and the leads make the film about people and not the situation. Available on Amazon Prime in the UK and to rent in the US Aniara Really enjoyed its bleak outlook at the vastness of space and how cold a spaceship can be. The depiction of humans also works well in our current climate. Worth a watch. Artie_Fufkin Available to watch on Hulu in the US and on BFI Player or to rent in the UK An Honest Liar Great little documentary about a famous magician who became a debunked con artist like Uri Geller and evangelical preacher-healers. There is also some personal drama that plays out as the subject is being interviewed that adds an extra element of intrigue. slicineyeballs Available on Amazon Prime in the UK and US Coherence This is a gem of a low-budget high-quality sci-fi film, with improvised dialogue performed by an all but unknown cast – the only exception being Nicholas Brendon, who brings just a tiny bit of the Xander Harris quips for our entertainment. A great one to watch without knowing too much about it. If you liked Primer you’ll love it. If you didn’t like Primer then [expletive deleted]. Available on Amazon Prime and Hulu in the US and on Amazon Prime in the UK Love &amp; Mercy Fantastically heartbreaking performances from Paul Dano and John Cusack who play Brian Wilson, both at different but troubled times in his career as he grappled with his deteriorating mental health while producing the album Pet Sounds.

I adore Call My Agent , which is the French one about a Parisian talent agent who handles all the top French stars who appear as barmy parallel versions of themselves. It utterly gripping, completely charming and at the same time your French gets better. We’re up-to-date on Homeland . I’m biting my fingernails watching Carrie getting thinner and more anxious. We’re on the final series of Breaking Bad . Walter has got a cold look in his eye. I’m thinking, “Jesse, what going to happen?” Gogglebox , I adore. Not the celebrity one. I much prefer – she says patronisingly – the “ordinary” members of the public. I’d be hopeless. I watch TV in silence. Even I don’t want to hear what I’m saying. My short film for Compassion in World Farming – Dear Humans – just won the People Choice award at the Charity Film awards. It says: don’t keep any animal in cages, which coincides so with this nightmare pandemic that seems to have spread from the wet markets in China and the disgraceful way we treat animals. When the great cloud has lifted, I hope we’ll remember what goes around comes around. I did catch a bit of Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie on telly the other day, which was heaven, just to see a bit of our beloved June Whitfield. My god, it had a cast list to shame. For feelgood movies, I love Local Hero, Shakespeare in Love and Paddington . Paddington was just delightful. Did I play Kurtan nan in This Country ? No. I haven’t seen that, I’m afraid. You know that thing where people have weird things put over their head and sing ? People thought I was one of them. It never me, darling. I did Celebrity Bake Off but I never do any baking – I prefer crisps – so my baking was very poor. Paul Hollywood spat out my cake, the poor dear. If you can’t do something, what the point in making the gorgeous British public watch you not being able to do it? I wouldn’t do Strictly . I’m so I’d probably get voted off straight away and then cry for weeks. Dear Humans is available to watch here .",386
17,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/12/cannes-was-meant-to-kick-off-today-mon-dieu-i-miss-it,"t the opening day of the Cannes film festival , in some parallel world where everything remains right side up. This means that the cafes, bars and restaurants are all open for business and that the old men play boules on that strip of dirt by the bandstand. There are films inside the Palais and sideshows on the Croisette. At the morning press conference, that excitable Scandinavian reporter is again on her feet asking Brad Pitt if he has any message for the people of Finland. Seeing as we’re in Fantasyland Cannes, let say that for this one time only he actually does. Cry me a river and break out the small violins but I’m going to miss the Cannes film festival this year. Even its glaring manifest faults now feel like marquee attractions. So what if it confusing and crowded, noisy and vulgar? How was this ever seen as a bad thing? Who cares that it exasperatingly French in the way it juggles arthouse austerity with glitzy Eurotrash and appears to see no distinction between the two. Again, that part and parcel of its charm. “All anyone does is argue about film,” a pained fellow journalist once complained as we guzzled rosé wine at some reception or other. I’d now like to go back in time and push him into the pool. In Cannes – yes, admittedly – people argue about film. They argue in a variety of languages, on the steps and in the corridors, on the street and in the bars. Thousands of people from hundreds of nations arguing about hundreds of films for days straight. Sometimes they’re not even sure what films they are arguing about – either because these films are so new that their titles have not been locked down or because a critic will mistake the name of a restaurant for an obscure movie in the Un Certain Regard sidebar and start claiming that yes, they’ve already seen it; didn’t think it was much cop. Genesis tells us that the Tower of Babel was a vast terraced compound inhabited by confused men and women chasing an impossible dream and disapproved of by God. It makes no specific mention of the Nespresso bar. The first time I went, back in I stood in the wrong queues and walked miles to the wrong venues and vowed that one day I’d understand exactly how the place worked. But the key thing about Cannes is that no one understands how it works and they are largely making it up as they go along. Nobody knows anything, to quote William Goldman . “Chaos reigns”, to quote the fox out of Lars von Trier Antichrist . Press interviews might be cut short after minutes or you may well be left there for two hours or more. The films are unknown quantities and even the credits can’t be trusted. It a festival of discovery. We’re literally and figuratively in the dark. I suppose the ultimate goal of Cannes – if such a thing exists – is to be among the first to sight the masterpiece ( Parasite ; The White Ribbon ; No Country for Old Men ) that everyone will be discussing six months down the line. More thrilling than that, though, are the pictures that simply floor you, the ones so outlandish and dazzling that you need a moment to decide whether you love them or hate them. I always think of the learned American critic who reeled out of the evening screening of Leos Carax Holy Motors shouting, “Will somebody please tell me what I thought about that ?” For several years, the Guardian budget was such that we were able to produce a daily video round-up from Cannes. This largely involved us running around the back of the Palais, being pursued by security guards as we searched for increasingly photogenic backgrounds to distract from the increasingly un-photogenic presenters. So we planted ourselves beside oligarch yachts, or on beaches and red carpets and argued about films for minutes or so . And if anything these distractions became too successful. They gave the impression that we were all prancing around the Riviera like absolute tossers, spinning roulette wheels and smoking Cuban cigars in the manner of Roger Moore and Tony Curtis in the opening credits of The Persuaders. Colleagues would scoff when we returned to the office. “Yeah, we saw you hanging out on the beach”. And this was my cue to angrily point out that actually, the only time I stood on a beach was to shoot that damn video and that the rest of the time I was clawing my way through the crowds and working really hard. Except that looking back now, I see that I was totally wrong and that those colleagues had a point. Yes, the festival could be exhausting but it was never less than a joy. Only a churl would complain about covering Cannes. Which brings us back to the here and now. The festival has been mothballed and the bars and restaurants are shuttered. Everybody stuck at home, bouncing off the walls while mentally projecting ourselves somewhere else. In recent weeks, for instance, I’ve caught myself pining for the Isle of Arran, which I haven’t actually been to since I was about years old, and an excellent bookshop by a river in Massachusetts that I’ve visited maybe twice. But mostly today I’m thinking of the press balcony, which sits at the front of the Palais, overlooking the promenade and the red-carpet arrivals. This is the place where people tend to gather at the start of the evening. They stand in the sunlight checking their phones, checking the schedule, trying to decide what to do with their night. The scene on the press balcony takes the same shape every evening. The same knots of people; the same gathering of breath; the same collective air of anticipation. It a moment that always reminds me – of all the weird things – of the ending of Roald Dahl Danny the Champion of the World, which is one of the great endings in all children literature. On the last page of the book, Danny tries to outline his plans for the day but his imagination fails him. So he simply says, “And after that something else. And after that something else”. Because he trusting enough to believe that the future will provide. Because he knows enough to know that the not-knowing is OK – or rather that the thrill of discovery is what makes life so exciting. That not a bad outlook to cling on to right now, whether it applies to your work or your home or an elitist film festival on the south coast of France. Cannes has been cancelled . Pretty much this whole year has been cancelled. But maybe that only makes feel more precious. So I’m looking forward to the next edition, whenever it happens and however it looks. It will be good to stand on the press balcony again and then step inside to see whatever is playing. The next Parasite, the next Tree of Life , the next Un Prophète , and after that something else.",1199
18,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/04/gladiator-at-20-how-ridley-scott-epic-rejuvenated-the-historical-blockbuster,"oey, do you like movies about gladiators?” the creepy pilot asks the small boy in Airplane!. To younger audiences, the joke no longer makes any sense. In Airplane! day, sword-and-sandals movies had become an outdated, unwittingly homoerotic joke. But then came Gladiator , and the joke was on us. Released years ago this month, Ridley Scott Roman epic gave the old cliches a new lease of life. It was all here: Colosseum action! Rippling man-flesh! Tigers! But Gladiator had its cheesecake and ate it. It served up crowd-pleasing spectacle and airline-ad visuals but also solemn, Oscar-worthy drama (and, in retrospect, a fair degree of camp). The Guide: Staying In – sign up for our home entertainment tips Gladiator was one of the first movies to make use of CGI technology to recreate actual history, rather than aliens and monsters. Its ancient Rome, packed with virtual crowds, looks like a video game at times, but back in it was groundbreaking. Others took note. Within a few years we had a mini sword-and-sandals revival: Troy, Alexander, King Arthur. By Zack Snyder overblown the genre had devolved back into parody, but it has never really gone away: Joaquin Phoenix incestuous despot in Gladiator has a very Game of Thrones vibe to him, for example. Ridley Scott tried to repeat the original formula himself, first with the Crusades drama Kingdom of Heaven , which only proved that Orlando Bloom was no Russell Crowe , then with Robin Hood, which proved that Russell Crowe wasn’t exactly his former self, either. Gladiator was the pinnacle of Crowe career (he won the best actor Oscar) but also the beginning of his transition from commanding Hollywood lead to grumpy, difficult diva. The way Crowe tells it, he “rescued” Gladiator, giving it his all on-screen and whipping the awful script into shape off it. You get the impression Crowe has thought of himself as the boss ever since, hence the stories of bad behaviour, the irritable press interviews, the abortive second career as a rock star. He has mellowed somewhat recently, using his menace to good effect in True History of the Kelly Gang , and as Roger Ailes in The Loudest Voice , but the steady ascent of Joaquin Phoenix career is a study in contrasts – and, perhaps, ego management. Phoenix tends to disappear into his characters; Crowe real-life persona often overshadows his. Now Gladiator is ancient history itself but, in some ways, its story is more relevant now than it was then: an undeserving despot who hijacks a mighty empire and betrays its principles, who sidelines the wise politicians and distracts the citizens from his corruption with violent, populist spectacle. “Fear and wonder, a powerful combination,” as Derek Jacobi sidelined senator puts it. Gladiator both served it up and warned us against it.",467
19,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/28/online-film-festival-we-are-one-cannot-replace-cinema,"very year, at Cannes (and other festivals) there a plaintive argument about what Cannes (or other festivals) are really all “about”. Some Savonarola-type person will dash the glass of rosé out of your hand, throw your canape into the Med and tell you Cannes is not about red-carpet narcissism, not about stars preening in the flashbulb glare of celeb-worship, not about L’Oréal sponsorship, not about getting drunk at a million late-night parties. It about the movies, about cinema itself. Of course. And that what the new We Are One: A Global Film Festival appears to offer: the online festival, beginning May, curated by Jane Rosenthal of the Tribeca film festival, featuring arthouse films (though not the big-ticket Hollywood items) from Cannes, Venice, Berlin and many more, streaming for free in return for an optional donation to the World Health Organization fund. So there you have it. A festival with all the frills and extras and flummeries stripped away. Just you, in your bedroom, with your laptop, communing with cinema. Isn’t that what it all about? Well … no, of course not. For a start, cinema has to be about the big screen, people all joined together in the dark, with no social distancing, thrilling to the communal experience – which sadly was also the attraction of the Cheltenham Gold Cup . It has to be said that Thierry Frémaux, artistic director of Cannes, appears to have relaxed his objections on this score, just a little; having initially derided suggestions that Cannes itself would go virtual, now he has allowed some Cannes titles to go into the We Are One mix. And there have already been gags on Twitter about how online festivals will have virtual queuing – a “wheel of death” buffering delay that may or may not end after minutes. And after all, the whole business of streaming has – for the moment – kept cinema alive: new films can get released for streaming during the lockdown (although the halt to production may well cause a famine a year or so down the line). The cinema experience is soldiering on – and for many people, for many otherwise inaccessible world cinema films, it has already been small-screen. And the films included in this online festival will be just this kind of movie. The difference, naturally, is money. Streaming isn’t usually free, although there almost a gold rush in progress now among film writers and cinephiles to find old movies available gratis on YouTube . This We Are One Festival is basically going to be a loss leader for all the big festivals, who might now be effectively conceding the reality that is the year of cancellation (though Berlin and Dublin escaped), putting aside their habitual competition with each other and making the best of things. They want to keep their various brand identities alive, though many will want to make no secret of the fact that this temporary arrangement, however bold with its We-Are-The-World body language, is indeed second-best. Festival directors will want to get people back to the real-live event with ticket sales, sponsorship, and the boost to their cities’ economies and international prestige – in Or But there is a possibility that the We Are One online festival could be a “legacy” project, as they say during the Olympics. It could be a new way of people engaging with cinema. There could be an audience award, with people voting online the way Bafta members do, with every individual required to register with an email username and password. And if the We Are One entire selection is kept online for the entire period, as opposed to each title being available for just one or two days (the way it would be in a non-virtual event) then this might be a way of getting round a perennial festival problem – everyone hearing in the first few days about a great new film from a talented young film-maker, only to find there are no more screenings. We Are One could, in some modified form, survive as an annual event around November or December. But in the end, after this is all over, people will want to go back to the flesh and blood experience, to see the films on the big screen, that sense of occasion that is the vital curatorial tool for focusing minds on a new film. And people will want to talk about films: talk about them over coffee, over lunch, in the street outside in the cinema. That is the festival experience.",756
20,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/15/tigertail-alan-yang-coronavirus-racism-lockdown-bigotry,"nflamed by President Trump casual phrase “Chinese virus”, anti-Asian sentiment is erupting all over the world. As a British-Vietnamese person who has been spat on because of the colour of her skin, the film Tigertail is a glimmer of hope – a way of showing the truth, and connecting Asian communities at a time when panic and misinformation serve to break us apart. Alan Yang multi-generational love story Tigertail weaves in Yang cultural self-discovery and features memories of Taiwan, as experienced by the protagonist Pin-Jui. Weighted against the present tide of anti-Asian bigotry, this tender story about honesty and lost love is more relevant than ever. “American culture has been negligent in portraying Asian-American people as fully realised human beings,” Yang told the Deadline podcast . Yang, who worked on Parks and Recreation before co-creating Master of None , recalled the trepidation he felt in the early days of his career, in a cultural landscape where east Asians were rarely represented, or stereotyped as hardworking automatons. Yang said he had felt restricted to using only white characters in his early pilots, fearing that all-Asian or Asian-American scripts would never be accepted. But this was before the film successes of Crazy Rich Asians , The Farewell and Parasite brought real Asian faces to mainstream culture. I felt utter joy and relief at seeing my own identity conflicts explored on screen. With dialogue almost entirely in Mandarin and Taiwanese from an all-Asian cast, Tigertail illuminates the Taiwanese immigrant experience by showing it through emotions. Yang drama traces the journey of Taiwanese factory worker Pin-Jui from his home town to America, as well as the sometimes painful discord that separates us from those we love the most. A rallying cry against caricatures of the stoic “Asian dad”, Tigertail lays bare the complexity of Pin-Jui interiority: the path he takes towards his American dream, how he stumbles and learns from his mistakes and how he grows from them. The film moves between his life as a young man in the and the present day in New York. The dual time-frames reveal a mind shifting uneasily between a new, chosen culture and the vibrant one left behind. In the present-day timeline – deliberately desaturated and drained of vibrancy – an older Pin-Jui struggles to empathise with his US-born daughter Angela, who has spent her life feeling as if she couldn’t talk to her father. That resonated deeply with me. My parents fled to Britain as Vietnamese refugees in their late teens. Because my father speaks very basic English and I speak poor Vietnamese, honest feelings cannot easily be communicated between us. The unrest within Asian families comes not from what is said out loud, but often from what is left unsaid. This cultural muteness echoes throughout Tigertail. In the film opening sequence, a young Pin-Jui sobs in desperation for his parents. “Crying never solves anything,” his grandmother scolds him sternly in Taiwanese. “Be strong. Never let anyone see you cry.” In many Asian traditions, including my own, the way to be strong is to conceal your emotions. But non-traditional circumstances call upon us to readjust. How can this silence persist during a global pandemic, when the elderly are being asked to isolate themselves entirely? Piecing together my family story has helped me grasp the sacrifices that my family made in order to secure hope for the next generation. It brought me closer to my parents. I’ve learned to appreciate their perspective and our differences. Like Pin-Jui leap into the unknown, my family journey paved the way for successive generations, even if each generation is a little further from that original sacrifice, a little more removed from the country that was once home. While Yang personal life informs Tigertail in many ways, the film is also about being human and knowing that we can’t face hurt on our own. It reinforces the perseverance and strength of the Asian community in embracing new lives, often at the cost of giving up another. Tigertail window into a Taiwanese-American family speaks volumes for those who have felt unable to express themselves, through being marginalised or because they don’t know how to.

21,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/14/covid-19-killed-the-film-industry-hollywood-coronavirus,"any events have killed the film industry: the influenza epidemic, the second world war, the invention of television, the invention of VCRs, the invention of the internet, strike after strike after strike. And yet, like a phoenix, it rises, every time stronger than before. The appetite for its product is insatiable especially in times of political trouble and uncertainty about the future. People want to escape. They want to be entertained. The way we make movies most certainly must change. In the best of circumstances, we are a crew of people jammed into a room with very little ventilation, holding our breath until we hear “CUT”. We are in close contact with one another all day long. We never really thought about it before. All of that is about to change. Film sets usually function as big families, and moving forward, that family unit will take on a stronger, protective meaning. This is how we self-regulate in the post-pandemic era. Most crews working on projects that went down during the pandemic were given a week, sometimes two weeks’ worth of pay, but that hardly enough to get us through the next few months. Huge donations from Netflix and the Academy (among others) have filled the tills of the Actors Fund and Motion Picture Television Fund, offering assistance to crew in times of need. The UK has the Film and TV Emergency Relief Fund . We still have to pay the rent or the mortgage. Everyone will find their own way to cope in this vacuum. Many of us may go into debt. But there is good news: the development pipeline is bursting with new projects. Virtual writers’ rooms are up and running for new shows. The moment we are allowed to go back to work (and many surmise at this point that it will be late July or August), the industry is going to explode with business. This is where it gets complicated. All of those shows that were in mid-production at the shutdown? Their sets are still set up on those soundstages that are now going to be in high demand by new projects. The actors working on those shows? They have commitments already booked for July and August that will require shuffling, in order to complete the old project that was shuttered. The feeling across the industry is one of cooperation – we are all in this together, and we will work with each other to get ourselves back on our feet. The film industry loves nothing more than a good comeback. Harder to penetrate may be the insurance market for new projects. In order to shoot a film or TV show, production insurance is required – you need proof of this to secure locations, to hire talent, and to be bonded. At the moment, insurers are writing policies with exclusions for or pandemic claims. Studio projects will have little trouble buying out the exclusion. Independents will find it cost-prohibitive. The insurance market is going to need the same cohesion and cooperation we are seeing in development and production. Any hesitation in this sector will delay recovery. We need to work together. Finally, the existential question – the one that has plagued Hollywood for the past three years – the discussion no one wants to have. Is a film still a film if it doesn’t play in a theatre? How do we define a “film”? Is it its method of exhibition that makes it so? Or is it its format and content: minutes of narrative? In the absence of theatrical release, because cinemas are closed, films are being fast-tracked to VOD or streaming. Does that make it less than a film? What will happen at awards season, if we are not allowed to congregate to watch these films on the big screen? Would they not be considered films? Would they not be nominated for Oscars? The pandemic is forcing this discussion, one that has taken too long to resolve. Our method of distributing content has changed fundamentally. If our industry is to boom again, we need to get on the same page in the way we think about film, and content in general. Now is the time to embrace the change the pandemic has brought us. Here is an opportunity to redefine who and what the industry is, and the quicker it can be done, the better off it will be. The business is built on passion, and that is pandemic-proof. No, the film biz is not dead. Not by a long shot. It is merely getting ready for its closeup.",763
22,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/23/wtaf-jonah-hill-samuel-l-jackson-swearing-in-the-movies,"ith the movie industry shut down due to coronavirus , now is a valuable time for us to look back and properly examine the attraction that we have to certain figures. Are we drawn to Tom Hanks because he exudes a sense of benevolent paternalism that we tend to find subconsciously appealing? Do we flock to Marvel films because we seek the clarity of a good-v-evil dynamic in a world where those are becoming increasingly opaque? And why do people go and see Jonah Hill films? Seriously, why? Fortunately, there is finally an answer to the latter. It because Jonah Hill swears quite a lot. In fact, that doing him a disservice. Jonah Hill swears more than any other actor in the history of Hollywood. Thanks to a study by Buzz Bingo – whose previous hits include “Which actor has been killed the most” and “Which actor is most likely to die?” – we now know that Jonah Hill has said a swearword on screen times over the course of his career. That an awful lot of swearing. For comparison, Samuel L Jackson – a man who you’d assume would be swearier than Hill given that a) he has more film credits than Hill, b) six of those were Quentin Tarantino films and c) another six of them took place before Jonah Hill was even born – has only said swearwords in film. In his last Shaft film alone, Samuel L Jackson said “motherfucker” times. And he still swearwords behind Jonah Hill. That what a world-class swearer Jonah Hill is. Why is Jonah Hill so prolific at swearing? Key to the answer is his participation in The Wolf of Wall Street , which is the sweariest film ever made. According to the study, there are swearwords in The Wolf of Wall Street. Six years ago, Vulture handily broke down that film swearing , revealing uses of the word “fucking”, uses of “fuck”, three uses of “cunt”, one “fuckhead”, one “fuckface”, one “fuckity” and, surprisingly, four separate incidences of “fucksville”. And it turns out that Jonah Hill is responsible for a seventh of all of them. But there must be more to it than just The Wolf of Wall Street, because Leonardo DiCaprio swears three times more than Jonah Hill in that film, and yet he can only achieve the silver medal of lifetime swears. This is because almost all of DiCaprio swearing is concentrated in this one film. Jonah Hill, meanwhile, has made a lifetime work of it. In his out-and-out comedy days, Hill made his name with an improvisational approach that often relied on swearing as a crutch. There are about “fucks” and the same number of “shits” in The Sitter, “fucks” in Get Him to the Greek, “fucks” in This is the End and more than “fucks” in the Jump Street series. What this means, in effect, is that he would be much further down the list if he made films with better scripts. So well done to Jonah Hill, who must be very proud. And commiserations to Samuel L Jackson. Thanks to Uncut Gems , Adam Sandler is now just six swears behind Jackson and closing fast. You’d assume that Jackson would want to do something quickly to shore up his reputation. If there was any justice in the world, the home release of The Rise of Skywalker would include a rerecorded voice snippet of Mace Windu screaming a torrent of awful language at a horrified Rey. Just “fucks” and he’d be back on top.",588
23,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/max-von-sydow-an-aristocrat-of-cinema-who-made-me-weep,"he opening of the seventh seal in the Book of Revelation, disclosing the truth of God existence and the second coming, will result in a mysterious silence in the kingdom of heaven – then the sound of trumpets and the thunderous uproar of Earth apocalyptic ending. In the movies, no actor has ever represented these ideas more seriously, nor shown humanity anguish in the face of God implacable silence or unassuageable anger more clearly, than Max von Sydow . He was virtually a book of revelation in himself. The passionate severity of Von Sydow – and his ability to impersonate the ascetic nobility of some impossibly remote priestly or knightly order but with very human flaws – formed the bedrock of Ingmar Bergman The Seventh Seal and the staggering series of films he was to make with Bergman in the and Beyond that, he virtually epitomised an entire, distinctively high-minded attitude to cinematic art in Europe. His films for Bergman were composed in a movie idiom that drew on Ibsen and Strindberg, Sjöström and Dreyer – and of which, since Bergman death in Von Sydow could be said to be the final standard bearer. This was the handsome, sensitive face unforgettably haunted by fear, love, the heroic burden of faith and the terrible inevitability of death looming checkmate in The Seventh Seal. He was the crusader knight who returns from his futile theocratic military adventure to find his country ravaged with plague and consumed with panic about the imminent end of everything. Surveying this catastrophe of hubris and cruelty, he is haunted by the angel of death, with whom he plays a fateful game of chess; he must come to terms with what this implies about humanity creator and the final terrible judgment. The Seventh Seal to The Exorcist: Max von Sydow – a life in pictures Von Sydow exemplified a fierce seriousness and high principle that lived on in the equally outstanding work he was to do with directors such as William Friedkin , George Stevens, Woody Allen, Bille August and Julian Schnabel. It was not typecasting, exactly, but more a question of directors recognising his vocation as an actor. In Bergman The Virgin Spring he was the father seeking a ruthless revenge for the rape and murder of his daughter: he was virtually an avenging God himself. In Through a Glass Darkly he is a man crucified by his wife mental illness, and in Winter Light he is the parishioner agonised by a crisis of faith. Perhaps it is in this movie that Von Sydow conveys a gaunt protestantism of personal pain. Von Sydow made a creditable job of playing Jesus in Stevens’ The Greatest Story Ever Told in but this well-meaning and stately film (much teased for John Wayne drawlingly awe-struck centurion at the crucifixion scene) was too carefully respectful to tap into Von Sydow dark power. But what can’t be underestimated in Von Sydow career is his magnificent – and important – work in horror classic The Exorcist in And in the role of the exorcist himself, his face prematurely harrowed and lined with the terrible burden of knowing the ways of the evil one, no other casting was possible. The Exorcist was a popular horror masterpiece – but without the unbending, unironic seriousness that Von Sydow brought to it, the film would have had far less impact. In the Von Sydow had a notable black-comic role – a role in which he came as close as he was ever going to come to satirising his own legendary persona – in Woody Allen Hannah and Her Sisters He plays the difficult, misanthropic artist Frederick, whose girlfriend, Lee, played by Barbara Hershey, is being pursued by her sister Hannah husband. “You missed a very boring programme about Auschwitz,” Frederick rumbles at her from in front of the television, when Lee comes in from an evening of forbidden adventure. It is a thoroughly outrageous line, but Von Sydow carries it off with deadpan hauteur that is not quite the same as a gift for comedy (which this actor did not exactly have). It was a year later that Von Sydow starred in the well-regarded, Cannes Palme d’Or-winning Pelle the Conqueror. Playing an older man from Sweden who seeks a new immigrant life in Denmark, he received one of his two Oscar nominations. And it was probably this role that brought Von Sydow into a career phase that he had arguably always been preparing for: the old man. Perhaps the planes and lines of his face were always waiting for age to bring them to their fullest meaning. At any rate, his Oscar nomination for Pelle the Conqueror made more sense that his second nomination for Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, the rather lame fantasy in which Von Sydow was wasted in the silly wise role of an ageing mute. For my money, the greatest of Von Sydow later roles, and one of his greatest ever screen performances, was in Schnabel The Diving Bell and the Butterfly He plays Papinou, a grumpy invalid who irascibly submits to the indignity of being shaved by his middle-aged son – the fashionable magazine editor and man-about-town played by Mathieu Amalric. But then his son suffers a catastrophic stroke and is paralysed by “locked-in syndrome”. The scene in which Von Sydow sobs with grief for his stricken son is a scene that Van Gogh could have pictured.

24,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/02/tracee-ellis-ross-black-ish-as-a-kid-singing-was-too-scary-a-dream,"here is a strange noise coming from Tracee Ellis Ross Los Angeles garden. Hang on, she says, looking away from her computer screen to the window with an alarmed expression. “I’m just going to go check that out. Stand by!” If this were a horror movie, then the stylish woman disappearing into the distance would never come back. But it isn’t a horror movie, it a Zoom interview, and Ross, a Golden Globe-winning actor best known for her role in the US sitcom Black-ish , is talking to me from the sunny living room of her home. Or at least she was; right now, I’m staring at a fiddle-leaf fig tree and a comfortable-looking couch. In a youth-obsessed Hollywood, many women find their careers decline with age, but at Ross appears to be just hitting her stride. The actor, activist and entrepreneur has been in the public eye since her but started getting serious attention only in her early with Black-ish. Now on its sixth season, the show centres on an upper-middle-class African American family, living in a largely white LA neighbourhood, and stars Ross as the matriarch, anaesthetist Rainbow “Bow” Johnson. Its unapologetic handling of race-related issues has turned the comedy into something of a cultural phenomenon . Barack and Michelle Obama are fans; Donald Trump, who tweeted that the show was racism at the highest level, is not . A few minutes after vanishing, Ross slides back in front of her computer and gives the all clear. There is no emergency except, you know, the one we’re all living through. At the time of speaking, LA has been under lockdown for almost a month and, like the rest of us, Ross is still struggling to get to grips with it. “I think we’re all dealing with these waves of emotion where everything seems fine. And then it hits you. It like the fear is just waiting right there.” She gestures towards the window. The fear has not infiltrated her wardrobe. Ross hair is styled into two Princess Leia-like space buns and she wearing a floral, Georgia O’Keeffe -esque top. Even through the awkward interface of a Zoom call, her signature mix of goofiness and glamour comes through – a willingness to poke fun at herself that is a large part of her on-screen appeal. As Black-ish creator Kenya Barris once put it , Ross “can do expressions and physical movement that take a joke from a five to a But if Ross seems down to earth, her childhood was anything but. Her mother is Diana Ross , and her father, Robert Ellis Silberstein, is a successful music executive, who managed the likes of Ronnie Wood and Meat Loaf. As a child, she attended an elite school in Manhattan, and did a stint at the type of Swiss boarding school where a typical gym class means a skiing lesson. She did a photoshoot with Andy Warhol when she was and modelled in her teens. How, I ask, did she avoid turning into a brat? “I’ve always been taught that you work for the things you want,” Ross says. “My mom always joked: ‘I’m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I’ll make sure there a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that…’ I mean, I had a job in high school. I worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren. My mom was like, ‘If you want to keep buying those clothes, you’re going to have to figure out how to pay for them.’ There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life.” Ross speaks fondly of her family, to whom she is extremely close. Her parents split when she was five but remained on good terms, and the childhood she shared with her siblings (four of whom were Diana Ross children, and three of whom were step-siblings from Ross second marriage) sounds happy and wholesome. Being the child of somebody famous might unlock the door, but the people on the other side have their arms crossed “My mom always put us in bed, then she’d go to the recording studio while we were sleeping. She’d sit with us for dinner and she never left for more than a week.” Ross remembers her mother getting the kids to help her make the beds, and she remains a pro at hospital corners. Actually, she says, she still has some of those sheets. “I nicked them out of the closet at home and Mom doesn’t know I have them. They remind me of my childhood.” But being her mother daughter didn’t necessarily help when it came to work. “When I was starting in my career, being the child of somebody famous was not what it is today,” Ross says. “It might unlock the door, but the people sitting on the other side have their arms crossed and are asking: ‘OK, is she as good as her mom?’” She got her first big break as a comic on MTV The Lyricist Lounge Show in The same year, she landed a lead role on the sitcom Girlfriends , which ran for eight seasons, making it the longest-running live-action network sitcom at the time; but its predominantly black cast meant it was always pigeonholed as a “black show”. “The landscape of television was not the same as it is now,” Ross says. “It was still very segregated. We go through waves in this country, around celebrating black narratives: the early were not that time.” Despite the size of Girlfriends’ audience, she didn’t get invited on to the late-night TV shows, or the award shows, or the high-profile industry events. “It wasn’t a matter of how many eyeballs were watching the show,” she says. “It was a matter of which eyeballs were watching.” Then, in Black-ish came along and “everything started to happen”. In she won a Golden Globe for her role, making her the first black woman to pick up the award since (when Debbie Allen won for Fame ). Her proud family had already taken out a full-page ad in the Hollywood Reporter to congratulate her on the nomination. Ross says one of the things that drew her to Black-ish was the way it disrupted conventional narratives. There is a warmth and respect between Bow and her on-screen husband, Andre “Dre” Johnson, that isn’t always evident in sitcoms. “Often the comedy of married couples on television is about how they roll their eyes at each other, how they frustrate each other,” she says. “I’ve never enjoyed that. “There a lot that poked holes in the status quo, particularly as a woman of colour,” she continues. “While the story is told through the eyes of the man, I’m not just the wife. I’m not just a doctor. I’m not just a mom. I’m all of those things. And my point of view is not seen in relation to Dre – it based in my experience and my life.” Sometimes, Ross says, Bow autonomy was “naturally written into the script” and sometimes she pushed for it. “I’m very conscious about not perpetuating stereotypes,” she explains. “In a scene, if they have written that I’m doing ‘lady-chores’ such as the cooking, I’m like: why? It not pivotal to the story. Let Dre do the chopping and I’ll stand here at my computer, or drink a glass of wine, or hold a book. I speak up and I drive them crazy sometimes. But in the context of being a black woman on television, I am very aware of what that imagery says and the stereotypes it perpetuates. My interest is in offering other expressions, other examples, other imagery.” Some of that “other imagery” is the experience of being mixed race, which we don’t always see on mainstream TV. “I had never, ever played that in my career,” Ross says. “Even though [being half black and half Jewish], that what I live.” While her character is clearly mixed race, Black-ish didn’t meaningfully explore that facet of Bow identity. “It ended up being relegated to this space of jokes,” Ross says. “As a mixed person, you’re constantly being bombarded by questions such as, ‘Are you this, or are you that?’ which is the least interesting part of being mixed…” She trails off for a second, losing her thread. “You know when you haven’t been talking a lot?” she says. “It like you lose access to words.” She makes a wide-mouthed, silly face and recovers from Quarantine Voice™ enough to explain how this particular frustration led her to co-create Mixed-ish , a prequel to Black-ish that debuted on ABC last year. While Bow heritage was a comic sidenote in Black-ish, Mixed-ish centres it: Ross narrates the story of Bow childhood, as the daughter of a black mother and white father growing up in America. But there were mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the show politics too simplistic , and it not clear whether it will be back for a second season. Meanwhile, there is one thing Ross has not yet turned her hand to in a long and varied career. She has modelled, given a TED talk (on the power of women fury) and signed up as an ambassador for Time Up . She has appeared in music videos for Drake and Kanye West, a former neighbour . She runs her own company, Pattern , a successful haircare line for people with naturally curly hair. But there is one thing she has spent her entire life petrified of doing: becoming a singer. “I have wanted to sing since I was a kid,” she tells me. “But it was something I buried, because it was too scary a dream.” There was, after all, a lot to live up to. At to go into a studio and discover I had a voice: that was life-changing A year ago she landed a lead role in a movie. Directed by Nisha Ganatra (who worked on Amazon Transparent ), The High Note sees Ross play a superstar singer, Grace Davis, whose career has peaked. Afraid of creating fresh material, Davis keeps trotting out old hits until her assistant (played by Dakota Johnson ) convinces her to record new work. Ross sings six original songs in the film, a dream come true for her. Then, all of a sudden, it was a dream deferred. The High Note was due to premiere in May; in an alternative, coronavirus-free universe, Ross would be crisscrossing the country on a busy promotion schedule. Now, she says, she not sure if a premiere will ever happen. The film will be released, but nobody is quite sure when. A lot of people are dealing with much worse than cancelled movie premieres, she says. “This is a very small disappointment.” But still, it stings. “At years old, to go into the studio and start singing, and discover that I actually had a voice that could work… it was life-changing for me.” Did she really wait until to start? “Pretty much. In high school, I took choir – it was one of the required courses – and we had to perform The Pirates Of Penzance. I was furious. I was so scared of singing in front of people that I marched myself to the headmaster office: ‘Mrs Regalman, I do not think that it fair to force somebody who doesn’t want to sing and who doesn’t want to be on a stage to be on a stage.’ And she told me I had to do it. So I did the play but I just mouthed the words.” Ross sang in public a couple of times after that, but says she would always add “a flare of comedy or hide behind a character”. So it wasn’t until very recently that she decided “to face one of my biggest childhood fears. And, typical me, I didn’t do it small – I decided to do it as the lead in a movie playing a musical diva.” A couple of months ago, Ross unveiled a clip of her singing in the film, during an on-stage interview with Oprah Winfrey . Curled up in her chair in an electric-blue suit, she looked on the verge of tears as the song, called Love Myself, played to a live audience. “I had no memory of getting myself curled up in that chair until I looked over and saw the screen,” she says. She wasn’t the only emotional one: Oprah cried, too, and the audience applauded; Ross has a beautiful voice. On-screen and off, she has spent much of her career challenging established narratives. She is often asked about her unmarried status, and has become a sort of accidental spokeswoman for the joy of being a single, childfree woman. The idea that being a woman means having a husband and kids is so deeply ingrained, she says, that most people don’t even know how inappropriate they’re being when they ask why she not married. Strangers poking around in her uterus used to irritate her, but she doesn’t “mind any more. It no longer stings. It just an opportunity for me to expand somebody idea of the world and add something different. Women, particularly black and brown women, are told we should occupy a smaller area of real estate. Everything in my being and my career is about encouraging women to give themselves permission to take up the space. I am very comfortable making people uncomfortable. Not just for my own wellbeing, but hopefully so that other women don’t have to bear that weight quite as heavily as my generation.” She remains “happily and gloriously single”, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t men in the background. When I ask whether she had texts from exes during lockdown – something of a pandemic phenomenon – she grins. “Oh, that definitely come up,” she says coyly, but won’t go into detail. “I have a heart that is very open and available to find the right man,” she continues. “But, you know, the old expression ‘sweep me off my feet’ seems ridiculous. I want to find a man who will meet me where I am. Because, actually, I like my feet. I like them grounded on the floor.” Our conversation is interrupted by the ping of a text message from a special man in her life. It her dad, wishing her a happy Passover. Ross has been doing regular group calls with her family since lockdown began. “FaceTime with my dad is like this,” she says with a laugh, manoeuvring the computer under her armpit. “I’m like: ‘I can’t see you!’ And he like: ‘I can see you!’ And I’m like: ‘I know , I can’t see you!’” What does she miss most about normal life? “I really miss smelling the people that I love,” Ross says. “Being able to nestle my head in my mom neck, or in my best friend. When I hug my best friend, it a full body hug. And I know what her scent is – not just her perfume, but just what she smells like. I don’t think I realised how important that is.” 'He didn't even pretend to let us win'… Growing up with the world biggest stars, by their children The hardest moments of lockdown, Ross says, seem to be between and It then that the “collective trauma and bizarre nature” of what we’re going through really hits her. “I just want something to distract me and it like, ‘Oh, it just me. Oh hi again! Hey you!’” There has been some solace, she says, in the fiddle-leaf fig she sitting next to. “I’ve been doing a lot of talking to her. She was a little upset to begin with because I forgot to water her for the first few weeks – a lot of leaves started to fall off. But this last week has given me some encouragement that maybe my father green thumb got genetically passed down, after all.” She looks at the plant with a quiet expression of satisfaction. “You know, I think she back to a joyful state.” The High Note will be available to rent at home from May.",2710
25,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/01/gael-garcia-bernal-the-pandemic-has-taught-me-that-i-need-something-to-say,"t the start of the century, the director Alfonso Cuarón was casting Y Tu Mamá También , the bawdy but plangent road movie he had written with his brother Carlos about two oversexed Mexican teenagers, the wealthy Tenoch and his poorer, grungier friend Julio. “Alfonso called me very excitedly,” recalls Carlos Cuarón. “He said: ‘I know who going to play Julio! I’ve seen him in Alejandro movie.’” Alejandro González Iñárritu, that is, whose ferocious dog-fighting drama Amores Perros was about to be released. “I said: ‘No, no, I’ve found Julio; I saw the perfect actor in this short film, De Tripas, Corazón. He incredible: his eyes, the way he manages silence ...’” Eventually, the brothers realised they were talking about the same person: Gael García Bernal, who was then just The son of theatre actors, he had become a star in his early teens on the Mexican soap opera El Abuelo y Yo (Grandpa and I) before decamping to London to study at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Iñárritu plucked him out mid-term for Amores Perros and he stole that movie as the twitchy-hipped tearaway who was every bit as feral as his champion rottweiler. His mutable features could switch from cherubic to lupine to gravely smouldering; his nerve endings felt exposed like frayed electrical wires. “You can feel all his emotions, all his vulnerability,” says Cuarón. “He fills the screen completely. After my wife met him, she said: ‘Wow, he so handsome, but I thought he would be tall.’ He like Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman, the kind of actor whose aura and energy makes you think they’re huge.” In that wham-bam first half-decade of Bernal film career, he gave four killer performances, any one of which would have been enough to build a reputation on: Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También, Pedro Almodóvar Bad Education, part of which he spent looking ravishing in drag, and The Motorcycle Diaries, in which he played a young Che Guevara. Now Bernal has alternated between mainstream projects in the US – such as his five-year stint as an eccentric conductor in the delightful Amazon series Mozart in the Jungle , or his touching voice work as a balladeer trapped in the afterlife in the Disney/ Pixar gem Coco – and politically charged work in Latin America. When he calls me today, it is from Mexico City, one of two locations that is home to him (the other is Buenos Aires) and where he happened to be when the lockdown began. “What beautiful right now in Mexico,” he says brightly, “is that straight after the daily press conference, there are films on TV from the golden age of Mexican cinema, from the to the It been wonderful to watch them in this light. I see the hopes of the actors and film-makers from or years ago. I see their fears, their experiments, what they were trying to build and express. I find it all incredibly moving as a document of humanity.” He thinks the current crisis is altering for ever the way we look at art. “There something more straightforward now in how we see things – it stronger, more elemental and pulsating. We’re so emotionally charged. Artistic expression can affect us for the better, making us feel we’re all in this questioning together.” It is, he suggests, an ideal state in which to approach Ema , his third film with the Chilean director Pablo Larraín, following No , about the plebiscite on Pinochet, and the fantasy-biopic Neruda , in which he played a police inspector who doubts his own existence. Ema is the pair most challenging collaboration, populated largely by destructive and dislikable characters; only gradually do their prickly exteriors peel away to reveal the wounded souls within. Bernal has the small but pivotal role of Gastón, a choreographer married to the dancer Ema ( Mariana Di Girolamo ). He is plainly callous – he taunts her over their recent failed adoption of a seven-year-old boy – but Bernal shows that Gastón is suffering, too. “There is something about the nature of his job that makes him feel very lonely. That was interesting to explore: he the centre of gravity at this dance company, he puts everything together, and that leads to a lot of loneliness. It like directing a film, which is a solitary pursuit even though it collective.” Bernal himself has directed two features – the drama Déficit and the as-yet-unreleased Chicuarotes , about young Mexican hoodlums – as well as founding, with his childhood friend and Y Tu Mamá También co-star Diego Luna, two production companies and a documentary film festival, Ambulante. So could Gastón be a portrait of himself or Larraín? “No, not at all!” he laughs. “But Pablo and I both understand him in his isolation and his stupefaction.” Perhaps, then, he is comparable to Rodrigo, the conductor from Mozart in the Jungle, who is also a restless, demanding creative type? “Yes! Except that Rodrigo represents happiness and adventure, whereas Gastón is the opposite. Rodrigo is Maradona. Gastón is more like Mike Tyson.” His role in Ema is notable for keeping his usual electrifying charm in check; if Gastón is sexual, it is only in the most remote, reptilian way. Such unpalatable parts are rare on Bernal CV. In Fernando Meirelles Blindness , he played an unscrupulous bartender taking advantage of an epidemic that renders its sufferers sightless; in one scene, he performed a head-waggling, bad-taste version of I Just Called to Say I Love You. And in The King, his English-language debut from he was a psychopath calmly wreaking revenge on his long-lost father. “Gael had balls, to be blunt,” says James Marsh, that picture British director. “We went to quite a few up-and-coming young American actors, some of whom have big careers now, and none of them would go near that script. But Gael liked the idea of playing someone with this cold surface. I love way he moves in the film: he always slinking around, more animal than human. The character has pure evil in him, but he played it in this blank way so that you didn’t hate him.” There this incredible ease about Gael. I think he works far harder than one would imagine Saffron Burrows Nor, by the end of Larraín picture, do we hate Gastón. Whether we understand him is another matter, one that Bernal thinks may not be so important. “That always the dilemma, right? Understanding. What the hell does it mean? There is that saying. I think it was Picasso, no? Someone said they didn’t understand his work. So he asked them: ‘You like eating eggs in the morning? You like your huevos rotos ?’ ‘Yeah, I like them.’ ‘OK. But do you understand them?’” He chuckles at that. It is better, he says, for the audience to “know that they don’t know” the character motivations. “That the journey you embark on when you’re building a character. Little by little, the pieces come together. OK, how would this character feel in the rain? What would he do outside? And you start to discover them. Playing Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, there came a point where I could improvise a whole day of his life. I had that ownership of what he would do in any situation. That the nirvana of acting: being able to go into places where you’re not sure what the hell is going to happen.” Saffron Burrows, one of Bernal co-stars on Mozart in the Jungle, witnessed his process up close. “There this incredible ease about Gael,” she tells me. “One thing that was so enjoyable was his improvising, the little riffs he developed, the surprises. Every take was very different. I think he works far harder than one would imagine. Sometimes we’d be doing the same scene for nine hours and I’d see him mulling, working stuff out, honing it.” She and Bernal go way back: they starred together as honeymooners in David Nicholls short play Aftersun , staged at the Old Vic in Burrows even recalls frequenting the bar where he worked while he was a drama student in the late “I used to go bobbing about with friends at this Cuban place in Islington where he was the barman. He had that London training and he always carried this internationalism about him. He very welcoming. When we were making Mozart, he was always at the helm, always being the host.” Although necessarily remote as Gastón, he does get to reveal the character churning inner turmoil during a frantic speech railing against his wife lifestyle. “There are some opinions he has which I share,” Bernal says. “When he mocks the idea of going to Los Angeles and taking selfies, for instance. I would say there is no bigger treason for humankind. It throwing your life away. I know it sounds horrible. But going to Los Angeles and taking selfies serves absolutely no transcendent purpose!” Bernal resisted that city siren call even before he and his former partner, the Argentine actor Dolores Fonzi, had two children: a son, Lázaro, now and a daughter, Libertad, who is nine. He stayed put. “Not because I didn’t want to take selfies! There are just so many stories I wanted to tell. I wanted to change things with my own hands, not follow someone else route.” Marsh thinks that Bernal integrity is vital to his acting. “I have enormous respect for him and how he refused to take the easy path. He could easily have gone to Hollywood and become Antonio Banderas, but he didn’t. He stretched himself and matured into a great artist.” Cuarón, who went on to direct Bernal and Luna in the football saga Rudo y Cursi, agrees. “Gael and Diego are the most respected actors of their generation in Mexico. He involved with social issues like immigration, and he very outspoken politically. He is both criticised and celebrated, depending on who is in government here. And though he has lived everywhere, he has never left Mexico or stopped being involved in Mexican issues.” Even noble, conscientious actors are only human. Has he ever taken any roles purely for the money? “Oh, there have been one or two,” the actor says ruefully. I invite him to name and shame them, but he declines with a giggle: “Noooo!” So let just say it is oddly comforting that even a performer as good as he is can still make films as poor as Letters to Juliet , where he played Amanda Seyfried insufferable boyfriend, or A Little Bit of Heaven , in which he was an oncologist who falls for Kate Hudson as she dies photogenically and at great length. “I did certain projects I wasn’t too sure of,” he admits. “Sometimes there would be a pleasant surprise, sometimes a very bad one where I’d think: ‘It not worth it, man. What am I doing?’ If this pandemic has made me learn one thing, it is that I have to work less. I need to nurture and have something to say.” So he not going to do another film he doesn’t believe in? “I think so, yeah. It a commonplace thing to say. But now, thanks to this situation, it even more acute, right? I’m just going to do what I like. I’m going to be stricter about that from now on.” Ema is available on free preview on May, and then normally on Mubi from May",1914
26,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/09/streaming-the-joy-of-romcoms-romantic-comedy-elizabeth-sankey,"omantic comedies are a perennially undervalued genre: even very fine ones are often described as “guilty pleasures”. That always a nonsense term, given that no pleasure is without value or grace – least of all these days. Under lockdown, don’t you find yourself more inclined towards romantic comedies both great and mediocre, to sink yourself in the familiar warmth of stories driven by love and tenderness, where everything tends to turn out fine? Mubi has thus chosen an opportune moment to premiere Romantic Comedy , a spry, affectionate documentary by musician turned film-maker Elizabeth Sankey that gives this maligned genre its due. A short, accessible film essay that did the festival rounds last year, it cuts to the heart of why romcoms have to work harder to be taken seriously – hint: they tend to prioritise the female viewer – and unpicks their history of flawed gender politics and heteronormative bias. But it a loving exercise, overlaid with droll personal commentary, and one that will have you jotting down a playlist of films to watch right after. Barbara Stanwyck zesty partnership with Henry Fonda is the opposites-attract dynamic to beat them all To look at many streaming platforms, you’d be forgiven for thinking barely any romcoms existed before the Thanks to agreeable recent confections such as Set It Up and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before , Netflix may be the name credited with reviving popular interest in the genre, but its selection of romcoms it hasn’t made is a bit on the lean side. It does offer two cast-iron modern classics in When Harry Met Sally and Groundhog Day , plus the ever-underrated delights of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock sparky chemistry in Two Weeks Notice , the bright, snappy Think Like a Man , and Steve Martin gently daffy Cyrano de Bergerac reworking Roxanne . But for more vintage or unusual pleasures, you’ll need to hunt elsewhere. You can count on the BFI Player to class things up a bit, starting with Smiles of a Summer Night by Ingmar Bergman: certainly not the first name you’d associate with romantic comedies, but this witty roundelay of midsummer desires proved he could twinkle with the best of them. Eric Rohmer cornered the market in bittersweet arthouse romantic comedy, and two lovely examples are here. Pauline at the Beach is feathery and melancholy at once, as it probes a teenage girl first foray into adult holiday romance, but The Green Ray is transcendent, following with aching wit and compassion the fits and starts of a single woman quest to find companionship over the course of one long, hot summer. It accompanied by an introduction from our own Mark Kermode, who also paid his respects to the genre in a dedicated episode of his Secrets of Cinema series on the BBC iPlayer – neat complementary viewing to Sankey film. If you fancy the peerless romantic comedies of Hollywood golden age, Amazon Prime has a genuine buried treasure in Gregory La Cava jewel My Man Godfrey , which tends to get less canonised than screwball peers such as The Philadelphia Story ( on Amazon too , and still a perfect sponge cake of a movie). But it effortlessly fast, diamond-sharp stuff, wringing slightly barbed laughs from its upstairs-downstairs premise before rosy feelings win out. Over at iTunes, you can find perhaps my all-time favourite romantic comedy, The Lady Eve , the gleaming zenith of Preston Sturges considerable career. Barbara Stanwyck was born to deliver his lickety-split dialogue, and her zesty partnership with Henry Fonda nebbishy ophiologist is the opposites-attract dynamic to beat them all. If your romcom tastes veer less traditional, meanwhile, there something out there for you, be it the erotically charged clash of heat, hormones and ham in Bigas Luna Jamón Jamón (Amazon); the smart feminism of Obvious Child (iTunes), with abortion as its daring romantic starting point; Harold and Maude riotous, still-subversive reversal of a conventional May-December age gap (Amazon Prime); or Nicole Holofcener Enough Said (Chili), whose everyday love story between two middle-aged divorcees (exquisitely played by James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is special for its very ordinariness. There are as many flavours of romcom out there as there are of romance: shed the guilt, keep the pleasure.

27,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/best-film-21st-century-there-will-be-blood-paul-thomas-anderson-daniel-day-lewis-oil,"he title is a prophecy, a warning, or a vengeful supernatural pronouncement. Paul Thomas Anderson strange masterpiece , freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair novel Oil!, is a tragic parable of man dependence on this commodity: formerly the lubricant of commercial triumph and technological innovation, and now the dwindling lifeblood of our material prosperity, the unacknowledged driving force of our military conflicts, and even the cause of a coming ecological catastrophe. That dark title threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview. 'An account of how insane we once were' – Paul Thomas Anderson on There Will Be Blood Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure and serves only to amplify the loneliness, paranoia and resentment that were there from the very beginning. Day-Lewis seems to have unlocked this character mystery by seizing on a voice: a robust, cantankerous Scots-Irish accent that he has modified from John Huston (a borrowing that itself may have a subtextual reminder of Huston directing The Treasure of the Sierra Madre). As a poor man, Plainview is seen hacking fanatically away in a silver mine, to the accompaniment of an eerie, atonal score by Radiohead Jonny Greenwood : he accidentally discovers oil, like the apes at the beginning of Kubrick discovering their opposable thumbs. The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than when it was released in Since then, Day-Lewis has given more emollient and sympathetic performances: as Abraham Lincoln for Spielberg in and as the fictional English couturier Reynolds Woodcock for Paul Thomas Anderson Phantom Thread in Compared with either, Plainview is uncompromising and uningratiating, and it is a grandiloquent performance that could be expected of no one else. Perhaps not Olivier in his screen heyday would have tried something so melodramatically strange – and yes, the weird “milkshake” monologue at the end now feels a bit exposed. No one other than Day-Lewis could have carried it off. The film is also intensely, disconcertingly male, a story of male toxicity without any real female dimension. As a rich man, Plainview is marooned in a huge, dark mausoleum of a house, boasting with black-comic savagery that he will suck up every competitor oil like a milkshake. This scene, along with one showing Plainview theatrically driving a stake through a claim map in front of investors, is perhaps there to make us think of Welles Charles Kane , the entrepreneur as performative capitalist, bully and showoff. Like Kane, Plainview is a man whose distinction resides in not having something extra but something missing, a gap where his heart should be, a spiritual imbalance generating neurotic, self-destructive energy. From there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump It could also be that Anderson was inspired by Nicolas Roeg underrated movie Eureka from based on a true story, with Gene Hackman as the super-rich Arctic prospector Jack McCann, who was eventually to face loneliness and a grisly death. There Will Be Blood may itself have been an influence on The Social Network , directed by David Fincher, in which Jesse Eisenberg Mark Zuckerberg is driven by resentment and rage to create the social media world that now rules our lives. But from there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview deranged “milkshake” pronouncement.

28,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/how-insane-we-once-were-paul-thomas-anderson-there-will-be-blood,"Do you think it the best film of the century so far? Who am I to argue? I’ll take it. It bragging rights for sure and I don’t take it lightly. But, of course, I could rattle off a long list of great films from this century … that isn’t hard to do. Is there a competition in you to care about such things? I suppose if it was second-best film of the century my first question would have been, “What No It very possible by the end of this year it could slip off the list entirely. Is it the same film you would make today? Do you rewatch it? I haven’t seen it in a number of years, but last I saw it I was very proud and satisfied. It was the first time I’d seen it where I had forgotten exactly what was going to happen next – and that was a wonderful experience. Having made something, it very hard to get back to that sense of discovery. Everything really seems to fit together about it – the performances, the music, the landscape and the story, all the strands within the larger film, especially the theme of father and son – all work in unison. It also very robust, which I like. I know, as I think we all do, that what makes it really great is Daniel Day-Lewis . Which moment or line makes you laugh most? Everything Daniel does makes me giggle with pleasure and joy. His inventiveness, his devilishness, the joy he has in making such a maniacal portrait of a man unhinged. He has a great chemistry with Paul Dano. Do you place more faith in capitalism or religion? Well … I’m kind of equal opportunity confused and rooting for the best sides of both. Do you get sick of the milkshake memes ? Nah. Too much is never enough. Do you think the film feels like a yet more urgent prophecy today? Of bleeding the Earth dry, of allowing greed to triumph over human relations? Unfortunately, this story doesn’t seem to be going out of style any time soon. It would be nice to see it as science fiction one day. Or an account of how truly insane we all once were. Donald Trump recently declined to quote any Bible verse he likes. Are there any the film refers to you think may speak to him specifically? Might The Art of the Deal make for an alternative title to There Will Be Blood? I like all the quotes in the Bible, Old and New Testament, and y’know, it very private, I’m not gonna get into it … [ WEARY FACE EMOJI ] I can’t quote the Bible from off the top of my head, I have to go rummage around like everyone else. Or, as Plainview says: “I like all religions. I like them all. I don’t belong to one church in particular.”",491

It an autobiographical documentary, Folman interviewing the men he fought alongside, aged in the first Lebanon war of He has repressed his memories of the time. The film climax is the massacre of Palestinian refugees by Christian Phalangists at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps . CC Read the review Capernaum A sprawling drama that functions both as an excoriating treatise on the nature of poverty in Lebanon, and an idiosyncratic drama in which a child takes his parents to court for their ill-treatment of him. We tend to think of the latter type of juvenile emancipation as the province of overprivileged westerners, but director Nadine Labaki makes it work in the toughest of social circumstances: a living in the Beirut slums, takes steps to deal with his parents’ neglect. A highly original and affecting film. AP Read the review Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy Such was the glut of Judd Apatow-ish comedies to come our way about years ago that it easy to forget what a gem this is; how deep and weird the performances (stand up, Steve Carell), how fast the laughs and rich the detail.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger star as the farmhands whose love survives marriages, years of separation – and even death. CS Read the review Happy as Lazzaro A beautiful, strange dream of a film, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher drama looks at first as if it set sometime in the dim and distant, a portrait of villagers exploited by feudal oppression. But no, there a mobile phone. OK, a flip-phone, but this is modern rural Italy. Well, the first half, anyway. After that, it complicated, with a flight into magic realism or perhaps even reincarnation. CC Read the review The Incredibles The Guardian Peter Bradshaw ranked The Incredibles as Pixar best ever film, the jewel in the crown. And only Pixar could make a superhero movie for kids about a midlife crisis. Mr Incredible is living in suburbia with his family after one lawsuit too many. Edna Mode, fashion designer to the supers, is an utter delight: “This is a hobo suit, dahlin, you can’t be seen in it!” CC Read the review We Need to Talk about Kevin Lynne Ramsay didn’t soften the blows adapting Lionel Shriver bestselling novel about a Columbine-style high-school massacre. A what-if feminist parable, this is a movie that thinks the unthinkable: what if a mother doesn’t like her child, or even love him? And the casting is killer, with Ezra Miller as Kevin and Tilda Swinton playing the mother. It a bruising watch, but Ramsay makes it impossible to turn away. CC Read the review Waiting for Happiness Malian director Abderrahmane Sissako won a lot of admirers for this slow-burn study of life in a west African town. Returning to Mauritania, his country of birth, Sissako puts together a string of vignettes and encounters, linked together by a returning, westernised student who can barely remember the local language. AP Read the review The Souvenir Joanna Hogg belated international breakthrough is a story of extraordinary specificity – young Hogg has disastrous affair while living in Knightsbridge and studying as a film student in the early – with rare cut-through and relatability. Honor Swinton Byrne is astonishing in her first film; Tom Burke inch-perfect as the charming but parasitic older man. CS Read the review Ted Seth MacFarlane brief ascent to the Hollywood firmament was down to this scabrously funny talking-bear farce, which helped reinvent the grossout comedy. Mark Wahlberg is great as the straight man to the foul-mouthed toy of the title, with Mila Kunis as his censorious fiancee. MacFarlane creation was simultaneously endearing and outrageous. AP Read the review Gangs of Wasseypur Mammoth two-part Indian crime film that a long, long way from Bollywood. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, this is conceived on a giant scale, as generations of three gangster families fight for supremacy over the course of half a century. Stylish, visceral film-making, violent and hard-hitting, it got a valid claim to be India answer to The Godfather. AP Read the review Wuthering Heights Andrea Arnold tossed out the costume drama rulebook with her raw, passionate retelling of Emily Brontë novel. I’d argue the case for Wuthering Heights as one of the most criminally underrated movies of recent years – though it been influential, blazing a trail for stripped-back period movies such as Lady Macbeth . Arnold was an early adopter of inclusive casting, too, giving the role of Heathcliff to black actor James Howson. CC Read the review Leave No Trace It took Winter Bone Debra Granik eight years to get this off the ground, but was worth the wait: a brilliantly moving eco drama with Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie as a father and daughter living off grid in an Oregon forest, but whose relationship and priorities are changed as the child begins the transition to adulthood. AP Read the review Behind the Candelabra Relegated to telly in the US, Steven Soderbergh wondrously funny and lavish Liberace biopic had a cinema release in the UK. Michael Douglas cast vanity aside and caution to the wind with virtuosic results as the promiscuous ivories-tickler; Matt Damon was terrific against type as his lover, Rob Lowe pinched and uproarious as their much-employed cosmetic surgeon. CS Read the review Russian Ark Groundbreaking single-shot paean to the Winter Palace in St Petersburg from Russian director Alexander Sokurov. Exploiting then newly developed video technology, Sokurov crafted an elaborately choreographed procession of tableaux and set pieces that explored three centuries of Russian history and culture, from the imperial era to the wartime siege of Leningrad. AP Read the review The Social Network After the Cambridge Analytica revelations , the treachery and backstabbery in Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher Facebook origin tale looks positively quaint – the geeks and nerds fighting over who had the idea for Facebook first. Nevertheless, this is still an outrageously watchable hatchet job. Jesse Eisenberg is a knockout Mark Zuckerberg, the smartest guy in the room (though not sartorially, in flip-flops and a hoodie). CC Read the review Fire at Sea A beautifully shot observational documentary about the continuing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean: the lethally dangerous boats that carry refugees from Africa and end up on the Italian island of Lampedusa . Shot by director Gianfranco Rosi with an evocative lyricism that sits in counterpoint to the blazing anger at the film heart. AP Read the review Amores Perros A film that grabs you by the neck and shakes hard, this brutal crime drama announced the Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu as a major new talent in (And lumbered him for the while with the label “Mexico Tarantino”.) A film of mayhem and fury, three stories intersect around a car crash in which one of the passengers is a champion fighting dog. CC Read the review Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Western audiences unfamiliar with the wuxia martial arts genre had never seen anything like Ang Lee dazzling epic in – fighters flying through the air with balletic grace. In the most exhilarating scene, the daughter of a regional governor (Ziyi Zhang) goes sword-to-sword with a famous warrior (Chow Yun-fat) in the branches of bamboo trees swaying high above the ground. CC Read the review Before Sunset In Richard Linklater gorgeous, romantic Before Sunrise , a pair of twentysomethings (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) spent the day together in Vienna. Here in the second movie when they meet again in Paris for another brief encounter, they are in their So the questions are for grownups. Am I with the right person? Where did my life go? It also has the best line ever about being in a couple with small children: “I feel like I’m running a small nursery with someone I used to date.” CC Read the review Hour Party People Michael Winterbottom and Steve Coogan truth-tickling hit a high note with this joyful sorta-biopic of the record label boss and broadcaster Tony Wilson. Playful, ingenious and prodigiously informative, it a triumph of vision over verite. It also a total blast. CS Read the review The House of Mirth Terence Davies utilised Gillian Anderson poised elegance to good advantage in this brilliantly controlled adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel. Anderson plays Lily Bart, the woman whose reputation and standing are gradually sullied until she becomes an unmarriageable outcast in end of America. AP Read the review Margaret Here another dark American tale from Manchester by the Sea writer-director Kenneth Lonergan (Margaret was completed in but only released in after a wrangle with the studio). Set in post New York, Anna Paquin is an overentitled teenager partly responsible for a tragic accident. As in Manchester by the Sea, the effect is shattering; it is like watching actual lives fall apart. CC Read the review Volver Arguably Penélope Cruz finest performance, in one of Pedro Almodóvar key films: a heady stew of murder, family strife and supernatural shenanigans. Cruz plays a woman forced to kill and bury her ex-husband, while her dead mother appears to be haunting her hairdresser sister. All is resolved after various traumas are lanced. AP Read the review Intense, anger-driven documentary from Ava DuVernay on the racialisation of the US justice system, positing the idea that the massively disproportionate incarceration of African-American men is simply slavery by another name. With a title referring to the constitutional amendment that abolished slavery, DuVernay suggests that privatised prisons, cheap labour and light-touch capitalism are all in it together. Tough stuff. AP Read the review Toni Erdmann A knockout blow for the lazy, patronising stereotype that Germans don’t have a sense of humour, Maren Ade Toni Erdmann is one of the funniest films to hit (arthouse) cinemas in years. It the story of a workaholic management consultant (Sandra Hüller) whose embarrassing dad turns up unannounced for the weekend wearing joke-shop false teeth. A genuine one-off, the film is partly a satire on Europe, globalisation and workplace misogyny, as well as being a prickly sweet father-daughter movie. CC Read the review The Wolf of Wall Street Possibly the most fun anyone had at the cinema so far this century, Martin Scorsese The Wolf of Wall Street ought to be a cautionary tale. It based on the autobiography of crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort, convicted in for fraud and money-laundering. But why focus on regret, when there are hookers, drugs and fast cars? Leonardo DiCaprio is outrageously entertaining as Belfort. CC Read the review Months, Weeks and Days The film whose Palme d’Or win heralded the arrival of a new wave of Romanian cinema. A young woman, helped by her friend, arranges an illegal abortion in the late the squalid events that follow parallel the decay and chaos of the country as the communist dictatorship began to collapse. Harrowing but clear-sighted. AP Read the review The Handmaiden The Handmaiden is one of cinema great literary adaptations: Park Chan-wook transposes Sarah Waters crime novel Fingersmith from Victorian London to Korea in the In this most twisted of love stories, a pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) poses as maid to a wealthy heiress (Kim Min-hee). But who is the double-crosser? Depending on your tastes, a candidate for sexiest film of the century. CC Read the review Unrelated At the age of after a career directing TV soaps such as Casualty and EastEnders, Joanna Hogg reinvented herself as auteur of a new breed of cinema. In her feature debut, Unrelated, Kathryn Worth played a fortyish woman holidaying in Tuscany with two dysfunctional families and flirting outrageously with one of the lads (Tom Hiddleston in his first movie). A cinema of awkwardness, wielding a scalpel on the well-to-do middle classes, was born. CC Read the review Meek Cutoff Kelly Reichardt is a master of slow cinema, the maker of films about American outsiders, living without a safety net. Meek Cutoff is a western set in Oregon, following three families on the wagon train west. Their leader is show-offy Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood), but Reichardt focus, as is customary for her, is on the women – a trio played by Michelle Williams, Zoe Kazan and Shirley Henderson. CC Read the review Once Upon a Time in Anatolia Here a police procedural with a difference by the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan – the whodunnit and why playing second fiddle to long stretches of silence. It set in rural Turkey where officials are spending the night driving a murder suspect around looking for a body. What they find, however, is mostly existential despair. Not exactly easy viewing, but it a masterpiece of slow cinema. CC Read the review Dogville Lars von Trier’ s Brechtian parable about coercive capitalism remains arguably the Danish provocateur masterpiece. Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany both excel in this study of a woman on the run from gangsters who is offered shelter in a small town in return for undertaking chores. Von Trier use of stylised, floor-painted sets is the inspired final touch. AP Read the review A Separation The film begins with a couple in front of a judge asking for a divorce. She wants to leave Iran and take their daughter. He cannot go; his elderly father is sick. Everyone behaves badly in Asghar Farhadi desperately painful family drama. Farhadi superpower is empathy, making the audience see all points of view. He lays depth charges in seemingly inconsequential moments with emotionally thrilling consequences. CC Read the review Years British director Andrew Haigh quietly devastating drama is a deeply moving portrait of marriage with the shiver of a ghost story. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay play a Norfolk couple planning their wedding anniversary. A week before the party, a letter lands on their doormat like a hand grenade with news of his early lost love. Rampling is sensational. CC Read the review The Child (L’Enfant , The Dardenne brothers’ second Palme d’Or was bestowed on this stark portrait of underclass desperation, filmed in their characteristic hyper-naturalist manner. Jérémie Renier plays a petty criminal who sells his newborn baby in the adoption black market, but his devastated girlfriend response forces a kind of redemption. AP Read the review The Royal Tenenbaums Probably most Wes Anderson-y of Wes Anderson films and certainly his finest, with a to-die-for cast and the best fur coat in the history of cinema. Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller are the Tenenbaum siblings, all former child prodigies. The brilliance has faded. Who to blame? Enter paterfamilias Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), a man who consoles his grieving grandsons with: “I’m sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.” CC Read the review Gravity If we are living through a golden age of space movies, here where it started, Alfonso Cuarón spectacular thriller, shot with unbearable tension and Discovery Channel realism. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with George Clooney by her side, a living, breathing Buzz Lightyear. When a storm of debris hits the pair, a terrifying fight for survival ensues. Astoundingly good. CC Read the review Anomalisa Charlie Kaufman existential breakdown with stop-motion puppets is a miniature masterpiece of concept and execution. David Thewlis voices the depressed motivational speaker to whom everyone sounds the same – except for Jennifer Jason Leigh scarred sales agent. “What is it to be human?” asks Michael Stone (Thewlis). “To ache?” Few films try to answer: this Fabergé egg of a film does. CS Read the review Leviathan The hardest-drinking movie on our list - with some stiff competition - Andrey Zvyagintsev anti-Putin polemic is brilliant, ballsy and completely sozzled. Our hero fisherman is forced from his home so that the corrupt local mayor can build his own palace on the site. A priest speaks of “reawakening the soul of the Russian people” as their spirits lie crushed at his feet. Corruption is so endemic, these people have even lost God. This is the most almighty achievement. CS Read the review Nebraska Bruce Dern discards his marbles on a windmill-tilting road trip with loving but frustrated son Will Forte. Alexander Payne black-and-white ode to small-town America is his best this century ( Sideways has not aged like a fine wine). It also features June Squibb being completely filthy. CS Read the review The Tree of Life Terrence Malick return to cinema six years after The New World has been vaguely tainted by the slew of woozy filmic xeroxes that have followed, but his first comeback – in which Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain stand in for his parents in Texas – is a choking knockout. CS Read the review The Grand Budapest Hotel Just nudging Gene Hackman Tenenbaum clan down the list, Wes Anderson glorious confection is a delight with a hard nugget of politics at its core. Ralph Fiennes central turn as charming concierge M Gustave, all beneficent sex and abashed camp, remains the man finest hour. CS Read the review A One and a Two (Yi Yi , Edward Yang final film is a delicate domestic miracle: the story of one family seen through the perspectives of the father, the son and the daughter. A wedding begins proceedings, a funeral ends them. The stuff in the middle is the everyday, dissected with rare beauty and gravity. CS Read the review Get Out Jordan Peele debut is a perfect, hard-polished gem of a film. A race satire that skewers beautifully, it also a chilling comedy, a proper horror and minutes of complete entertainment. CS Read the review Ida Brief as a dream and just as devastating, Paweł Pawlikowski black and white story of a novice nun on a road trip with her aunt in Poland to discover the fate of her Jewish parents is spare, shocking and utterly unforgettable. CS Read the review Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan Still Sacha Baron Cohen finest moment, a feature-length upscaling of his ludicrously hilarious TV character, whose purpose is to sucker the unsuspecting into condemning themselves out of their own mouths. Borat is on a trip in the US to try to marry Pamela Anderson; not everything works, but when it does it astounding: cruelly revelatory and hysterically funny at the same time. AP Read the review Spirited Away Hayao Miyazaki wondrous animation, the greatest success of a spectacular run from Japan Studio Ghibli. A gentle, mysterious fable about a girl whose family stumble upon a haunted bathhouse. After her parents are turned into pigs, she works to lift the curse, encountering a variety of spirit-world beings along the way. AP Read the review The White Ribbon Michael Haneke won his first Palme d’Or with this chilling, steel-hard parable set in Germany just before the first world war. The inhabitants of a small village are dogged by mysterious, violent incidents that serve mostly to exacerbate the dysfunctional social codes they all live by – and elliptically suggests the moral climate that evolved into Nazism. AP Read the review Roma Despite lingering controversy over its adoption by Netflix in its war with the film industry, Roma still stands as an absolutely major work. Mexican auteur Alfonso Cuarón returned to the Mexico City of his childhood, telling the story of a middle-class family and their nanny-cum-maid in swooning, lyrical black and white. Part memoir, part elegaic fiction, Cuaron hit the heights with this. AP Read the review Lincoln Steven Spielberg portrait of the great US president looked at the time like a history lesson come to life: graced by a monumental, Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis , it detailed the arm-twisting and chicanery behind the passing of his slave-freeing constitutional amendment. These days, it looks like a fantasy: a president with principles: who’d have thought? AP Read the review A Serious Man The Coen brothers don’t really do personal, but this is as close as they’ve got (so far). Set in their home town of Minneapolis in the late A Serious Man stars Michael Stuhlbarg as an academic whose life is roiled by continuing uncertainty and self-doubt – triggering repeat visits to his rabbis, a marriage breakdown and extended interactions with his oddball brother. AP Read the review The Great Beauty The Young Pope director Paolo Sorrentino crafted this swooningly beautiful love letter to Rome – “la grande bellezza” – in its decadent, jaded glory. Toni Servillo, Sorrentino regular onscreen foil, plays journalist Jep Gambardella, a bon viveur beginning to sense the dying of his personal light, and hunting out meaning and substance in the world around him. AP Read the review The Act of Killing An extraordinary documentary about the wave of barbaric killings that swept Indonesia in the Orchestrated by director Joshua Oppenheimer, this film revisits the perpetrators of some horrific events and asks them – with little need for encouragement – to re-enact them. The result is almost unwatchable: the murderers’ glee at performing, and the remorse they may or may not experience as a result. AP Read the review Shoplifters Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d’Or for this exquisitely turned drama that – like much of Kore-eda previous output – explores what it is to be a family in entirely non-conventional circumstances. A shoplifting gang take in a young girl who seems abandoned; how they hang together – or not – is the film key theme. AP Read the review White Material One of Isabelle Huppert finest performances, and that saying something. Director Claire Denis drew on her own upbringing in colonial west Africa to give this study of a hard-as-nails plantation owner a pungent whiff of authenticity. Huppert is Maria, obsessed with getting in the coffee harvest as a violent civil conflict moves ever closer. Saddled with an untrustworthy husband and an erratic son, it all she can do to survive. AP Read the review Far From Heaven From director Todd Haynes, this is pastiche at its most brilliantly acute. Haynes takes the bold, vivid melodrama beloved of Douglas Sirk, and reconfigures it to fully reveal the social faultlines of race, sex and class that were considerably more latent in the original. A beautifully crafted act of ancestor worship. AP Read the review Son of Saul Brutally visceral fable that plunges the viewer headlong into the all-encompassing horror of a Nazi extermination camp. Shot in remorseless, unforgiving close-up by first time Hungarian director László Nemes, the story of a Jewish prison-camp worker whose job it is to help clear the gas chamber of corpses is cinema at its absolute rawest. AP Read the review Mulholland Drive A magisterial achievement from David Lynch, despite the difficulties he had getting it off the ground. Originally conceived as the pilot of a new TV series, this expertly fuses Lynch softcore pulp obsessions with his trademark creepy surrealism. Naomi Watts was the big discovery here: she plays a wannabe actor who midway seems to switch personalities with another, more jaded one. AP Read the review Team America: World Police The most audacious slaughter of sacred cows seen on celluloid, Matt Stone and Trey Parker marionette action-musical is a gleeful hail of precision-aimed bullets. It totally fearless: pops are taken at Hollywood, Broadway, evil dictators, gung-ho superpowers, the intelligence service, bleeding heart liberals, actors – especially actors – before signing off with a devastating, if obscene, defence of US interventionism. Politically, it scattergun; satirically, it spot-on. Mostly, though, it just ferociously funny, even if most of the humour does, finally, come from the sight of the puppets tottering around, getting drunk, having wild sex, attempting to walk through doorways and wrestling panthers played by kittens. CS Read the review Zama An official working for the Spanish crown descends into madness while waiting for a transfer out of his backwater post in Paraguay in Lucrecia Martel fevered historical drama. Like a disorienting dream, it a film of fragments, moments that worm their way into your memory – a slave limping with flayed feet, a llama barging into frame during an uncomfortable meeting. Daniel Giménez Cacho is petty, wretched Zama, clinging to his white man sense of importance (and his ill-fitting periwig), a symptom of colonial rot. Martel has been called “the Malick of Latin American cinema” but this feels closer to Herzog. A strange masterpiece. CC Read the review Moonlight The triumph of Barry Jenkins coming-of-age tale over La La Land for the best picture Oscar was extraordinary in all sorts of ways, of which Faye Dunaway envelope mixup was maybe the least remarkable. It was the first film with an all-black cast as well as with an LGBTQ theme to scoop the prize – and it must also rank as one of the most visually and tonally ambitious: told in three parts, with three different leads, each showing the stages of repression and internalised loathing in the young life of a Miami man. It simply revelatory: innovative, wildly affecting, utterly beautiful. CS Read the review Synecdoche, New York After a string of brilliant, industry-transforming scripts, Charlie Kaufman made his directorial debut with this complex, convoluted drama, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as theatre director Caden Cotard, who is swamped by personal crises as he works on his dream project: building an ever-expanding replica of the city streets and buildings inside a giant warehouse, and populating it with lookalikes; the blurred boundary between performance and reality is mirrored in Cotard own breakdown, with the title giving the big clue – this is all symbolic. AP Read the review Hidden Having made his name as one of the pioneers of ordeal arthouse with unflinching chronicles of trauma and cruelty, Austrian auteur Michael Haneke achieved a unlikely popular success with this film that connected with France deep well of unease about events of the relatively recent past. Daniel Auteuil plays a successful TV host whose contentment is disturbed by the arrival of mysterious surveillance tapes. This seems to be connected with a young Algerian boy whose parents were apparently killed in the infamous Paris massacre . Haneke ratchets up the tension with an unerring sense of dread and dismay. AP Read the review In the Mood for Love Has there ever been a more beautiful couple in the history of cinema than Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in Wong Kar-Wai smouldering love story In the Mood for Love? Not that they’re a couple, technically. It Chow (Tony Leung) and Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next door to each other in a cramped Hong Kong block of flats. His wife is having an affair – with her husband. The cheated-on pair become friends, but vow not to behave badly. Like Brief Encounter, the film aches with the understanding that impossible love makes for a more romantic movie. It gorgeously detailed, drenched in sensuality – a scene in which the two squeeze past each other in a narrow alleyway by night has a humid sexiness. CC Read the review Under the Skin Jonathan Glazer first film in nearly a decade (and still his most recent) turned out to be an uncategorisable masterwork. Scarlett Johansson plays an alien in human form, trawling the streets of Glasgow for unsuspecting males to “take home” – in fact, using them as a food source. From its unnerving alien-POV sequences, to the empathetic scene with actor Adam Pearson (who has neurofibromatosis ), to the sheer coldness of the predatory logic of its central figure, Under the Skin achieves a mood and texture unlike anything else before or since. AP Read the review Boyhood Twelve years in the shooting, Richard Linklater story of a child life between six and is a vindication of artistic ambition in an age of cinematic snacking. Its downside is to ruin almost every single other film for you – at least all those in which the actors are conspicuously aged up or down. In watching the bonafide progress of Ellar Coltrane – as well as Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as his parents – Boyhood provides its audience with an intimacy and an investment like no other. This is cinema as gentle revolution. CS Read the review Years a Slave Steve McQueen real-life story of Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana, exudes all of the dignity, impatience and artistic fidelity of its director. It is perfectly cast and paced, endlessly surprising, uncompromising and compassionate: a story purely and powefully told, yet full of the extraordinary visual grace notes. It never descends into cliche or even self-pity; it remains a film for adults, uninterested in anything but the truth. To read Northup memoir is to be astonished by the film fidelity. CS Read the review There Will Be Blood Paul Thomas Anderson strange masterpiece, freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair novel Oil!, has a dark title that threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure. The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than it did in when it first came out. But from there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview deranged “milkshake” pronouncement. What a spectacle Anderson and Day-Lewis create: a portrait of male belligerence and fear, a Tutankhamun of misery, walled up in his own sarcophagus of wealth and prestige.

Thinking of it gives me the same feeling I had when the credits rolled on my first viewing of it over a decade ago. (I wonder how many other films on this list were in competition at the Cannes? What an astounding year for cinema.) Andrew Haigh Uzak It is a gentle and profoundly compassionate film, one of the best about loneliness ever made. I think about it all the time. Hirokazu Kore-eda Secret Sunshine Lee Chang-dong deep insight into human nature is reflected in the film. Joanna Hogg Margaret An epic story about a New York teenager facing a complex moral dilemma in the shadow of It told in a multi-faceted way that refuses to simplify or obey an overarching story, which only enhances the emotional veracity. I believe we respond to films subjectively - how, when and what mood we’re in when we watch a film - has to be taken into account when we pass judgement on a film. I saw Margaret projected in perfect conditions with an open mind and heart one night in at The Rex Berkhamsted - and was completely carried away by it. All too soon watching a film like Margaret in a beautiful cinema will be an experience of the past. We must do what we can to keep cinemas alive. Mike Leigh The Death of Mr Lazarescu Exemplary low-budget masterpiece about a sick old guy being carted from hospital to hospital in the middle of the night. Honest. Direct. Real. Moving. Comic. Tragic. Richard Linklater The Tree of Life For its vast ambition and meditative grace. It somehow manages to be both an intimate memory film while taking on the notion of all of existence. And I love the way it confounds and challenges perception itself. Kenneth Lonergan Talk to Her The best of anything is impossible to identify, but the movie that keeps coming to my mind is Pedro Almodovar Talk To Her. How does he move so freely through this story? How does he attach these strange and loving characters to each other, to the music and the dance performances, to Sleeping Beauty, silent film, loneliness, innocence, fetishism, and the colour red? Lucrecia Martel Familia Sumergida (A Family Submerged) Because it reveals eternal life in family conversations. Steve McQueen Café Lumière A film that happens without you knowing. Joshua Oppenheimer I just can’t bring myself to name one film over all others. Can I spread the love and offer these: Code Unknown Dogtooth Happy as Lazzaro Import/Export Nobody Knows I’m so sorry – I have little practice at naming favourites. László Nemes Meek Cutoff I saw Meek Cutoff in Paris when I was writing my first feature film, in Traditional cinema projection was already dying, but this film was screened in and it was beautiful and hypnotic. I remember the profound impression this film made on me, with its maze-like experience, the humanistic point of view, the small scale against the huge western backdrop, the unanswered questions about humanity, savagery and civilisation. For me, this film is what cinema can achieve, even after the age of the “Masters” (but certainly influenced by it) - take the viewer on a journey that they can be a part of. Trey Parker and Matt Stone Mad Max: Fury Road We love everything George Miller has ever done and Fury Road will be his crowning achievement until, maybe, his next film comes out. Pawel Pawlikowski I have a real problem. There is no one film I liked most. I loved equally: La Cienaga The Death of Mr Lazarescu You, the Living Silent Light Once Upon a Time in Anatolia The Embrace of the Serpent They all took me to places I’d never been to before, each one of them in its own, original way. Sarah Polley A Hidden Life Watching A Hidden Life was a transformative experience for me. A call to arms. Paolo Sorrentino The Wolf of Wall Street The finest comedy intermingled with the contemporary drama of humanity as it seeks a meaning and strength in its own existence, but ends up becoming a prisoner of the same, trapped in itself. And apart from that it as fine a lesson in style and imagination that any director could wish for. Michael Winterbottom Theo Who Lived I think choosing lists of the top this or the best that is a bit of a pointless task. I don’t even really have favourite films. There are loads of films that I like. If you asked me right now which film I would like to see again from the last years it might be The Beat That My Heart Skipped by Jacques Audiard, or City of God by Fernando Mereilles. But if the point of a list is to encourage people to watch a film they haven’t seen then I’d pick Theo Who Lived – not for the film itself, but for the amazing story it tells.",829
31,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/14/disney-plus-animated-films-archive-family-viewing,"remember, right at the start of the coronavirus lockdown, thinking that Disney+ would be a godsend. Finally, I thought, some quality. I could spend all this newfound time with my children soaking up Disney huge archive of old animated features. We could watch some of the most important movies ever made, and we could do it together. The first film I saw at the cinema was The Jungle Book , with my dad. It was a gift from my father, and now Disney+ was letting me give it to my children in turn. It was beautiful. Except last week we watched The Jungle Book, and it turns out that my memory of the film was much better than the film itself. I’d forgotten the end, where Mowgli is essentially led back to his village by his own boner after catching a glimpse of an absurdly sexualised girl . A similar thing happens in Bambi. Now, Bambi is a film with plenty of problems – it painfully slow, and the famous scene of his mum getting killed is brushed off within seconds – but I’d forgotten the bit where Bambi returns to the forest as an adolescent and a creepy owl basically tells him: “Well, you’re probably going to want to start humping things now.” Pinocchio loses its nostalgic sheen almost immediately, when you realise that Geppetto clocks variously depict a man trying to murder a bird, a man attempting to decapitate a turkey, an alcoholic person and a woman beating her own child. Even The Lion King has a shot of Nala lying on her back and giving Simba a saucy look . Say what you like about Jon Favreau remake , but it probably quite a good thing that photorealistic lions aren’t able to contort their faces into expressions of total sexual availability. I’m mentioning this because the results of a survey commissioned by OnBuy.com suggest that other parents are also starting to notice how dated some of the Disney classics are. Inspired by the news that a casting couch gag had been removed from Toy Story in the wake of #MeToo, it quizzed parents about which Disney films they now deem inappropriate. The survey has some interesting results. Beauty and the Beast makes the list, possibly because it a textbook manual for coercive control. So does The Aristocats and Peter Pan, probably thanks to the respective depiction of Asians and Native Americans. But the winner, with almost a full third of respondents deeming its themes to be inappropriate, was Dumbo . ‘Feasting on fantasy’: my month of extreme immersion in Disney+ And of course it is, because there is no way anyone today could make Dumbo in its original form. The crows are racial stereotypes (one of them is called Jim Crow). There a song where the only black people in the entire film hammer pegs into the ground while happily proclaiming: “We slave until we’re almost dead.” There the “pink elephants on parade” segment, where Dumbo gets drunk and hallucinates a menacing Technicolor human made of disembodied elephant heads. And, don’t forget, the happy ending of the entire film – the moral payoff to a story of enforced parental abandonment – comes in the form of the US government licensing Dumbo likeness in order to produce a fleet of heavily armoured bombers in his image. Of course, these films are products of their time, and judging things from the past by today standards is a fool errand. And my children have accidentally watched much more immediately distressing things under lockdown – an innocent YouTube search for “Lego Avengers” brought up a homemade video of Captain America getting stabbed by a burglar, for example. But Disney+ isn’t exactly the easy-peasy quarantine solver I thought it would be. I guess it time for plan B: watching the Sonic the Hedgehog movie times a day until my brain explodes.",649
32,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/12/have-a-good-trip-drugs-netflix-donick-cary,"lifelong comedy writer, Donick Cary knows full well that some entertainers radiate a sort of effortless interestingness. They’re good off the cuff, they have an unending backlog of amusing stories, and they share these anecdotes with colorful, spellbinding delivery. “My experience on Letterman was always that if we could find funny people and follow them around, we’d get something good,” Cary tells the Guardian by phone from his home quarantine. “Easier on the writers, too.” Trial by Media: a troubling Netflix series on press coverage of the courtroom That the presumption around which the new documentary Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics has been built. The film compiles a selection of candid, revealing interviews recorded over the last years with a jam-packed roster of talent, all of them getting real about their dalliances with mind-altering substances. Their recollections run the gamut from the transcendent to the euphoric to the silly to the nightmarish, forming a surprisingly sober-minded portrait of drugs as a subjective force neither good nor bad, depending only on how a person uses it. “I’ve always loved documentaries, real stories about real people,” Cary says. “I was at the Nantucket film festival about years ago, and Ben Stiller on the board. Fisher Stevens was also there to launch The Cove, and we all ended up in a conversation about psychedelics and people experiences, which turned out to be so entertaining. The Aristocrats had come out a few years before, and I realized how much I liked this vibe of an extended dinner party, with everyone sharing a story.” So began an off-and-on project that would stretch out over the next decade, as Cary undertook the work of securing interview times with a lineup of subjects that he estimates as somewhere between and The array of familiar faces making the cut ranges from standup and sketch usual suspects (Nick Kroll, David Cross, Sarah Silverman) to musical luminaries (A$AP Rocky, Sting) and late legends with an unexpectedly poignant presence (Carrie Fisher and Anthony Bourdain appear posthumously). “We were at the mercy of celebrities’ schedules,” Cary says. “Someone like Sting would be available, but he got a concert tour and he doing a stage show in London and all this other stuff. He was great, though. We just had to wait nine months.” Restricting himself to an run time meant that he had to ditch the lion share of footage on the cutting room floor, a pain that years of “killing your babies” in writers’ rooms had prepared him for. Nevertheless, that left him with some great tidbits of his own. He says he got enough material for three or four more features, which might afford him a place for the clips with Whitney Cummings, Patton Oswalt, Bootsy Collins and Ed Ruscha, a cursory sampling of his unused favorites. Some A-listers, like Dave Grohl and Paul McCartney, just weren’t gettable. In other cases, Cary got the goods, but had trouble clinching permissions. “We did sit down with Ozzy [Osbourne], and ended up not using it,” Cary recalls. “He didn’t feel comfortable after he’d told his story. He was like, ‘I don’t think I want to be in a drug movie.’ Which was fine! We respect that from anyone, but man, he got some stories … I got on the phone with Susan Sarandon, and we talked for an hour-plus on two or three occasions. But we couldn’t get her to commit to doing it or not. She had such wonderful things to say – she knew Timothy Leary, you know. But I guess I couldn’t get her to feel fully comfortable about the project. Still, these are people we were ridiculously lucky to have a little time with.” Once he’d amassed a satisfactory library of interviews to select from, Cary had to turn himself into a proper film-maker, deciding what he wanted his work to say and look like. An afternoon spent watching the Coen brothers’ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs inspired him to adopt an episodic structure, taking the yarns one by one instead of cross-cutting between them. He decided to liven things up by accompanying some segments with animated illustrations of the hijinks being related, and others with low-budget live-action re-enactments. To break up the action, he inserted a recurring faux after-school special in which four “teens” played by actors visibly in their bug out after getting dosed. Cary plays it all like a joke, but he buried a real message about intelligent, responsible usage in his shtick. “The takeaway should not be that we’re advocating this for everyone, or that absolutely everyone should do drugs,” he says. “No one should get peer-pressured into taking it, because if you start with fear and trepidation, you’re much more likely to have a bad time.” In his own soundbites as well as the ones he selected and arranged for the film, Cary urges care and preparation. Hunter S Thompson, William Burroughs, Michael Pollan, and Carlos Castaneda fill out his recommended reading list for squares curious about the ins and outs of consciousness expansion. He wants to demystify psychotropics, which could stand to benefit more people than previously assumed. “What been great in the last two or three years has been seeing a destigmatization and a more rational conversation about using psychedelics for therapy, or in therapeutic settings instead of party settings,” he says. “One of the big things we’re up against as humans is empathizing, being able to think from another person point of view. Psychedelics can help a person get out of their own box, and think their way into someone else.” He more grounded than most of acid tie-dyed advocates, yet not without an optimism about all it can do. “These remind you that we’re supposed to love each other,” he says, the closest he comes to an impression of a hippy. But he dubious of microdosing, which he believes can work but overall finds “a bit faddish”. Altogether, he comes off as a man who knows his stuff, which raises the obvious question: what hands-on field research has he conducted to become an authority on the matter? He lets out the sheepish chuckle of someone who seen it all, or at least seen plenty, and knows better than to give away his best stuff. “I don’t mean to be a politician about it – I’ve certainly had some experiences – but I’m careful because I’m raising kids,” Cary says. “One nice thing about this all taking years has been that my kids have aged through a lot of different times in their lives, and that makes me think about what I want them to see in this movie and take away from it. I want it to be balanced and rational for that kind of viewer. “Psychedelics are taken in a lot of recreational situations, but it not a recreational drug, it pretty powerful. It can be used for incredible things, but do the work and exercise caution.” Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics is now available on Netflix",1173
33,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/explain-it-to-me-quickly-is-robert-pattinson-trolling-us-with-his-horrifying-pasta-dish,"Hi Alyx. Why is everyone messaging me about Robert Pattinson chaotic pasta? Robert Pattinson, the Twilight star-turned-arthouse-powerhouse, has used his cover profile with GQ as an opportunity to promote his dream business venture. A pasta dish with the same “fast-food credentials as burgers and pizzas” that “you can hold in your hand”. He calling it Piccolini Cuscino, or “Little Pillow”. He attempted to demonstrate his prototype for Zach Baron, who interviewed him over FaceTime in isolation, and it involved cornflakes, burning a burger bun with a lighter, a large quantity of sugar, and exploding a microwave in the London apartment the producers of Batman are paying for him to live in. In other words – it is the perfect business opportunity for our times. Sorry, cornflakes, a microwave and sugar? Is he trolling us? In the words of Baron, who has written a truly excellent profile , “even now, I don’t totally know”. Still, there a long, ongoing pop culture legacy of discussing Pattinson body odour ( used to be bad ; now, according to Pattinson himself, like crayons ) Given that, it wouldn’t be wildly out of step to assume his kitchen habits are also a little ... odd. At one point he describes a type of pasta as “like a blob, a sort of squiggly blob … it looks like a sort of messy … like, the hair bun on a girl”. (Our working theory is he talking about tortellini). At another point, he frets: “I literally did this yesterday. And now it just impossible. It going to look like I can’t cook at all.” Either way, you’ve got to admire his commitment to the cause. He sets one of his latex gloves on fire while using a lighter to brand his creation with the initials “PC”. He allows “a lightning bolt” of electricity to destroy his microwave in the process of concocting this dish. And he pulls this stunt off without care for his personal safety. (It unclear who’ll pay for the broken microwave.) As for the sugar, he says: “You really need to congeal everything in an enormous amount of sugar and cheese” – which is also my approach to cooking in lockdown, so fair enough. A commitment to chaos is pretty much Pattinson MO, according to the directors he worked with. In the profile Robert Eggers describes him as “Andy Kaufman-esque in real life. Rob so beyond dry that it, like, meta. You’re like, ‘Is that funny?’ Like, ‘I have no idea what going on.’” In the piece, Pattinson also claims he can’t remember the plot of Tenet, an upcoming movie he just starred in directed by Christopher Nolan. So Baron calls Nolan to see if he being played. The response: “The interesting thing with Rob is, he slightly fucking with you.” Is it possible that he, like everyone else, is simply going mad in iso? More so than most people, Pattinson is used to being isolated. He spent a lot of his life hiding from the paparazzi – once, famously at Reese Witherspoon house , a titbit I think about too often. In the interview, he seems to be coping about as well as any of us. Even though he meant to be playing Batman, he barely working out (my hero) and he taking great liberties with his Batman diet: “I’ll have oatmeal with, like, vanilla protein powder on it. And I will barely even mix it up. It extraordinarily easy. Like, I eat out of cans and stuff. I’ll literally put Tabasco inside a tuna can and just eat it out of the can.” He also got another very relatable iso-habit: obsessively emailing people. Only it something that he always done. “I’ve been emailing this guy recently who absolutely terrified of me … He eventually passed my email on to one of the actresses in his movie so she would speak to me instead ... I thought it had been, like, two years and six months, in between each email, but it only, like, a few weeks apart.” It sounds as though he was made for isolation? That the working theory behind the whole profile, yes. And if the amazing self-portraits that accompany it are anything to go by – him, raw and unshaven, in flip-flops with socks tied around his calves – he got a second career as an indie mag photographer waiting in the wings too. But I’m hoping isolation becomes a golden age for celebrity interviews more generally. This is the kind of sprawling profile you’d read in Rolling Stone or Playboy. These days interviews are usually much more stage managed – but it impossible to control your talent in lockdown. At one point Pattinson publicist calls him and asks if she’ll need to clean up any messes after his interview, and he says: “I don’t even remember anything I said.” It happening at the Guardian too – Brigid Delaney ended up orchestrating a home-swap with Miriam Margoyles the other day . At the Washington Post, Geoff Edgers is doing hours-long live streams with famous people. Everyone going a little off-piste – and if that means more microwave pasta for us to consume, I’m here for it.",867
34,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/09/friday-the-13th-jason-voorhees,"efore production on the teen slasher A Long Night at Camp Blood had even started, before a final draft of the screenplay had even been submitted, thirtysomething writer-producer-director Sean S Cunningham decided to make an audacious statement. Not only would he use an advert in the industry paper Variety to confirm an inarguably ingenious title change but he would also use it to declare that his next film would be the most terrifying ever made, after a decade that saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Last House on the Left (which he also produced), The Exorcist and Halloween. Final Destination at the bleakest teen horror film ever made? In when Friday the was eventually released to an eager early summer audience, it may have failed to live up to such a lofty promise but it did deliver on the brashness of such a gambit. Violent, nasty, sexually explicit and hinged on a jaw-dropper of a reveal, it was the seedier, sillier sister to Halloween that enraged the morality brigade but seduced its teenage target audience. Designed as a way of cashing in on John Carpenter hit, Cunningham film boiled down the burgeoning slasher subgenre to the basest of elements – attractive young characters and grisly death scenes – and on a shoestring budget, showed that there was a hungry, underserved audience for such a basic formula. These films didn’t need expensive stars or elaborate stunts or even particularly strong actors (Cunningham admits he didn’t particularly care if the cast were anything more than likable and competent at reading lines and it only a young Kevin Bacon who makes a mark), they just needed to shock, scare and repulse and that May, Friday the managed all three, becoming a surprise smash, kickstarting what was, until very recently, the most successful horror franchise in history Halloween sequel helped to knock it off the top). Watching it years later, the barebones “horny camp counsellors get murdered” plot and hackneyed dialogue (screenwriter Victor Miller went on to mainly work on soap operas) are easy to ridicule, as they were at the time, but the film far-reaching impact on the genre is hard to discount. While the low-budget success of Halloween had already set in motion the chain of cheap rip-offs that would permeate the it was Friday the that truly expedited the process and arguably shared more in common with the majority of imitators thanks to its lighter tone and gorier deaths. The total lack of characterisation meant that the killings had little impact, turning what could have been a gruelling endurance test into a date night funhouse and setting a template for how disposable these ciphers could be in the future. It was a considerable hit at the time, making almost internationally from a budget of less than and such a staggering profit margin meant that sequels were inevitable but no one could have known just how many there would be and how, to this day, hockey mask-wearing villain Jason Voorhees would remain a haunting cultural figure, known even to those who have never seen a single Friday the film. He been name-checked in songs by Tupac, Dr Dre and Eminem (who has also worn his mask onstage), referenced in The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park and inconceivably became the first fictional character to win an MTV lifetime achievement award. What still fascinating about the first film is that neither Jason nor his mask are even to blame for the death count. Jason drowned as a kid at Camp Crystal Lake (then termed Camp Blood by gossiping locals), his death partly the result of inattentive counsellors and in the finale, we learn that it actually his vengeful mother, played by veteran actor Betsy Palmer, who has been slicing up those who dared to work there ever since. It a doozy of a twist (even if it does play into a long-running cliche that grief turns mums into psychopaths ) but after final girl Alice (played with little to no conviction by Adrienne King) decapitates her, the door seemed firmly shut on any possible follow-up. A scene of Alice floating on the lake in a boat was supposed to be the last but makeup designer, and soon-to-be horror heavyweight, Tom Savini had just seen Carrie and so suggested a jump shock ending that would introduce at least the idea that Jason was somehow still alive, a nonsensical development that then spawned a franchise. On release, Friday the was dismissed by most critics as schlock but by some as reprehensible schlock, including Gene Siskel who was so outraged by the film that he called Cunningham “one of the most despicable creatures ever to infest the movie business” while sharing Palmer home town with readers in the hopes they would share their disgust with her (the actor herself referred to the script as a “piece of shit”). Halloween had hardly had an easy time with critics (Pauline Kael called it “basic” and “chidish”), but it quickly gained respect, something that never been afforded to Friday the even with its continued prominence in the horror genre. It by far the lesser film, its meandering pace and lack of a single character to root for (final girl Alice was so disposable that she was killed off in the first scene of the sequel) making it a surprising slog, but it landed at the start of what would be a boom decade for films aimed at a teenage audience, both in and out of the horror genre. It didn’t exactly wear its smarts on its sleeve but there was a savviness to what it was offering and how it was being offered that made it commercially appealing and prophetic for an industry that had been underestimating the importance of a younger demographic. The second film, originally intended to be part of an anthology based on superstitions, was a gory rehash but it turned Jason into an immortal antagonist, seemingly impossible to kill, allowing him to return in another films, including one which was set in space, one that saw him fight Freddy Krueger and one that rebooted the story entirely. There was also a TV series, a collection of toys, a number of novels and a string of video games – a small budget B-movie that became an unusual horror-based multimillion-dollar brand, a fitting start to a decade typified by the desire for more. It been years since the last installment and after the surprise success of Halloween sequel, rumours suggest that Jason might be coming back from the dead yet again with superfan LeBron James keen to usher his return (the basketball player has already released a line of Friday the footwear with Nike as well as dressing up as Jason for Halloween). But the return of Michael Myers was a box office event because it was also the return of Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. Similarly, the makers of the recently announced new Scream film have been in discussions with Neve Campbell to reprise the role of Sidney Prescott, aware that mass audience investment in these films now relies on more than just a bad guy. While the focus on Jason, at the expense of any real protagonist, might have made him the sole star of the Friday the franchise, and as a result, an effective cash cow, it might also make a comeback that much harder. In the slick reboot might have opened to big numbers but it fell fast, catastrophically so, initial curiosity mutating into widespread lack of interest. While horror continues to prove profitable, slasher films have faded, the post-Scream surge dying down soon after, and it unclear how Jason, and Jason alone, might fit into a new decade. Killing teens is no longer enough, no matter how brutally, and if and when Jason does return, his luck may have run out.",1310

It is late morning, pre-lockdown, in a classroom at Nereida Díaz Abreu school on La Gomera in the Canary Islands, and the teacher – a bent knuckle crammed in his mouth – is relaying instructions in a piercing, swooping, set of whistles. The kids look quizzically skywards, then collapse in hysterics, although most eventually nail it. “Touch your left ear with your right hand,” the teacher reiterates in Spanish. “Ay-ay-ay!” the children hoot in disbelief. The Whistlers (La Gomera) review – thrilling Romanian corrupt-cop noir They are learning the el silbo gomero , the island whistling language, which dates back at least to the century and is now the unlikely star of a new Romanian film noir, The Whistlers . A bent Bucharest cop Cristi (Vlad Ivanov) is summoned to the distant island by a local drug gang to learn their secret language, so he can help them retrieve stolen by their eastern European middleman. It is a rich, roundabout handbook on the subtleties of communication; even the film structure, a series of flashbacks in which you are perpetually looking for who is double-crossing whom, seems to collude in this. With its deep-cut volcanic ravines, shaggy Tolkienian laurel forest and Tenerife volcano floating above the cloudline, La Gomera hits the visual jackpot. But the film director, Corneliu Porumboiu, insists it was the island aural dimension that attracted him. He came across el silbo years ago on a French TV documentary; the Canaries’ Spanish colonists inherited the language from La Gomera Guanche inhabitants , who used it to communicate across the steep valleys. “It was this strange kind of bird language that seemed to come from ancient times. So for me using this in a super-technological society created a certain type of tension and poetry – and was funny as well,” Porumboiu says. Contrary to film noir most famous whistling tip, from Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not – “You just put your lips together and blow” – el silbo takes some mastering. The film silbo consultant, Kico Correa, insisted the lead actors had to learn for real. “It been classified as Unesco World Heritage, so it needs to be treated with special respect,” he explains to me at a harbourside cafe. “You can dub the sound, but the lip movements needed to be credible.” Ivanov and Catrinel Marlon, who plays the film moll, Gilda, were both put on to a two-week silbo crash course in Bucharest, followed up later with Skype sessions. It was not simply a case of training in the physical mechanics, but also how to understand its system of letter substitution. It strips down an underlying language – Spanish, in La Gomera case – to just two vowels and four consonants. The same approximate whistling pitch, for example, is used for “A”, “O” and “U”. Rephrasings, clarifying questions and awareness of the context at hand are sometimes needed to avoid misunderstandings. Even though the actors’ whistling was eventually dubbed by the island silbo teachers, Correa gives them A for effort. Marlon, who started slightly later than Ivanov, had more natural aptitude, he says. A fashion model, she whistled so hard during practice that she had to pull out of a photoshoot in Italy because her lips were too chafed. Porumboiu lasted just a single day on the course because he was busy preparing the film. The Whistlers is a clear break from the garrulous, sly and sometimes wilfully pedantic arthouse he produced when he graduated as a leading light of the Romanian new wave. But the film use of el silbo is perfectly in line with the director longstanding interest in communication; how the relationship between language and meaning is rarely straightforward. It is there in his debut East of Bucharest , with its radio show guests bickering about how the exact moment the news of Ceauşescu deposal was relayed to their backwater town is crucial to deciding whether it can be said an actual revolution took place there. Or the police captain played by Ivanov in Police, Adjective , who turns to the dictionary for the definition of his profession to solve a crisis of conscience. Or the bureaucrat in Porumboiu last film, Infinite Football , whose tinkering with the rules of the sport doesn’t pan out in reality. The director wrings out a colourful stream of comic possibility from misinterpretation in these films, but language, via el silbo , plays a darker, concealing role in The Whistlers, a world in which people can rarely express themselves truthfully. The director, speaking on the phone under lockdown in the Romanian countryside, is at a loss to explain his interest in the theme. “To be honest, I’m not doing it on purpose. It a personal matter, this feeling that we don’t understand each other.” Where does it come from? “I think it coming from … my inability … ” He tails off. We say to the kids: when you go to Tenerife and say you’re from La Gomera, people will ask you if you can whistle Kiko Correa Back in March on La Gomera, I am having my own communication issues. Five minutes of efforts better described as spitting than whistling are enough to leave my deoxygenated head spinning. But Correa – a short, calm Gomero who resembles Robert Forster – has had to learn patience in his day job organising the island silbo syllabus. The language had virtually died out in the associated with a peasant lifestyle many people were keen to leave behind. Correa parents were among a minority who didn’t view it as backward. “My family thought differently: we’re going to make our children learn it, so they can be in advance,” he says in French, the only language both of us understand. El silbo moment came in the late when an upsurge in interest resulted in a push to make it compulsory on the school curriculum. Now learning it for half an hour each week is obligatory for six-year-olds and upwards; three- to five-year-olds also receive tuition, mostly in comprehension. “We don’t make a big effort to say: ‘You should learn it to support your culture,’” says Correa. “It too much weight for kids. We encourage them to do it for fun. We say: ‘When you go to Tenerife and say you’re from La Gomera, people are going to ask you if you can whistle.’” I also sit in on an impressively adept classroom of teenagers, chattering away in silbo like manic songbirds. But how much do they use it in everyday life? Marta, a regular victor in the class silbo competitions, says: “Sometimes. For fun. But mobile phones are easier.” Gabriel, rosy-cheeked with an unexpected Mancunian accent (his family came to live on La Gomera nine years ago), sheepishly admits he doesn’t practise enough. He can understand the language, but his whistling is below par: “We only have lessons once a week, but I can’t really do it.” The education programme is vital for preserving this rare offshoot of the world linguistic tree. But from the silence reigning over La Gomera stepped basalt cliffs, where there are few shepherds now, it is clear that it not quite a living language, either; it mostly heard in classrooms or in restaurants, in demonstrations for tourists. While The Whistlers is unlikely to make the island hills suddenly alive with the sound of unusually articulate birds, it should help magnify el silbo worldwide cultural status. Correa appears briefly in the film as a Gomero gangster, but was originally slated for a bigger part as the teacher; as Porumboiu learned more about the language and the role expanded, it called for a professional actor. Correa, though, is not disappointed. The sound of his ear-splitting whistles ringing out between Bucharest apartment blocks on screen testify to him having fully communicated his passion: “My character in the film is el silbo . It me.” The Whistlers and Infinite Football will stream from May in the UK and Ireland on Curzon Home Cinema",1355

But I wanted to take viewers on an emotional journey, so they could empathise with the character.” The #MeToo saga has been examined to near exhaustion, but The Assistant manages to add something new. Rather than perpetrators or victims, it focuses on a relative bystander: a young office worker at a New York film production company. We follow this character, played by Julia Garner, through her demeaning routine: commuting in before daybreak, photocopying, printing, taking her male co-workers’ lunch orders, clearing up leftover pizza from the meeting room (as the men come in for the next meeting, she is humiliatingly caught with a crust in her mouth). All this is interspersed with moments of everyday sexism and bullying communications from the Weinstein-like boss next door, who is not named or depicted. The Assistant doesn’t amp up the drama or trowel on the message: instead, it shines a cold, clear light on a culture of complicity, silence and misogyny, not to mention the general dehumanising nature of office life. The more real you make it, the more people are forced to interrogate their own role in all this Green previous films were documentaries , often centred on women, often stylistically adventurous. But for The Assistant, she opts for an unfussy approach. “In fiction film-making,” she says, “you can use the closeup to amplify micro-aggressions, tiny moments that often get overlooked.” Green still researched her story like a documentary, though, interviewing hundreds of working women worldwide. “The more real you make it, the more people are forced to interrogate their own role in all this.” As well as its relevance to the #MeToo moment, The Assistant is a type of film we’ve been seeing a lot in US cinema lately: one concerned with everyday experience, particularly of those on the lower rungs if not the margins – yet reflective of modern America as a whole. Authentic settings and scenarios are prioritised over exaggerated dramatics or showy technique (if you want an example of the latter in terms of #MeToo, go see Bombshell ). Strikingly, many of these films are being made by and/or about women. We’ve had the likes of Debra Granik Leave No Trace , about a disturbed survivalist father and his teenage daughter living in the woods; Sean Baker The Florida Project , which follows a single mother living hand to mouth in an Orlando motel; Chloé Zhao The Rider , about a Dakota rodeo star suffering ahead injury. And then there was Andrea Arnold American Honey , in which a teen runaway falls in with a hedonistic bunch; and Andrew Bujalski Support the Girls , about female workers banding together at an exploitative sports bar. In Europe, such films would be readily classified as “realism”, in the vein of the neorealist cinema of Italy or the “social realism” of Ken Loach and Mike Leigh in the UK. But in the US, the idea of realism has never quite taken root. In commercial Hollywood especially, sociopolitical issues must always be refracted through the prism of genre: horror and sci-fi are the popular choices. Escapist cinema will always have its appeal. But perhaps, given America current – and worsening – predicament, audiences are now starting to crave films that strive to make sense of the here and now, rather than distract from it. A further sign comes in the form of Eliza Hittman Never Rarely Sometimes Always , about to have a streaming release in the UK. It concerns a Pennsylvanian teenager who travels to New York with her cousin to get a termination. As with The Assistant, the drama is low-key, almost documentary-like. There is no speechifying and no sentimentality: the characters don’t learn a redeeming lesson, offer a political insight or bond in a heartwarming way. Instead, we’re faced with the bare, brutal reality of the situation, which is compounded by the fact that these young women have no money, nowhere to stay, and little experience of the world. In the drama Months, Weeks and Days , told a similar story about a woman seeking an illegal termination in Ceauşescu Romania. Modern-day America looks just as grim in Never Rarely Sometimes Always, which won an award at Sundance this year in the category of neorealism . Tellingly, this was a new category at the festival. Could the prevalence of female film-makers have something to do with this wave? Opportunities have improved in recent years, it could be said, resulting in fresh perspectives on both the plight of women and the fragilities of male identity in modern America. It would be wrong, however, to assume that female film-makers naturally lean towards more personal, real-life subjects. A more likely factor, suggests Green, is the industry lingering apprehension over women. “They’ll fund us,” she says, “when it an area they think we have authority on. If I came to them with a dystopian sci-fi movie, they might not believe I could pull it off. But if I say it about a assistant, they might think: ‘Oh, OK, that something she might know something about.’” The idea of a socially conscious, class-conscious cinema has always been deeply suspect in America Hardship and poverty often go hand in hand with realism, and not just in front of the camera. One reason Italian neorealism caught on worldwide was because it was cheap to make. Perhaps this is why it never really took root in the US. “The idea of a socially conscious, class-conscious cinema has always been deeply suspect in America,” says Paul Malcolm, film programmer at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Perhaps, he adds, the US establishment was reluctant to admit to a foreign influence, especially when its focus on societal ills and the plight of the working class came with connotations of socialism and communism. A very slender realist thread does run through US film history, however, says Malcolm, who recently co-curated a film season entitled American Neorealism, Part One to . This showcased the likes of John Cassavetes’ Shadows (a rough, jazzy race drama shot on the streets of New York), Jerry Schatzberg The Panic in Needle Park (with the young Al Pacino as a junkie) and Barbara Loden Wanda (in which she plays a runaway wife drifting through grimy Pennsylvania). To these we should add landmark African-American films such as Shirley Clarke The Cool World and Charles Burnett Killer of Sheep. The neorealist strand also runs through black and minority film-making, from Boyz N t he Hood to Fruitvale Station . Part two of UCLA film season is on hiatus due to the pandemic, but the list of potential candidates is getting longer by the month. Ironically, economic adversity could actually be a factor in the scarcity of US realism. It often becomes a calling card. Film-makers who have paid their dues and garnered critical acclaim through realist dramas are often tempted to bigger (but not always better) things. It happened to such great Italian neorealists as Vittoria de Sica , Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini. It is also happening to their current US successors. Kelly Reichardt successfully transposed her realist sensibility to such period pieces as Meek Cutoff . Her latest, First Cow, may be set in the but is no less a tale of graft and survival. On the other hand, Chloé Zhao is currently working on the Marvel movie Eternals, which is unlikely to ever be confused with The Rider. Still, while it marks a defection from the realist camp, the move also signals a big-budget vote of confidence in a rising film-maker. Kitty Green has plans but is not willing to discuss them just yet. Realism always seems to be born out of crisis. In Italy, it grew from the ruins of the second world war. Before that, a realist movement in art developed in the US and elsewhere in the in the wake of the Great Depression. In fact, one of the most enduring fruits of social realism in the US was the Farm Security Administration , set up as part of Franklin D Roosevelt New Deal in the Its remit was to document the impact of the Depression on rural communities, through photography as well as film. But its images went beyond the merely factual, often achieving the emotional impact of a drama. The prime example is Dorothea Lange famous Migrant Mother photograph, which the Library of Congress captioned: “Destitute pea pickers in California. Mother of seven children. Age Nipomo, California.” The photograph has come to encapsulate the whole era not just because it captures what happened but because – given the worry etched across the woman face as she holds her young – it also shows how those times felt. To future historians, such films as The Assistant or Never Rarely Sometimes Always could be this image equivalents. With a new depression looming, there could be more like it to come. If realism is what a crisis calls for, the conditions could hardly be better, which is to say worse. The Assistant is out now on digital platforms.",1538
37,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/15/barely-breathed-tilda-swinton-emma-thompson-best-ever-nights-at-movies,"‘You didn’t sit where the tramps peed themselves’ Mike Leigh In my days as an impecunious young cineaste, there was the Tolmer cinema in Euston, the cheapest picturehouse in London, or anywhere – two shillings a time. A converted church, it was filthy, decrepit and gloriously eclectic. It showed whatever they could find, new prints and old. The Leopard – the original version, no subtitles; Hellzapoppin’; Rashomon; Svenska Flickor I Franska Sexorgier . Incomplete prints, sudden random reels from other films, frames catching fire in the projector. Wonderful. An education in cinema. But you didn’t sit where the tramps peed themselves. ‘A spear flung from the back of the crowd stays dangling on the screen’ Tilda Swinton A sheet hung on a tree in the middle of a village in Kitui County, Kenya, a cranky old western screened via an even crankier old projector and its generator, which was all driven round by two geezers from Nairobi in a loop from Somalia to Tanzania and up and over again every two years or so. An audience of hundreds, gathered from a distance of many miles. In the middle of the shoot-out in the saloon, a spear flung from the back of the crowd hits the baddie in the chest and stays dangling in the heart of the sheet right up to the final romantic clinch. Unforgettable. Magic cinema of dreams, you rock us everywhere and always – ad astra and back, ad infinitum and beyond. Respect. ‘Not a whiff of fast food’ Ken Loach Not one ecstatic moment, but a tale of three cinemas, from half a century ago. The Hippodrome in Nuneaton was an old variety theatre, rumoured to have livestock in the faded velvet seats. No matter, for late adolescents, lowering their voices to get into French films such as La Ronde, it was an escape to an exotic world far removed from the industrial Midlands. Then there was the Phoenix in Oxford in the late and the films of Ingmar Bergman, Andrzej Wajda and the first splash of the French New Wave. Finally, there was the Academy, on Oxford Street in London, where we shared the joys of the Czech films of the Closely Observed Trains, A Blonde in Love (AKA Loves of a Blonde) and many more. They were all cinemas with great memories – and not a whiff of fast food in any of them! ‘I had butterflies in my stomach right up to my chest’ Steve McQueen My first time in a cinema was seeing The Magnificent Seven at the Hammersmith Odeon, in London. I remember brushing my hand along the side of the wall and being shocked that it was carpeted. West Indians have a big affiliation with westerns, and watching that one with my father was a big thing. The film was incredible; an amazing cacophony of sound and image. I had butterflies in my stomach right up to my chest. I must also mention a matinee reissue of North by Northwest years ago at the Lumiere in St Martin Lane, an underground cinema in the centre of London that is now a gym. You would go down three or four flights of stairs, shedding the reality of life in London, and find yourself in this gorgeous oval space, like being inside a whale ribcage. Alfred Hitchcock created that film for an audience. He orchestrated their oohs and aahs, when they would lean forward and when they would sit back. This wasn’t about someone on the sofa at home getting distracted by their phone or the doorbell or going to get a drink. The place was full of energy and at the end everyone stood and applauded; just as they did when I saw Slumdog Millionaire at the ArcLight in Los Angeles. Can you imagine being on a rollercoaster ride on your own? The majority of the experience is that you are with other people and are thrilled together. That what makes it exciting. There is nothing better than witnessing a story with other people. It is a collective thing and a confirmative of humanity. I am just desperate that people do go back to cinemas. It too painful. I don’t want this to ever die – and I am definitely not alone. ‘I wanted to feel the way I was feeling at that moment for ever’ Emma Thompson Superman, Huge cinema. We were It was exciting, funny and dramatic but, rarest of all, the female lead was as interesting and inspiring as the male even though she couldn’t fly on her own. When I exited the cinema I wanted to feel the way I was feeling at that moment for ever. ‘In the dark, among strangers, I was transformed’ Sarah Polley I saw The Thin Red Line in a cinema in Toronto in Canada when I was I entered the theatre militantly atheist, depressed and with the belief that working in film was a superficial thing to do with one life. I left the theatre with a glimpse of what faith meant, having been lifted and carried out of my sadness, and wanting to make my own films one day. In the dark of the cinema, among strangers, I was transformed. ‘The blue-white light filling the auditorium. It was bewitching’ Steve Coogan I remember an October evening when my mother took me and a couple of friends to the local fleapit for my birthday to see a double bill of Live and Let Die and On Her Majesty Secret Service. The memory still gives me goose bumps. Being transported to the sunny Everglades, watching a glamorous speedboat chase, followed by John Barry best score accompanying George Lazenby and Diana Rigg skiing in the Swiss Alps. The blue-white light filling the auditorium. It was bewitching. My mum fell asleep. How could she? I remember the jolt of reality as I stepped outside into the cold damp night. They were silly films really, but that childhood excitement has stayed with me. A well-crafted story, a cinematic experience is unique. In two hours you can give people a profound experience, make them question themselves, make them cry, make them laugh, lift them up and give them hope. ‘As we had read it already, we couldn’t possibly be scared’ Edgar Wright My whole career has been spent trying to replicate the various highs I have had in a cinema. One memorable screening at my local cinema in Somerset was the afternoon I happened to see the Gremlins at the age of My brother and I approached the manager with the novelisation of Gremlins in hand, explaining that, as we had read it, we couldn’t possibly be scared by the actual film. Amazingly, he let us in and the thrill of watching the film, while also thinking I could be thrown out at any moment, was off the charts. I am still chasing that buzz. ‘A purely human form of communication, rooted in desire, myth and magic’ László Nemes Son of Saul László Nemes: 'Our civilisation is preparing for its own destruction' As the past years have been highly effective in killing the true experience of a physical projected film by installing what are effectively television screens in cinemas, I recall with increasing nostalgia watching a restored print of Stanley Kubrick Barry Lyndon more than a decade ago. It was truly visceral and thought-provoking at the same time, while reaffirming for me the appeal of a work grounded in craftsmanship, made in a physical dimension, with every cut thoroughly thought through. There was no place for computers, only a purely human form of communication, rooted in desire, myth and magic. ‘You could hear the rattle of the film on the sprockets’ Michael Winterbottom When I was about or I discovered there was a film society in Blackburn, Lancashire. It screened films once a week in a small room at the top of the library. To be honest, I don’t remember which was the first film that I saw there, but they had programmed a German season, so it might have been Rainer Werner Fassbinder Fear Eats the Soul, or Wim Wenders Alice in the Cities, or Werner Herzog The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser. The films were shown on a projector which was in the room, so you could hear the rattle of the film on the sprockets. At the end of each reel there was a break, the lights went on, and someone got up from the audience and laced up the next reel. There was something simple and mechanical and magical about having the projector there right next to you, which was matched by the films themselves – low-budget, shot on location, often with non-professional actors, they seemed at the same time recognisable and exotic, simple yet loaded with meaning which they felt no need to explain. ‘Total madness and joy’ Whit Stillman The best ever experience was the pre-Christmas all-cartoon children matinees at the Storm King theatre , in Cornwall-on-Hudson, NY. They were the form art at its peak – total madness and joy. At the Orson Welles cinema near Harvard, my projectionist brother would splice together Bugs Bunny: Superstar for the cinema manager Larry Jackson, starting the cartoon features craze. Then there were seeing war films with my father: The Longest Day, Days at Peking and, during a summer sailing cruise, Zulu at the magnificent Criterion theatre in Bar Harbor, Maine. With my mother, there were delightful foreign films such as Genevieve, Kind Hearts &amp; Coronets and Divorce Italian Style. But it was a double-feature in that I saw at the Harvard Square theatre that set me on my career: François Truffaut Bed &amp; Board (loved), and Eric Rohmer Claire Knee (hated, except the knee). ‘The cinema must be the headlights of our new society’ Francis Ford Coppola Francis Ford Coppola: 'Apocalypse Now is not an anti-war film' In these difficult times, people are frightened and yearn for what they call “back to normal”. But who now would say that the most important concerns are what we earn or how much we are worth? Nothing is more important than the health and safety of those we love, universal education, justice and care of our common home, Earth. Perhaps now it is the artists, especially the cinema, who need play the role of being the “headlights” of society: to express themes and principles to stimulate and change our former long-held priorities. “Where are we really going?” said Novalis. “Always home.” ‘I barely breathed’ Tricia Tuttle Seeing a good film is always a pleasure, on any platform. Yet my most vivid viewing memories are overwhelmingly ones where I am lost in story, watching flickering lights in a dark room with other people. I saw Peter Jackson Heavenly Creatures in a small independent three-screen venue in a suburban strip mall. Drawn into the feverish, obsessive private world of teenaged Juliet and Pauline as they fell in love, I barely breathed; it was a totally immersive experience and Jackson and Kate Winslet dictated my every heartbeat as the film dragged me towards a brutal finale. I knew the ending was inevitable. Pauline narration had already told me so. But dread overwhelmed me. A path through a wood, a rock. The horrible deed was done and the lights came up but few people left the cinema. I was suddenly overcome with all of the emotion that Pauline must have felt – sober with sudden loss, aching with remorse and regret. I sat in a fully lit cinema and cried with strangers. Tricia Tuttle is artistic director of the London film festival ‘Bats swooped through the moonlight’ Cameron Bailey I have watched Oprah Winfrey dazzle people at TIFF Roy Thomson Hall; I have felt the buzz of Amitabh Bachchan sitting among us. But I will never forget Fespaco (the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou). There, in Burkina Faso, I have joined hundreds in an open-air cinema, as bats swooped through moonlight and the bright screen bathed us in homegrown balm. We communed. Cameron Bailey is artistic director of the Toronto film festival ‘I was secretly a bit freaked out at how scuzzy the seats were’ Peter Bradshaw When I was years old in I was in New York City for work and one night I daringly went on my own to see a film called Blood Simple at the Waverly theater in Greenwich Village. Timid Brit country mouse that I was, I was secretly a bit freaked out at how scuzzy and hard the seats were, how sticky the carpet was and how eerily, menacingly sparse the audience seemed. Then I was even more freaked out – and transported and disturbed – by the film itself. When Dan Hedaya sinister bar owner appears to barf a gallon of blood, I felt this blood had leaked out through the screen and was pooling around my feet on the thrillingly icky floor. The film was intimately horrible, and it fused in my mind with the cinema itself. It was only when I was back in the creepily plush Coenesque Warwick hotel that I fully realised how weirdly glorious that experience was. Peter Bradshaw is the Guardian film critic ‘She sat beside me in the stalls: bare midriff, jewels and veils’ David Thomson At the Granada, in Tooting, I was eight-ish, watching Samson and Delilah: unimpressed with the religious stuff but fearful of having a haircut. So I dreaded her golden scissors with Victor Mature locks clattering on the floor. Then Delilah came and sat beside me in the stalls – bare midriff, jewels and veils, in a sickly perfume. Miss Lamar looked at me and whispered in her sinister way: “Not to be afraid, sweetheart.” No, this couldn’t have happened. But years later, when Hedy was revealed as a mistress of electronic intimacy , I was not surprised. David Thomson writes on film for the Guardian ‘I can still feel my jaw literally dropping open’ Hadley Freeman The movie to see in August was, of course, Terminator And so, encouraged by the five-star review in my then guide to life, Empire magazine, I headed to the Odeon on Kensington High Street. The cinema was packed out. I was not surprised. After all, Empire had said this movie was IMPORTANT. Empire was right. I can still feel my jaw literally dropping open when the walks through the bars. Those special effects, coined by James Cameron, completely – it is no hyperbole to say – blew my mind. I have been to a lot of movies since then and seen a lot of CGI. But nothing will ever compete with seeing that on the big screen for the first time. I felt like I had just witnessed the first talking picture. And, in a certain way, I had. Hadley Freeman is a Guardian writer and columnist ‘A runaway pram ploughed at speed’ Xan Brooks Cinema was a fairground attraction at Thorpe Park in Surrey in the I went on a school trip when I was You stood in a dome and stared at a wraparound screen. This showed POV shots from the front car of a rollercoaster or a ski-jumper helmet. The aim was immersion; I was fully immersed. For the grand finale, a runaway pram ploughed at speed down a hill and on to a busy main road. At the very last gasp, a lorry hit the brakes. The shock was so great I fell flat on my face. Xan Brooks writes on film for the Guardian ‘You could almost feel the air being sucked out of the room’ Anne Billson I had watched Jack Clayton film The Innocents on TV, VHS and DVD, but I had never really seen it until when Brussels Cinematek showed it on the big screen. For the first time I was truly able to appreciate Freddie Francis exquisite black and white cinematography with its immaculate widescreen framing and beautiful deep focus – all designed to scare the bejeesus out of you. And so, when the ghost appeared at the window behind Miss Giddens, you could almost feel the air being sucked out of the room as the entire audience gasped in unison. Cinematic nirvana. Anne Billson writes on film for the Guardian ‘The smoking section and the non-smoking section both erupted with applause’ Ryan Gilbey When Indiana Jones dispatched with a single lazy bullet the fancypants swordsman in Raiders of the Lost Ark , the audience at the Harlow Odeon in Essex erupted into crazed applause: the smoking section on the left of the auditorium, the non-smoking section on the right, everyone clapping wildly in the blue haze. It was a midweek evening in the early and I was a stunned I had never heard applause in a cinema. I am generally not a fan. Unless the film-makers are in the room, please restrain yourselves. But this was different – a helpless outpouring of spontaneous joy. Remember those? Ryan Gilbey writes on film for the Guardian ‘People were screaming and crying and grabbing each other for comfort’ Stuart Heritage I saw the first Kill Bill in a packed cinema in the UK, where it played to total silence. Then, a fortnight later, I moved to South Korea. This is where I saw the sequel. The difference was like night and day. As soon as the first big set-piece kicked in – as soon as Uma Thurman got shot – it was bedlam. People were screaming and crying and grabbing each other for comfort, and it didn’t let up until the end credits. My boss told me afterwards that she truly believed she was going to vomit. She meant it as a compliment, too. Stuart Heritage is a Guardian writer ‘Scream was the perfect anniversary date movie’ Benjamin Lee At I was in love for the first time. He was smart, handsome, hated queue-jumping and, most seductively, like me also wrote fan fiction for an imagined fourth Scream movie as a teen. It was meant to be. And so the release of an actual fourth Scream movie on the same weekend as our one-year anniversary felt almost comically serendipitous. My friends ridiculed my inexperienced idea of romance, but to us, having spent our younger years obsessing over the slasher franchise, it felt like the perfect date. And it was. Not just the thrill of reuniting with characters we had grown up with, but of knowing we were each just as thrilled as the other. In my teens, film had been something I was accustomed to mostly experiencing alone and so there was something hugely comforting about that warm spring evening, at a wildly overpriced and eerily empty Odeon, experiencing it with him instead, holding hands as we swooned over a string of vicious and deadly stabbings. Benjamin Lee is arts editor of Guardian US ‘I was completely unprepared for full-immersion trauma’ Andrew Pulver As you stumble from screening to screening, film festivals can be bit of a chore – but they can also create the conditions for supercharged cinema, particularly as you are normally watching films you know next to nothing about, and expect even less. The sensational “Mexican dog movie” that turned out to be called Amores Perros, a super-violent Brazilian gang saga that went on to become City of God, a new one from “the Pi guy” that distilled the crystalline insanity of Hubert Selby Jr Requiem for a Dream. But the one that still stands out is the first showing in of Son of Saul at Cannes. I knew dimly that it was about Auschwitz, but I was completely unprepared for the full-immersion trauma that would follow, a totally unvarnished attempt to recreate the dehumanising nightmare of the Nazi death camp. It was a shattering experience; I still haven’t got over it. Andrew Pulver is the Guardian associate editor, film ‘Just Richard Gere and the cicadas’ Catherine Shoard Together in the dark: what we miss about going to the movies It hadn’t been the best day of the trip. Cash was low. Tempers a bit scratchy. We had been so long (two-and-a-half-weeks!) so far (Greece!) from home. It was a daft plan to backpack all day down the Samariá gorge in heat. You couldn’t turn around. There was no shade and no coffee. A man died on the boat back. Then we went to see Autumn in New York at Paleochora outdoor cinema. God it was awful, and God it was perfect. The place was pretty deserted; just us, the beer and gyros, the cicadas and the moon, Richard Gere at his smuggest and Winona Ryder manic pixie dream milliner, unconvincingly smitten.

Even those who’ve never ventured out of the city will appreciate its immersive take on provincial culture, a way to calm your travel bug during this interminable lockdown. My streaming gem: why you should watch Nobody Watching The Argentinian drama stars Oscar Martínez, also seen in Wild Tales (another Argentinian Netflix gem), as Daniel Mantovani, a Nobel-winning fiction writer living in Barcelona. After winning the grand prize that has to this day eluded Argentinian writers, he gets a letter from his home town, where he hasn’t lived for years, inviting him back to receive a special award in recognition of his achievement and the town highest honor. He at first apprehensive, but realizes that a vacation to the soul of his writings – the town and its people inspired all his novels – may do him good. But, upon arrival in Salas, a fictional place in the middle of nowhere, town life soon consumes him. What he thought would be a quiet retreat to his roots quickly escalates. The longer he stays, the more his presence seems to rot, as does his power and control over the place. As the pride of the town, Mantovani is paraded around on a fire engine by the mayor, presented with a bust and a painted mural of himself and asked to teach a workshop. He charmed at first, but Mantovani cosmopolitan cynicism starts to clash with the townspeople. When a childhood friend, played by comedian Dady Brieva, finds him, the life he ostensibly exiled himself from and the woman he left behind hook him back in. Two narratives unfold simultaneously. The first is directly in front of the viewer, watching Mantovani, a caricature of himself, trying to navigate his few days around the townies. The jaded writer is tense but tolerant at first. Finally, he rebels – and is met with a life-threatening scenario. The second narrative, and whether it exists at all, is up to the viewer to debate. What happening in Mantovani head? Was it Mantovani intention to leave the town the way he does? While some may find the results of this set-up predictable, I found it packed with keen observations and intriguing ideas. By bringing a conventionally successful writer back to his old town, the film raises questions about the creative process, the responsibility of writers, and how their fiction – or what is, at least, supposed to be – can affect reality. It also explores a package of classic oppositions: town v city, tradition v progress, morals v ethics, nationalism v globalism, honesty v fact. With such universal themes, one could easily see the film recreated and textured with the aesthetics of another country. Yet it exactly the precision of detail in the film setting that makes it unique and so real. Like the Coen brothers’ Fargo or Harper Lee Maycomb, The Distinguished Citizen directors, Gastón Duprat and Mariano Cohn, create a character of their fictional Salas. It in the small things: the mayor unbuttoned shirt, the khaki-colored Renault with corroding bumpers, the colonial-era buildings covered in moss and art deco fonts peeling off the walls. Even the sing-song tone of the town public TV host is quintessential to the decaying Anytown Argentinian pueblo. It exactly this mix of precise reality and obtuse cliche that allows the film to flourish. Although it might appear so, by the nature of the themes it explores, The Distinguished Citizen is not trying to make a political statement or take a stance. It does not posit a right and left or right and wrong. It does, however, force the viewer to question themselves and whether they find themselves laughing at Mantovani or the townspeople. I’d argue there room for a Hollywood remake, ideally one that works better than the glossy redo of Argentinian thriller The Secret in Their Eyes. In this climate of political division in the United States, it might soothe some sores. The Distinguished Citizen is available on Netflix in the UK and US",693
39,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/28/uwe-boll-director-bloodrayne-alone-in-the-dark,"Film critics around the world can finally breathe a sigh of relief, not least because they no longer risk having their teeth knocked out. For Uwe Boll, the fiercely combative German film-maker regularly cited as the world worst director, has left the building. Uwe Boll: Hollywood elite should be 'wiped out' Following a career stretching back more than a quarter of a century, taking in more than movies, that famous incident in which he literally fought his critics , and a unique “worst career achievement award” Razzie in it all ends here. The Canada-based film-maker, who has long used German tax shelter laws to keep working despite his movies routinely failing to break even at the box office, has announced his retirement in the face of falling home video sales. “The market is dead. You don’t make any money anymore on movies because the DVD and Blu-ray market worldwide has dropped in the last three years,” the director, who specialised in adapting video games for films that even fans of the games hated, told the Toronto issue of Metro . “That is the real reason; I just cannot afford to make movies.” But Boll being Boll, he could not quite resist departing the scene without sending one last barb in the direction of his critics. “Now when I don’t make any more movies, maybe they find the time to actually watch the movies, starting with Postal in the movies of the last years,” he said. “They will see they were a lot of very interesting movies and a lot of movies that I think made sense and said a point about things. They deserve to be discussed bigger than they were.” So we decided to take up Boll challenge and re-examine five of his best known movies from the past decade. Can they really be all that bad? Postal What Uwe Boll thinks this movie is: Dr Strangelove for the Jackass generation, a knockabout satire on political incorrectness, trash culture and angst. What it really is: A sort-of low-rent Falling Down. American Beauty as scripted by Beavis and Butthead. Based on the video game Postal which is famed for its ultra-violence and scorn for politically correct mores, Postal stars little-known actor Zack Ward as the volatile, downtrodden Postal Dude, whose day goes from bad to worse after he ridiculed at a job interview, cuckolded by his neighbour and thrown out of the local unemployment office. The original game sees the Dude running amok through a small Arizonan town filled with violent, gun-toting citizens, but Boll instead sets up a battle royale between Islamist terrorists (led naturally by a suspiciously American-sounding Osama bin Laden) and scantily clad, buxom cultist nut jobs. Boll favourite trick is to repeatedly show us the Dude morbidly obese wife in flagrante with various members of the local populace as her husband looks on in horror from the corner of his trailer. But there even worse to come, as the movie progresses from fart gags to rape jokes and finally on to pedophile jokes as its director does his best to offend the sensibilities of anyone with eyes. Famous for: The terrible opening scene in which two hijackers discover they may not get their due as martyrs because bin Laden is running low on virgins. Career low for: Future Oscar-winner JK Simmons as Candidate Welles, or possibly diminutive Austin Powers star Verne Troyer – who gets violated by monkeys. Verdict: In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale What Uwe Boll thinks this movie is: Big-budget fantasy for fans of the Lord of the Rings movies What it really is: A collection of by-the-numbers Tolkien tropes, and about as much fun as a night out in Mordor If you thought Warcraft was bad, check out Boll achingly turgid attempt at swords and sorcery, starring Jason Statham as a lowly peasant fighting to save a medieval kingdom from an invasion of Orc-like creatures with only distinctly anachronistic martial arts moves and a fricking boomerang to help him in his quest. The dialogue is shonky to say the least, the plotting puffy and bloated. Worst of all, Boll assumes that the epic nature of the genre requires him to stretch out the horror to a bum-numbing two and a half hours – though it feels even longer. Famous for: Carries the dubious distinction of being the only movie in Hollywood history in which Statham turns out to be Burt Reynolds’ son. Career low for: Lord of the Rings’ John Rhys-Davies, who went from playing the dual roles of Gimli and Treebeard the Ent in Peter Jackson Oscar-winning fantasy trilogy to this in just four years. Verdict: Alone in the Dark What Uwe Boll thinks this movie is: An all-action blend of sci-fi noir and paranormal thriller – Raymond Chandler meets The X-Files. What it really is: A collection of Hollywood action cliches packaged as a movie. Often described as one of the worst films ever made, Alone in the Dark perhaps epitomizes Boll ability to produce what can only be described as a sort-of reverse Tarantino effect. Where the Pulp Fiction director reworks cheap B-movie material with diamond-cut dialogue and masterful staging, the German director steals all the best bits from classic Hollywood action adventure and stitches them together to create a horrifyingly ersatz frankenmovie. Alone in the Dark features an opening segue in the style of James Bond, monsters that resemble Alien xenomorphs and one entire scene (and plenty of plot elements) from Indiana Jones. In every dark corner seems to lurk another cliche, from the tense rivalry between Christian Slater paranormal investigator Edward Carnby and his replacement at a shadowy government agency, Stephen Dorff commander Richard Burke, to the denouement in which one of the main characters heroically sacrifices himself to save the world from all those hideous monsters from another dimension. Famous for: The excruciating scene in which genius archeologist Tara Reid sciences up the location of the demon horde using only the power of the stars, an old PC and some ancient Mesoamerican artefacts. Career low for: Reid, who got a Razzie for worst actress for her performance, though Slater and Dorff can both take their share of the blame. Verdict: Tunnel Rats What Uwe Boll thinks this movie is: Heartrending tale of enduring humanity in the face of unspeakable horrors. The new Platoon. What it really is: Passable, minimalistic Vietnam war drama starring a cast of enthusiastic unknowns. Tunnel Rats is supposedly Boll best work, a war movie about the American soldiers who were sent into the Viet Cong sprawling network of underground tunnels during the Vietnam war. But when the director treats us to a gratuitous shot of some actual rats within the first few moments, we are reminded this is a director on whom the concepts of subtlety and symbolism are somewhat lost. Still, Boll regular Michael Paré does a passable imitation of Tom Berenger as a battle-hardened lieutenant, and there a pleasing poignancy to the doomed infantrymen pre-battle badinage. Famous for: Boll decision to allow the cast to improvise off his original script treatment , which may just explain the superior dialogue when compared to the rest of the German oeuvre. Career low for: No famous faces here, but the controversial actor and director of The Birth of a Nation, Nate Parker, plays Pte Jim Lidford. Verdict: BloodRayne What Uwe Boll thinks this movie is: Fast-paced and stylish period horror. What it really is: Video game-inspired cod-gothic schlock with an obscenely awful script. Bloodrayne is not completely unwatchable, but the dialogue is typically risible and the plotting seriously clunky. Furthermore, the film-maker cloaks the entire movie in a strange red filter, as if to paper over the cracks. Terminator Kristanna Loken stars as Rayne, a half-human, half-vampire creature who hunts her bloodsucking brethren (so a bit like Blade then) in a weird version of century Romania where everyone is American or British. Following a conveniently timed encounter with a fortune teller, she sets out on a quest to destroy her creepy father Kagan (Ben Kinsgley), a vampire who raped and then killed her mother. Loken has the most erratic British accent since Keanu Reeves’ mangled vowels in Francis Ford Coppola Dracula, and Billy Zane wears the worst wig since Colin Farrell in Oliver Stone Alexander. Famous for: Boll cost-saving decision to hire actual prostitutes instead of actors for a scene featuring Meat Loaf as a peruke-wearing libertine vampire. Career low for: Michael Madsen, who later described the film as an “abomination”. And Kingsley, who did his best with an appalling script but still got a Razzie nomination for worst supporting actor.

40,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/04/why-christian-bale-will-always-be-the-best-batman,"Hindsight in Hollywood can be a terrible thing. Not so long ago, Pierce Brosnan publicly lamented his run as James Bond being “never good enough” and admitted he hates watching himself as Now Christian Bale has stepped up to take aim at his own generally rather well-received turn as Batman in Christopher Nolan Dark Knight trilogy, telling Yahoo! Movies : “I didn’t quite nail it.” Just as Bond acolytes will never stop arguing about which actor best rocked the Walther PPK, the issue of who made the greatest ever Batman is likely to be whirling in the ether for as long as Hollywood makes superhero movies. It particularly pertinent right now, with the world set to get its first look at the new caped crusader, Ben Affleck, in the much-hyped superhero smackdown Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. So here why Bale, despite his own misgivings, will most likely be remembered as the greatest dark knight ever to stalk the rooftops of Gotham City. And why many of his rivals simply weren’t fit to wear the cape. Christian Bale: I could have been a better Batman Batman: Christian Bale Movies: Batman Begins The Dark Knight The Dark Knight Rises It hard to remember what a shock to the system Bale debut turn as Batman was in the Welsh-born actor – for better or for worse – almost single-handedly forced Hollywood to take superheroes seriously. Batman Begins arrived in cinemas at a time when studios were largely clueless as to how to realise comic book material on the big screen. It gave us the caped crusader first proper origins story, and didn’t shy away from the grim reality of Bruce Wayne angst-ridden existence. Bale gave us a Batman we could believe in, in more ways than one. Crucially the character is never overplayed: Bale may wish he had mined the horrors of the dark knight ruined soul more thoroughly across the Nolan trilogy, but Heath Ledger razor-edged Joker was always going to need a less flamboyant foil. Bale performance levels dipped slightly for the final instalment, The Dark Knight Rises , but his jaded, late-era Bats is still head and shoulders above any of his rivals. Critics always mention the silly gruff voice, yet it really just a clever way of maintaining one secret identity while scaring the bejesus out of more fragile opponents. Costume: Batmobile: Fear factor: Overall Batpower: Batman: Michael Keaton Movies: Batman Batman Returns Keaton caped crusader was widely expected to be a disaster, but the Tim Burton regular brought a kind of still confidence to his scenes as Wayne. Yet Burton decision to shoot on a studio lot, rather than Nolan real cityscapes, combined with scenery-chewing turns from the likes of Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito, these days lend the early Batman movies a pantomime air. And when Keaton steps into his “mini-Bats” outfit, he simply isn’t all that scary. Bale haters will disagree here, but who would you rather meet on a dark night? Costume: Batmobile: Fear factor: Overall Batpower: Batman: Val Kilmer Movies: Batman Forever Kilmer turn as Gotham defender coincided with Joel Schumacher assumption of directing duties, studio bigwigs having decided that Burton Batman Returns (with its missile-toting penguins and catsuited Michelle Pfeiffer) was too adult in tone for a major blockbuster. The new Bruce Wayne certainly filled his suit more impressively, but often appears to be struggling for energy levels. Then again, the dialogue probably didn’t help: it hard to get enthused when you’re trotting out lines like: “Are you trying to get under my cape, doctor?” in dodgy scenes of rooftop romance with an embarrassed-looking Nicole Kidman. Despite the best efforts of furiously freewheeling villains Jim Carrey (The Riddler) and Tommy Lee Jones (Two Face), the whole movie falls curiously flat, and Kilmer wasn’t asked back after falling out with Schumacher on set. Costume: Batmobile: Fear factor: Overall Batpower: Batman: George Clooney Movies: Batman &amp; Robin Clooney arrival in the Batcave almost killed his Hollywood career even before it got started, and little wonder. The suit is the worst yet, with Schumacher insisting on rubber Batnipples, while gorgeous George spends the entire movie with an expression of confused horror on his face, as if he just turned up to a Christian coffee morning dressed as Dr Frank N Furter from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The only good thing about Batman &amp; Robin is that it forced Warner Bros to take a completely different slant on the character, which eventually led to the Robin-less Nolan movies. Oh, and the Clooney Batmobile, which at long made for an impressive entrance. Costume: Batmobile: Fear factor: Overall Batpower: Batman: Adam West Movies: Batman: The Movie While diehards love the campy silliness, the Batman TV series and it one-off big screen transfer are probably responsible for all that ever been wrong with the caped crusader in cinema. The fact that it deliberately ridiculous doesn’t forgive the amateurishness of many of the action scenes, as typified by the early segue in which Batman and Robin are attacked by a rubber shark – which they fend off with shark repellent. Yet West, with that wonderfully stilted delivery as the dark knight, is enjoyably aware of the gilt-edged artifice of the entire affair. It a performance so good yet bad that doyen of overacting Nicolas Cage chose to channel his forebear when cast as the similarly pitched Big Daddy in Matthew Vaughn Kick-Ass.

Kurt Russell Earp is tall, straight-backed and broad-shouldered. He has tanned skin and a personality as imposing as his physique. Val Kilmer Holliday is smaller and unmistakably sickly . He has a vampiric pallor and constantly coughs, stumbles and sweats. He dying of tuberculosis, but he still the fastest gun in the west. Like Doc Holliday, I am diminished and disabled by long-term illness. Like him, I spend much of my time suffering in bed, recovering from brief exertions. But my brief exertions don't include winning the gunfight at the OK Corral or consecutive pots at poker. When people hear that the movie character I would most like to be is from Tombstone, they assume I mean Wyatt Earp. I can never understand why. Wyatt Earp is good in a gunfight – he brave and generally hits what he aims at – but he not a gunfighter in the classic sense. He no quick-draw specialist. In contrast, the outlaw Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) is a legitimate gunslinger. Ringo engineers fights he knows he will win, like a boxer hand-picking his opponents. This is why he challenges Earp to a one-on-one shoot-out. And it is why, learning of the challenge, Doc Holliday staggers from his sickbed to take Earp place. Reading on mobile? Click to view For me, what follows is one of the most inspiring sights in cinema: the disabled supporting character fighting through his physical limitations to easily defeat an enemy who has the film great able-bodied hero completely outclassed. When Ringo thinks he sees Earp approaching, he is thrilled and eager to fight. When he recognises instead the pallid, infirm figure of Doc Holliday, he is suddenly terrified and stammers that their previous disagreements don't amount to a real quarrel. ""I was just foolin' about,"" says Ringo. Reading on mobile? Click to view ""I wasn't,"" says Holliday, and his eyes announce that the reckoning has arrived. It the coolest a chronically ill character has ever looked on screen. By this point, Wyatt Earp would already have been dead. Growing up, I often fantasised about being one of the heroes of the old west played by Clint Eastwood or John Wayne, but I eventually realised that, if I became one, I'd have to give up my favourite pleasures. Rooster Cogburn and The Man With No Name are not noted for their sensitivity to the arts. But if I became Kilmer Doc Holliday, I could be a legendary gunslinger and still be a bookworm. Holliday excels at the rough business of gambling and gunfighting, more so than any of the rough men around him, and yet he is educated and elegant. He speaks Latin, quotes Coleridge and plays Chopin on a saloon piano, sending his adoring girlfriend (Joanna Pacula) into erotic reveries. Reading on mobile? Click to view And this is another reason I want to be him: women want to be with him. It is hard to feel attractive when you are chronically ill. Kilmer Doc Holliday makes chronic illness look good. He a sexy, Keats-esque consumptive. I dream of being a sexy, Keats-esque consumptive. As a long-term invalid, it the strongest look I can reasonably hope to achieve. Many seriously ill movie characters are inspirational, but the inspiring message they usually send to seriously ill viewers is that we can learn to make peace with our awful situations or perhaps overcome them enough to get a degree or fight a court case. As wish-fulfilment goes, that pretty tame. Doc Holliday proves you can be chronically ill and still be an action hero.

42,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/16/marlon-brando-monster-sabotaged-my-film-island-of-dr-moreau,"He was one of cinema biggest stars, but Marlon Brando behaved like a “monster” and seemed “hell-bent on sabotaging” The Island of Dr Moreau , one of his last films, according to its screenwriter. When Ron Hutchinson was asked to work on a film with The Godfather star in he could not believe his luck. In adapting HG Wells science fiction novel about a renegade scientist who creates an island of monsters, Hutchinson would be working with one of his great acting idols, as well as the acclaimed director John Frankenheimer. There was the added bonus of spending a couple of months on the Great Barrier Reef and in the rainforests of northern Australia. But when Hutchinson joined the production team, he witnessed “one of the legendary movie disasters of all time”, describing it as a train wreck”. He was shocked to discover that Brando – who he claims arrived on location “weighing about pounds” – would not recite words written for him: “He wanted to improvise it all.” And Brando would rarely emerge from his trailer: “They were flying in these hapless [studio] executives to try to beg him to come out of his damned trailer. “Brando was only answering the door when the pizza man came. This was the best news that the pizza-makers of Cairns, this small town, had ever had because Brando was consuming industrial quantities of pizza while ruminating on what the hell he was going to do when he had to face the cameras. I think there might have been an existential terror there.” Hutchinson, who was born in Northern Ireland, is an Emmy award-winning screenwriter, Olivier-nominated playwright and was writer-in-residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company before making the move to work in Hollywood. His five previous collaborations with Frankenheimer included the Emmy-winning Against The Wall , about the Attica prison riot, starring Samuel L Jackson. Next month, Oberon Books will publish his memoir, Clinging to the Iceberg: Writing for a Living on the Stage and in Hollywood . In it he has relived a painful chapter of his career – so painful that he has never watched The Island of Dr Moreau since its completion. In an interview with the Observer , Hutchinson recalled that he had been working with the director Stephen Daldry on a revival of his Royal Court hit, Rat in the Skull, when he was contacted by Frankenheimer. Although Brando revolutionised acting with his mesmerising performances in classics such as A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront , he was known to loathe producers, directors and even acting. Frankenheimer had warned Hutchinson that there were difficulties with working with Brando, sending over some initial footage shot after he replaced the original director, Richard Stanley. “He [Frankenheimer] said: ‘Take a look at these [tapes] before you actually commit.’ They showed Brando sitting in a hammock with literally the smallest person who ever been measured by scientists, the actor Nelson De la Rosa who was just under inches tall. “Brando absolutely fell in love with this guy. He put him on his chest in the hammock and sang ‘Frog Went A-Courting’ to him. There was minutes of that. John said: ‘This is all I can persuade Brando to do.’ ” Hutchinson writes in his book: “By this stage of his life Brando, playing the God of Moreau island and emerging as the God of the production, was way beyond bored with the making of movies. Overweight, unprepared, mocking, dismissive, on the razor edge where caprice becomes malice, the case for the prosecution is therefore easily made. He was indeed here to sabotage this movie.” He continues: “Brando placed a kitchen colander on his head, slathered himself in sunscreen, fell in love with Nelson, retired to his trailer and refused to leave it.” Looking back, Hutchinson now notes the irony that, in making a film about an island of monsters, everybody in the movie turned into a monster: “Everybody behaved monstrously to each other.” He was shocked to discover the “poisonous” relations between Brando and most of the other actors. Careful about mentioning names, Hutchinson refers to incidents including a “prohibition” on one actor being allowed to handle a gun – even one that fired blanks. There was such intense hatred that the executives eventually “threw up their arms” and asked the actors to film “a one-man show” that would be stitched together in post-production: “It was an island of crazy people – an awful experience.”",745
43,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/22/hollywood-hello-new-scarface,"Hollywood is planning to produce a new version of Scarface , the classic gangster story brought to the big screen in different forms by Howard Hawks in and Brian De Palma in . The new version, which is being bankrolled by studio Universal, is being touted as neither a remake nor a sequel. Instead it will borrow the common elements of the earlier films, both of which centred on a violent outsider intent on pursuing his own twisted take on the American dream who infiltrates a criminal operation with ruthless determination and swiftly becomes its kingpin. Paul Muni took the central role of Italian newcomer Antonio ""Tony"" Comonte in the Scarface, a tale of warring Chicago gangs which teamed Hawks with the legendary producer Howard Hughes. Al Pacino played Cuban drug baron Tony Montana in De Palma remake, which was critically panned on release but has gone on to be one of the most iconic films. Pacino line ""say hello to my little friend"" is one of the most famous quotes in film history and is also the highest-selling mobile phone ringtone of all time. The storyline for the film, which also starred Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, was spawned by Cuban leader Fidel Castro decision in to allow some Cubans – many of them prisoners and people with mental health issues – to leave the nation in what was known as the Mariel boatlift . Universal is currently pursuing writers for its new version, which is at an early stage of development and has the Scarface Martin Bregman on board as producer.",264

Universal has been working on a second remake of the classic gangster story since at least with Harry Potter David Yates at one point in talks to direct. The studio now looks set to hire Chilean film-maker Pablo Larraín, best known for the Oscar-nominated political drama No , to oversee the new iteration. Paul Muni took the central role of Italian newcomer Antonio ""Tony"" Comonte in the Scarface, a tale of warring Chicago gangs which teamed Howard Hawks with the legendary producer Howard Hughes. Al Pacino played Cuban drug baron Tony Montana in Brian de Palma remake , which was critically panned on release but has gone on to be one of the most iconic films. Producers of the new version plan to cast an ""authentic Latino who is bilingual and bicultural"" as the new Scarface, sources tell The Wrap. The character will retain the first name Tony but pick up a new surname. Both previous films centred on a violent outsider intent on pursuing his own twisted take on the American dream, who ruthlessly infiltrates a criminal operation and swiftly becomes its kingpin, a scenario that is likely to be retained. The new version will be set up as a ""mythic origin story that explores where Tony physical and emotional wounds come from and how they shaped him as a man"", reckons The Wrap. Larraín, who also won the Art Cinema award at Cannes for No, was reportedly picked for his connection to the material and ability to bring an outsider perspective to the story. The director, whose four feature films also include Fuga , Tony Manero and Post Mortem , will be working in Hollywood for the first time if he signs on the dotted line. Both previous iterations of Scarface retain their place in film history. De Palma take, written by Oliver Stone, features the iconic line: ""Say hello to my little friend"" and proved to be Michelle Pfeiffer breakout performance. Hawks' version was banned in a dozen US states for its violent scenes. Martin Bregman, who produced the Scarface, remains on board the new remake.",373
45,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/20/walter-murch-sound-god-particle-fever,"o relax, Walter Murch likes&nbsp;to sit in front of the TV. With a stopwatch. Counting the number of times a politician blinks as they give a speech. ""I'm just fascinated by it, clinically,"" he says. ""I'll be: 'Can you believe it? He blinked times a minute!' Our normal rate is about and so clearly something is at odds, mentally."" The record holder is still Dan Quayle (""a phenomenally high blink&nbsp;rate""). For Murch, the eyelids are the window to the soul. Or, at least, to the&nbsp;synchronicity of brain and mouth. He tests the suppleness of his editing muscles by running a clip of film, noting where the actor blinks, then re-playing and halting at exactly that frame (there of them a second). This is the key to his technique. If the actor is good enough, they will blink in&nbsp;character; this dictates where cuts should come. ""When I can't do that any more that will tell me I have to&nbsp;hang up."" It has worked so far. He tested the theory on THX and American Graffiti and The Godfather , then doubled up on sound design and picture editing for The Conversation – perhaps his key work, the one with the sound engineer hero, the plot that hinges on inflection . He won his first Oscar for audio on Apocalypse Now (remember how the helicopter blades blur into the syncopated chop of the ceiling fan ), won a couple more for work on The English Patient (Murch is a serial monogamist, loyal to Lucas and Coppola, Minghella and Mendes). Yet his status as the most legendary editor working today (sorry, Thelma Schoonmaker ) has not made him lofty. He turns up early for our interview, in a&nbsp;reconditioned school bus outside Sheffield station, to quietly promote Particle Fever , a documentary about the search for the Higgs boson. He is politely warm, speaks in perfectly composed and lucid sentences, pre-editing for you, knowing where the cuts should come. At first it is unnerving; you worry it is squashing spontaneity. Then&nbsp;you twig: if he hasn't said this before, he is still able to utter it with more off-the-cuff eloquence than most of us could manage after a lifetime of&nbsp;sweating. He has had a lifelong interest in particle physics , he says, an eagerness for ""a grand unified theory that will explain what you had for breakfast this morning and what the breakfast was made of and what you're going to do later. I personally don't think that will ever happen. I think it a box within a box within a box. The interesting thing is&nbsp;the pursuit itself and what emerges out of the side of it."" In between winning three Oscars , having four children, keeping bees and&nbsp;studying music, Murch recently investigated new links between the architecture of the Pantheon, the work of Copernicus and the origins of heliocentrism in western astronomy. Does the grand globe at Cern inspire him in the same way as the dome in Rome? Does he feel these days we are less awed by the beauty of science? ""Those who know the maths are bedazzled by the beauty of it. But, for the average person, it harder to grasp.&nbsp;Whereas in the century there was a general passionate interest in science because it seemed to follow common sense."" Artist as he is, Murch takes a scientific, nearly surgical approach to his work. He edits upright, and writes lying down, verticality being apparently more conducive to firing up that part of his mind. At he still puts in days. Like the physicists in the film, he is a pioneer, hungry for discovery, worrying at the limits. Aural literacy, he thinks, is still in its infancy. ""This is&nbsp;a brand new experience in human culture. Early on in the evolution of cinema sound a number of theorists recognised this power and said the ability to manipulate sound creatively will redeem us from the chaos of shapeless noise. You think how long painting has been around and how that&nbsp;has shaped how we see the world over thousands of years; we're at the beginning of this process."" Evidence can be found in the limited range of our oral vocabulary. ""There are many, many nouns for the act of looking – a glance, a glimpse, a peep – but there no noun for the act of listening. In general, we don't think primarily about sound. So I have a different perspective on the world; I can construct soundscapes that have an effect on people, but they don't know why. It a sort of subterfuge. When you photograph something it a direct appeal to their most conscious sense and so they know that they're being a affected by what they see. Sound kind of sneaks in the side door."" Partly, he thinks, it because of ""a limitation of our biological evolution"". Though our eyes are expressive, our ears are simply trumpets. ""What if we had eyes like from Star Wars? Just fixed discs with no shift in them. And our ears were like dogs' ears that could prick up or flop down or turn sideways and focus.

46,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/09/world.news1,"The German film director and photographer Leni Riefenstahl, who has died aged will be remembered for two innovative, visually eloquent and lavishly funded documentaries, Triumph of the Will and the two-part Olympia The former, a monumental, hypnotic account of the massive Nazi party rally in Nuremberg which glorified Nazi pageantry and deified Adolf Hitler, earned her a place in film history and the status of a post-war pariah. She was the first female film director to attract international acclaim, but her career was curtailed by public, industry and official antipathy owing to her status as ""Hitler favourite film-maker"". Both Triumph of The Will and Olympia are permeated by Riefenstahl intense feeling for the expressive power of bodies in motion, whether they be marching Nazis or high divers. Born in Berlin, Riefenstahl achieved fame as a ""free"" dancer in the style of Isadora Duncan, touring Europe by the age of and gaining employment with Max Reinhardt. Her film ambitions were prompted by ""father of the mountain film"" Arnold Fanck Mountain of Fate, starring the Tyrolean outdoors hero Luis Trencker. The ""mountain film"" genre use of cinematic technique - filters, special film stock, slow motion - to endow magnificent natural scenery with dramatic stature - provided her with key elements of her towering visual style and fostered her technical skill. She made contact with Trencker. He later became her lover and, in her antagonist when he published a fake intimate diary purportedly by Hitler mistress Eva Braun. This claimed that Riefenstahl had also been Hitler mistress- an allegation she furiously denied but which pursued her for life. But it was Fanck, a geologist, adventurer and technical perfectionist, who became her film mentor, writing The Holy Mountain as her film debut. This film, opens with Riefenstahl performance of a dance of the sea on a rocky outcrop in Heligoland amidst crashing waves. According to her memoirs, this was what made Hitler an admirer. It was later to prompt Siegfried Kracauer to discern, in its ""idolatry of glaciers and rocks"", a proto-Nazi irrationalism where modern viewers are likely to see only kitsch. More mountain films followed including a starring role in the genre finest and most successful entry, The White Hell of Piz Palü co-directed by Fanck and G W Pabst. Fanck had surrounded himself with the best cameramen available - the Freiburg school, including Hans ""The Snowflea"" Schneeburger, another of Riefenstahl lovers. Many of them would work for her after she began directing with The Blue Light in Riefenstahl would frequently invoke The Blue Light as evidence of the non-political nature of her talent. A fairytale starring the director as an outcast young woman luring young men to their deaths with her secret cave of blue crystals in the Tyrolean mountains, it was co-written by the leftwing Jewish intellectual and theorist Béla Bàlazs. After the war, she would conceive of the outcast heroine loss of her ""magic cavern"" as a metaphor for her own disenfranchisement as a film-maker. Riefenstahl had the first of her numerous meetings with Hitler when she was summoned to a resort near Wilmershaven while she was en route to Greenland to star in Fanck SOS Eisberg which was made simultaneously in an American version by Tay Garnett. She had, by her own account, been ""mesmerised"" by his oratory at a Nazi meeting at the Berlin Sportpalast some months earlier, prompting her to write an admiring letter requesting a meeting. In when the Nazis had consolidated their grip on power with the March elections and begun their official anti-semitic campaigns with boycotts of Jewish businesses and the introduction of the Aryan clause, which banned Jews from working in the film industry, Hitler commissioned her to make Victory Of Faith, a record of the Nazi Party rally. Rediscovered in the early this precursor to Triumph Of The Will reveals a clumsiness, both in the construction of the film and in the Nazi staging of the rally, highlighting the achievements of the later film. In Triumph of the Will, feature-film techniques - including rhythmic montage to Herbert Windt Wagnerian score - produce moments of extraordinary cinematic power. Its immediate purpose was to demonstrate a united monolithic Nazi party in the wake of Hitler murder of Ernst Röhm and his SA streetfighters. In its cinematic mastery, though, it renders the event and the film indivisible. It remains the most vivid proof of the German Marxist critic Walter Benjamin contention that ""fascism is the aestheticisation of politics"". How much was later staged or reshot became a hot issue in debates about its value as a film or its status as either documentary or propaganda. Riefenstahl suggested, somewhat naively, that its lack of a voiceover disqualified it from being propaganda, but when the historian Erwin Leiser intercut sequences from the film with harrowing concentration camp footage in his documentary Mein Kampf, she sued the producers over breach of copyright. Her undoubted masterpiece, the two-part Olympia (Festival Of Nations/ Festival Of Beauty) was commissioned by the International Olympic Committee but funded by the Nazis to foster the image of a modern, powerful Germany abroad. With a vast budget, the greatest technicians of the day, state-of-the-art equipment, unprecedented access to the sporting events in the Berlin Olympia stadium and an artistic brief, Riefenstahl produced a lavish hymn to sporting prowess and physical beauty and strength. Conceiving of the athletes in a prologue as classical divine messengers, Riefenstahl mythologising imagery - at its most lucidly effective in the marathon and high-diving sections - extended, uncomfortably for the Nazi racist ideology - to the great American black athlete Jesse Owens. Owens broke Olympic records and the Nazi leader could neither bear to shake hands or be photographed with him. After Riefenstahl had spent nearly two years editing miles of raw footage, it was premiered with Hitler as guest of honour on his birthday in Riefenstahl toured with Olympia, following its success at the Venice Biennale, throughout Europe then to the United States, where she was accompanied by, among others, her old friend Ernst Jaeger. He was ex-editor of the influential Film-Kurier and had lost this post when he had defied an order by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels to divorce his Jewish wife. They arrived in the US in the immediate aftermath of the November Kristallnacht, ""the night of the broken glass"" when Nazi youths murdered and brutalised Jews throughout Germany. Riefenstahl was met with hostility - only Hal Roach and Walt Disney publicly received her. Jaeger stayed behind in the US to pen a series of articles for the Hollywood Tribune accusing her of having been not only a mistress to Hitler and Goebbels - with whom she professed to have a relationship of mutual hatred, although none of this appears in Goebbels' journals - but also to Hermann Goering. This character assassination was, for Riefenstahl, a taste of things to come. During the war, Riefenstahl became, briefly, a war correspondent. She witnessed the massacre of Polish civilians by German soldiers in the town of Konskie and a German soldier snapshot of her horrified reaction was later used in a counter-productive blackmail attempt. Retreating to Spain to pick up an old project - the opera film Tiefland (Lowlands) - Riefenstahl devoted the rest of the war to this troubled project. It remained unfinished in when she was arrested at her chalet in Kitzbühel in the Tyrol by US soldiers, including the screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who had been involved in organising the pre-war Hollywood protests against her. Schulberg echoed Jaeger condemnation, dubbing her contemptuously ""the Nazi pin-up girl"". Riefenstahl had never been a Nazi party member and was cleared of active involvement by a de-Nazification tribunal, although, after three years house arrest, she was declared a Mitläufer or fellow traveller, which disbarred her from ever seeking public office. Cherished film projects - notably her version of Penthesilia - were never completed, but Riefenstahl managed to rescue her mistreated Tiefland footage from the French authorities. Jean Cocteau much admired Tiefland, comparing its imagery to Breughel, and insisted it be shown at the Cannes film festival of which he was president. In the postwar film world those interested in Riefenstahl work divided into apologists or detractors. In the National Film Theatre invited Riefenstahl to give a lecture, its then controller Stanley Reed declaring that ""Satan himself is welcome at the NFT if he makes good pictures"" but the invitation was hurriedly withdrawn. In the Riefenstahl discovered Africa and reinvented herself as a still photographer. When her project about the slave trade, Black Freight, was stillborn, and after recovering from a serious car accident, she sought out the Nuba tribe in southern Sudan. The Nuba were, in the cut off from the outside world and they fascinated Riefenstahl with their athletic bodies and developed artistic practices: the Nuba consider their bodies the highest form of art, their faces a blank canvas for elaborate painted masks. At the age of Riefenstahl lived with the Nuba for six months and the relationship produced metres of (unseen) film footage and two successful and accomplished books of photographs, The Last of The Nuba followed in by People of Kau. In the she added Leni Riefenstahl Africa and Vanishing Africa. The Last of The Nuba occasioned Susan Sontag famous essay Fascinating Fascism. This attacked Riefenstahl for a perceived continuity of her ""fascist aesthetic""- of her obsession with strength, youth and beauty - across her career. Riefenstahl photographed the ill-fated Munich Olympics for the Sunday Times as well as a spread featuring Mick and Bianca Jagger, but she remained a difficult figure for Germans. She was an unwelcome reminder of a past, which many, who continued to thrive in less visible sectors than the film industry (and less visibly within that industry), had disavowed. Riefenstahl successfully took the filmmaker Nina Gladitz to court for suggesting in a documentary that she had promised the Gypsy extras from concentration camps who worked on Tiefland their freedom, when many later died in the camps. This was the most damaging post-war accusation against her. A major revival of interest in Riefenstahl occurred in the early International stars flocked to her birthday party, Helmut Newton photographed her for Vanity Fair, her long-awaited memoirs were translated into English as The Sieve of Time, and Ray Müller documentary TheWonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Rienstahl featured a lengthy, intensive interview with the defiantly unapologetic nonagenarian. Despite taking refuge in underwater photography with her companion Horst Kettner (Riefenstahl, remarkably, took up diving in her she remained a magnet for controversy to the last. The first German commercial exhibition of her photographs in Hamburg in drew fierce protests as did a retrospective of her films at the Filmmuseum in Potsdam in The final controversy occurred in when Riefenstahl revisited the Nuba. Since the tribe has been in armed struggle with the Arab-orientated Islamic government in Khartoum, which has been accused of conducting genocide. Riefenstahl agreed to visit only those areas controlled by the Sudanese government, thus attracting the criticism that she was acting as a figleaf for a repressive regime. Interest in Leni Riefenstahl life and works shows no sign of abating. Both Madonna and Jodie Foster had vied for the rights to Riefenstahl memoirs since the early Foster is now set to produce, direct and star in a Riefenstahl biopic. One wonders what lessons the film will draw from a life, whose greatest achievements survive time sieve by pre-empting the gigantism of the Hollywood megabuck movie, the mythic use of the camera in sports coverage and even the primacy of the ""image"" in politics. The films remain as a challenge to historians and cinephiles alike, posing difficult questions about the relationship between the century greatest tragedy and its most powerful art form. · Leni (Hélène Bertha Amelia) Riefenstahl, film-maker, born August died September",1965
47,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/08/its-a-mistresspiece-the-14-hour-film-about-forgotten-female-directors,"perfect lockdown gift has landed, one which might have sounded daunting in ordinary times: a documentary about female directors, which goes live from next week on BFI Player . This glorious enterprise unearths footage from some of the greatest movie-makers of this century and the last – all of them female. At the same time, the BFI is showing of the hundreds of films mentioned, so that viewers can enjoy full immersion over weeks, possibly awarding themselves a degree in, say, The Cinema of the Second Sex afterwards. Narrated by women including Tilda Swinton and Thandie Newton, Women Make Film – A New Road Movie Through Cinema is the latest encyclopedic romp from the Northern Irish film historian and documentary-maker Mark Cousins, who previously directed the television series The Story of Film: An Odyssey, in The new documentary will be released in palatable chunks over five weeks from May, and aims to open a conversation on the lost legacy of women behind the movie camera. The film does not waste time wondering why women have been sidelined by mainstream cinema – we knew the answers to that long before #MeToo. This is not about slamming the patriarchy, but a joyous trip through women work on screen, puckishly curated into chapters on different themes including openings, interiority, meet cutes, sci-fi, tone, love, death, editing and musicals. The clips cover six continents, decades and directors, from the studio owner Alice Guy Blaché early silent work to the Russian director Kira Muratova, populists Dorothy Arzner and Kathryn Bigelow in the US, and China Wang Ping under Mao. Cinephiles previewing at festivals have been gobsmacked by the sheer quality of work excavated from previously obscure film-makers. “For years when I was visiting a country, I’d ask who their great female directors were,” says Cousins, citing his encounter with the Sri Lankan director Sumitra Peries, who was astonished to be contacted. “Yes, we’re interested in her life, but in this film we’re interested in her camera, her images, her social and psychological ideas.” Cousins started thinking about missing female films in the when he curated a season of great documentaries, and realised that he had included only one by a woman, Barbara Kopple powerful mining story Harlan County, USA “Afterwards I thought, that gunk.” (Gunk is a Northern Irish term meaning “a shock of disappointment”.) Cousins gathered a team at Hopscotch Films in Glasgow to rectify the situation. It began as an unpaid labour of love, years in the making. “I wanted to be an ally with the great female activists who are pushing for change in the film industry today.” Women Make Film is helping spawn a movement to bring this lost archive into the light, reminding older feminists of the days when the green spines of Virago books rescued early writers from obscurity and changed the literary canon. The charity Birds’ Eye View, which promotes female-made films , will launch an extension of its # ReclaimTheFrame scheme, which previously ran in cinemas countrywide. Under lockdown # ReclaimTheFrame will attempt to #ReclaimTheCanon, hosting weekly home “viewing parties” for each section of Cousins’ documentary, with Facebook Live responses from women filmmakers and debates afterwards. Birds’ Eye View director, Mia Bays, says: “This is the best possible primer for a conversation which will have film-makers talking about who they love, and their new discoveries, and also about how cinema is controlled: who decides what shown, what archived, what digitised for a new audience.” Angry young women: how radical, female film-makers defined the spirit of Birds’ Eye View has been working with the doyenne of feminist cinema, Prof Laura Mulvey of Birkbeck University, famed for creating the term “the male gaze”. At years old, she is taking to Facebook Live debates with alacrity. Cousins cites as one of his inspirations the first Women Film Event at the Edinburgh film festival in which was curated by Mulvey and others. As their blurb then said: “A festival of men films would be simply absurd. It because so few women have been able to make films that this festival exists.” Mulvey is delighted that her work is being continued. “With this new compilation, an exciting staging post has been reached in the long process of recovery,” she says. “The amazing extent of the work, with over a thousand clips, has the potential to bring women directors out of gender categorisation and into film history as such. But it also offers an unprecedented opportunity to enjoy women cinematic vision and reflect on the way women have seen and indeed made the world through film – a source of wonder and of speculation!” Even those immersed in female film, such as Bays, have been surprised by the archival finds, such as Germany Pale Mother by Helma Sanders-Brahms, which is also on BFI Player. “It the best film about war I’ve seen, a remarkable work. A mistresspiece!” The documentary is also a resource for film schools wishing to explore horizons beyond the Scorsese-Tarkovsky-Fellini triangle. Cousins has already heard from universities who want to use his film, and he hopes even more material will emerge. “We have to ask, what do we not know? The old canon was a kind of comfort blanket which we need to throw off.” Women Make Film has sold around the world to mainstream television broadcasters from the US to China to Spain – but not yet in the UK, although BBC Four has declared an interest. “Maybe we’re having an intellectual and cultural lockdown, post-Brexit, as well as a physical lockdown,” laughs Cousins. But despite losing a cinema release, he points with hope to the “sense of community in lockdown, the sense of something bigger. People are looking for a bit of structure in their lives, something affirmative.” Women Make Film launches on the BFI Player, Curzon Home Cinema and Blu-ray on May.",975
48,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/11/tom-hardy-warrior-thug-hollywood,"he bed has been removed from the Soho hotel room where rising British film star Tom Hardy and I are to meet, leaving a vast carpeted brawling area. We could, I think as I await his arrival, mix it up like Oliver Reed and Alan Bates did in Women in Love , or as Hardy and his screen brother Joel Edgerton do at the denouement of his unremittingly butch new mixed martial arts film Warrior . Hardy jogs into the room flanked by minders as if he entering a boxing arena. How about sorting things out mano a mano, I suggest? It could make both our careers. He could get the slightly bonkers rep Christian Bale has had ever since he bawled out his director of photography on set, which might help establish him in Hollywood (Hardy current focus). And getting bopped by an angry thesp adds lustre to a hack CV. Hardy looks game: “What – out the back?” No, here. “Absolutely!” Really, I was only joking. For one thing, Tom Hardy would batter me. You just have to look at his improbably pronounced neck muscles to realise that. Hardy settles on the sofa and pours coffee. For the next hour he writhes and giggles as he chats about his career prospects. As he pours, I ask him about a line in the production notes for Warrior, in which he plays a troubled war vet who, for reasons that made sense when I saw the film, has to cage-fight his brother in a martial arts contest at the drama climax. It Raging Bull meets Rocky meets Rolf Harris song of fraternal solidarity, Two Little Boys . But one passage troubled me: “The son of a Cambridge academic father, Hardy is the first to admit that prior to Warrior he was not a fighting man and not intimately familiar with ‘alpha male territory’.” Surely this makes his dad sound like a mortar board-sporting ponce rather than what he was, namely, the esteemed writer of gags for comedian Dave Allen who, along with his artist mother, brought up their only child (Tom, born September in the genteel London suburb of East Sheen. “The point is my father not really into throwing his fists. He got lightning wit, backchat and repartee to get himself out of a scrap – and nothing else. My father came from an intellectual and studious avenue as opposed to a brawler avenue. So I had to go further afield and I brought all kinds of unscrupulous oiks back home – earless, toothless vagabonds – to teach me the arts of the old bagarre .” Hardy – with his machine-gun verbosity, rococo vocabulary and the non-remote possibility that he could turn at any moment and chuck me out of the window – is an appealingly odd interviewee. He pronounces bagarre with an exaggerated angry French accent. Then he repeats it. “ Bagaaaaarrrre ! It got me into an enormous amount of scrapes and trouble – and eventually I ended up in Warrior, where he [his character Tom Conlon] does it for a living.” Excellent, but there another point. The idea he not familiar with alpha male bagarre stuff is barmy. Let review. After graduating from Richmond Drama School and the Drama Centre London , Hardy got a role in the second world war mini-series Band of Brothers and in made his film debut in Ridley Scott war thriller Black Hawk Down , neither of which was a paean to non-violence. He was Bill Sikes, the notoriously violent Dickensian hoodlum, in the Oliver Twist mini-series. He played Handsome Bob, the member of a gang called the Wild Bunch in Guy Ritchie film RocknRolla . He played Charles Bronson, the notoriously violent prisoner in the eponymous film (for which he won best actor at the British Independent Film Awards). He played Heathcliff, the notoriously violent male love interest in the TV mini-series of Wuthering Heights . He played a London gangster in a TV mini-series called The Take . True, he did play a relatively weedy-looking homeless alcoholic in the TV adaptation of Stuart: a Life Lived Backwards (for which he was Bafta-nominated), but that the exception that proves the rule. He currently filming Christopher Nolan The Dark Knight Rises in which he plays stupendously muscled and unpleasantly brutish super-villain Bane. Apparently, Hardy current muscles weren’t built to play a cage-fighter in Warrior – that was a year ago – but to play Batman latest nemesis. Hardy undeniable buffness, though, may have cost him work. There was a hideous career-defining moment in when he was turned down for the role of Mr Darcy in a film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Hollywood producer Stacey Snider took him aside during auditions. “She said: ‘Honey, women over the world have a picture of what Darcy is and I’m afraid you’re just not it.’ That really hard for an actor.” So why the CV teeming with thugs, not one of whom would make their girlfriends daisy chains or, you know, happy? “It boils down in brutal honesty to necessity. But there is another component to those characters, which is a kind of legitimate or illegitimate suffering in their psyche, which is more exciting to me. I’m playing people who have an obstacle to overcome and struggle to express that.” This is all great stuff about an actor motivation, but I’m thinking, as I take notes, of what would happen if I suckered him with the old “Look over there!” and, while he turned, chucked the coffee in his face. No, he’d probably recover and still do me in. There a lot of conflict in Warrior, in which the public school-educated, fetchingly plump-lipped, lavishly pecced Englishman is cast as a troubled Pittsburgh-based Irish-American bruiser. Hardy is a surly, almost non-verbal wounded beast of an ex-GI and ex-wrestler with a Freighted Family Back Story who returns to the ring to express himself in the only way he knows. Gradually we unpick That Back Story and learn that his alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) destroyed the family with his drinking. But let Hardy relate the plot as he lies on his back. “Is it Rocky meets Raging Bull? Yes, if you want that hyperbole. But it a very intricate family drama, to the backdrop of an MMA (mixed martial arts) movie – which is fantastic.” Hardy takes a sip of coffee, rolls on the sofa and stares at the ceiling. This would be the moment to take him. Cushion over the face. Shimmy down the fire escape. PR minder finds him later, open-mouthed and dead. Perhaps not. He sits up again. “In hindsight I can see it great drama, but when you’re getting your teeth kicked in and eating endless chicken and broccoli, you don’t really care.” What does he mean? To look like a cage-fighter he had to eschew carbohydrates and eat chicken and broccoli incessantly. That wasn’t all. “I did two hours boxing a day, two hours muay thai, two hours ju jitsu followed by two hours choreography and two hours of weightlifting seven days a week for three months. So come on! You have to really want to do that, so it was a challenge.” Hardy Warrior regimen put on of muscle. But what interests him is not the fighting style per se, but its spiritual dimension. “Ju jitsu is very Buddhist. All that we fear we hold close to ourselves to survive. So if you’re drowning and you see a corpse floating by, hang on to it because it will rescue you.” Hardy rolls over to look at the ceiling. “But the embrace is about the breaking of cycles. The film asks: ‘What part do we play in those cycles and what is fated?’ That very Greek.” But his character has to be beaten virtually to death by his brother to be spiritually reborn, which is very Christian. Let not go nuts about Warrior spiritual dimension. It mostly blokes tearing lumps out of each other in a cage encircled by people screaming for blood and/or death. “Again, that Greek,” says Hardy. “It the gods who have decided to sacrifice this man. But let watch. Who do you want to win? Red car? Or blue car? Let watch two people kick the shit out of each other.” Hardy sits up, giggles, pours more coffee. And that why people will pay to see Warrior? “Well, it a normal human impulse. Let watch Ricky Gervais and Danny Dyer in a ring with bottles.” Hardy may have had too much coffee. “I would pay good money to see those guys carve each other up. If they didn’t, I’d be trying to instigate it: ‘Go on fellas, let turn the lights off, feel our way around this ring.’” Why Gervais and Dyer? “You aren’t telling me you wouldn’t watch that – that a good pay-per-view fight. That would get a lot of people interested in MMA. Actually, it not MMA – MMA has rules. We shouldn’t have rules. We should just say: ‘You guys go at it, see what happens.’ I don’t want to say fuck ‘em, but fuck ‘em. I don’t care. Their children I care about. And for that reason we can’t let it happen.” Hardy laughs at his own compunctions about Gervais and Dyer children, if indeed they have any. “My inside voice says, ‘Yeah!’ but in reality we don’t let Gervais and Dyer hurt themselves. Why? Because we’re not God. We shouldn’t play with people lives like that.” He lies back on the sofa again and giggles wildly. No more caffeine for you, laughing boy. “Funnily enough for a film about MMA, Warrior scored very highly with people who don’t care about fighting,” he says. In my screening, I tell Hardy, there were lots of women alternating between whooping during the fight sequences and weeping over the poignant ones. “I welled up when Paddy [Nick Nolte, Tommy dad] has the relapse and gets drunk.” Did that resonate for him because he was a drunk and a drug addict? Hardy collapsed in Soho after a crack binge in “That was a lesson to me, I was fed to the Kraken and popped out the other side. In death I was reborn, just like in the film. Because I’d always been this adrenal kid and then I became a little shit. I’m not now.” He eight years clean. What did playing opposite a recovering alcoholic mean to him? (Nolte is also a recovering alcoholic.) “I guess I’m more sympathetic to the alcoholic. I know in recovery that you are entirely responsible for your actions but I also know you’re not the same person you were yesterday. Paddy doesn’t think he the same person he was yesterday, he doesn’t even understand that person.” So how can you be responsible? “Well, that the conundrum of the human condition, isn’t it? Deciding when you’re responsible is hard fucking work, man.” I look at Hardy chest, thinking that it a shame he wearing a long-sleeved top. Otherwise we could spend the rest of our allotted time reading his tattoos. Like Groucho Marx tattooed lady Lydia, he has an encyclopedic chest , though in his case it is an encyclopedia of his private life. His marriage to Sarah Ward is commemorated by the tattoo “Till I die SW” and a dragon on his left arm. Below it are the words “figlio mio bellissimo” commemorating his son Louis birth three years ago with ex-girlfriend Rachel Speed. On his back is the word “Charlotte” marking his relationship with fiancee actor Charlotte Riley , whom he met on the set of Wuthering Heights. There are many others (his torso is a big canvas) but Hardy isn’t going to talk me through them today. Instead, he wants to discuss his career. Warrior may be the film that breaks him in the US. “I hope. The question I ask myself every seconds is: ‘Are we going to have a crack at the investment market in acting and producing and directing, or am I going to be a jobbing actor who struggles to work on theatre or TV?’ I just want to know.” The likelihood is the former. He impressed in Christopher Nolan Inception as Eames, the inept British conman, partly because of his delivery of lines such as: “Great. Thank you. So, now we’re trapped in Fischer mind battling his own private army, and if we get killed, we’ll be lost in limbo ‘til our brains turn to scrambled egg.” He has also wrapped another clutch of films, including This Means War in which he plays a CIA agent who fights with his colleague (Chris Pine) over Reese Witherspoon. Having looked at online images of Chris Pine, my money on Hardy to win. He also currently to be seen in the film adaptation of John Le Carré Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. According to Xan Brooks Guardian review , Hardy “raises the roof as Ricki Tarr, the tale bullish rogue element”. That sounds about right: Hardy is not so much raging bull as bullish rogue. He loving the work, but wilting under the PR demands, the poor flower. “I’ve got about six or seven of these things going on at the moment so I’m being pulled from pillar to post.” But in the process he become so Hollywood he too big to be photographed by the Guardian. “Look, there an abundance of exposure when you start working in American films. Inevitably you become a brand and that has to be controlled.” We thought the refusal to be photographed was because his body looks different now he is shooting as Bane from how it looked in Warrior, the film he promoting today. “Well, I’m metamorphosing my character as best I can and because I’m not Christian Bale, it difficult.” I tell Hardy of a charming story in which Christian Bale, who plays Batman opposite Hardy in The Dark Knight Rises, told an interviewer he would like to “piss on the shoes” of a critic who had commented on his “trademark weight-loss” acting. “Why would he want to piss on anyone shoes?” asks Hardy sensibly. Maybe he could ask him on the set of The Dark Knight Rises when they’re not comparing muscles. “Don’t think I’ll be doing that.” Does he feel as sensitive as Bale to journalists writing about his body? “Not yet. At the moment it a way of identifying me. That how people initially identified Christian Bale. Who he? He that bloke whose ribs you saw. Then he that bloke who swore at the DOP. Then he that bloke who was great in The Machinist .” His PR minder enters, insisting we wind up. Maybe he will feel differently when he is more established. Maybe you’ll be duffing up interviewers and ruining their footwear. “Maybe. I have to make my bones with Hollywood to get in. And when I do maybe I’ll metamorphose from Mr Muscles or whatever it is I am now and become an irascible tosser.” I’m just glad to get out of the room with dry shoes and no black eye. Warrior goes on general release in the UK on September. This article was amended on September because when Tom Hardy said he had been training two hours daily for his role in Warrior, he meant the combat sport “muay thai”, not the fruity cocktail known as “mai tai”. This has been corrected.",2570
49,film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/24/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-adopted-daughter-memoir-allegations,"Woody Allen has written that he “would welcome Dylan [Farrow] with open arms if she’d ever want to reach out”, in his recently published memoir Apropos of Nothing. In extracts published in the New York Times , Allen writes: “One of the saddest things of my life was that I was deprived of the years of raising Dylan and could only dream about showing her Manhattan and the joys of Paris and Rome. To this day, Soon-Yi [Previn] and I would welcome Dylan with open arms if she’d ever want to reach out to us as Moses [Farrow] did, but so far that still only a dream.” In Allen was accused of sexually assaulting, in the same year, his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, then aged seven, by Farrow adoptive mother Mia Farrow, after he separated from her. Allen denies the allegations, and was not charged after two investigations into them. Dylan Farrow renewed the allegations in and has been consistently supported by the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, Allen and Mia Farrow son, while her older adopted brother Moses has defended Allen, principally via a lengthy blogpost published in . Apropos of Nothing was originally due to be published by Grand Central, an imprint of Hachette, but the book was dropped after staff protests and criticism from both Dylan and Ronan Farrow, the latter of whom is also published by a Hachette imprint, Little Brown. Apropos of Nothing was subsequently published on Monday by Arcade. Why Woody Allen publisher was wrong to drop his memoir In other extracts, Allen says of Dylan that he “quickly found this tiny baby girl adorable and found myself more and more holding her, playing with her, and completely falling in love with her, delighted to be her father”. He also specifically denied accusations of “improper” behaviour towards her and that he put his head in her lap. “While Mia had gone shopping, after explaining to everyone that I had to be watched carefully, all the kids and the babysitters were in the den watching TV, a room full of people. There were no seats for me, so I sat on the floor and might have leaned my head back on the sofa on Dylan lap for a moment. I certainly didn’t do anything improper to her.” Allen also rebuffed suggestions that he worked with Harvey Weinstein , writing: “I would never have allowed Harvey to back or produce a film of mine because he was a hands-on producer who changed and recut a director movie. We never could have worked together.” Allen also had a riposte for actors who publicly announced they regretted working with him and were donating their salaries to charity. Allen wrote: “This is not as heroic a gesture as it seems, as we can only afford to pay the union minimum, and my guess is if we paid more usual movie money, which often runs quite high, the actors might have righteously declared they’d never work with me but would possibly leave out the part about donating their salary.” He added: “Off the record, I had envisioned a little more peer support, nothing overwhelming, perhaps a few organised protests, maybe some irate colleagues marching arms linked, a little rioting, perhaps a few burned cars. After all, I had been a member in good standing of the creative community and was certain my predicament would infuriate my union brethren and fellow artists.”",570

They are critically endangered, their numbers in the wild have fallen by over the past years owing to chytridiomycosis – a fungal disease caused by the chytrid fungus, which has attacked amphibians across the world. Lemur leaf frogs are now known to occur naturally only in a single site in Costa Rica, on the edge of the Veragua rainforest reserve in Limón province. This suggests that these tiny, charismatic frogs have either undergone a significant range contraction or occur more sparsely than previously recorded. However, they have been introduced to new sites in the region, where they appear to be thriving. The chytrid fungus is widespread in Costa Rica and represents perhaps the greatest threat to amphibian survival. Bristol Zoological Society (BZS) is working with a number of organisations on this project, to determine the population size of these distinctive frogs and to discover more precisely where they are living. We are also working on pond restoration and creation efforts to increase breeding habitat for the animals in their natural range. The study has won praise from the naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, who said: “I wholeheartedly support the campaign to save the lemur leaf frog. It is, after all, one of the world most unusual and rarest amphibians – and it is in real trouble.” Bristol zoo gardens (BZG) is home to a breeding group of lemur leaf frogs, held in a sterile, climate-controlled “amphipod”. The zoo also manages the European conservation breeding programme for the species. BZS is working on the conservation of threatened lemurs and the ibis bird in north-west Madagascar, as well as the protection and restoration of their habitats. The blue-eyed black lemur from the Sahamalaza peninsula is considered the most charming of the lemur species, the males being jet-black and the females golden-orange, with both sexes having striking turquoise eyes. Bristol zoo gardens is home to a pair of blue-eyed black lemurs. The species is critically endangered in the wild owing to hunting and habitat loss. It was listed as one of the world most endangered primates between and and numbers in the wild are unknown. BZS is working to safeguard this species in a number of ways. Our project is determining the most effective way to replant forest in the lemurs’ habitat to increase forest cover in the national park. In addition, we are working alongside like-minded organisations to improve the livelihoods of rural poor Malagasy communities. We also contribute to maintaining a population of the blue-eyed black lemur in human care. These actions have helped to secure the future of the species in Madagascar, and, while still heavily conservation-dependent, the blue-eyed black lemur was removed from the list of the world most endangered primates in As one of the world most beautiful and majestic animals, giraffe are instantly recognisable and loved the world over. But this striking creature is quietly slipping towards extinction. Kordofan giraffe are one of nine giraffe subspecies and, despite being one of the most populous giraffe in zoos, the situation facing them in the wild is challenging. As such, the conservation of Kordofan giraffe is becoming a race against time. It is estimated that as few as Kordofan giraffe may be left in Africa, out of a total giraffe population of about Poaching, bushmeat trade and habitat loss are the main threats to their future in the wild. BZS leads a vital conservation project for the species, which focuses on protecting one of the few remaining populations of Kordofan giraffe left in the wild, in Bénoué national park, northern Cameroon. A team of BZS conservationists has been working to determine how many giraffe remain in the park. Drones have enabled eco-guards to search larger areas in order to establish giraffe population numbers and locations. More recently, motion-activated camera traps have also been set up to monitor wildlife in the area. Wild Place Project, the sister site of Bristol zoo gardens in south Gloucestershire, is home to three reticulated giraffe. BZS recently launched a flagship conservation project in Equatorial Guinea to protect one of Africa most threatened great ape species, western lowland gorillas. The society conservation team is collaborating with the University of the West of England to create a research base in Monte Alén national park, where conservationists from the zoo will focus their efforts on protecting western lowland gorillas. The exact number of western lowland gorillas in the wild is not known because they inhabit some of the densest and most remote rainforests in Africa. In it was estimated that about individuals lived in the Monte Alén national park, but today numbers are unknown. The species is threatened with habitat loss from deforestation and the threat of bushmeat hunting. As a result, researchers estimate that gorilla numbers overall have declined by more than over the last to years. Their dwindling numbers are reflected across five other African countries: Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo and Gabon. Recent estimates suggest as few as remain across these countries. Bristol zoo gardens is home to seven western lowland gorillas. The zoo is part of a European breeding programme for the species, to ensure there is a strong population in human care. The UK only native freshwater crayfish is a keystone species of our aquatic habitats. It is globally endangered throughout its range, both within mainland Europe and the UK. Since the there has been more than a decline in numbers in south-west England owing to habitat fragmentation, pollution and, most importantly, the introduction of the non-native invasive signal crayfish. The latter carries crayfish plague, a disease which is lethal to the native UK species. For more than years, our dedicated team have been breeding white-clawed crayfish in a hatchery at Bristol zoo gardens. It was the first white-clawed crayfish hatchery in the UK; however we are now working with partners to establish others throughout the south-west. Once hatched, they are reintroduced into safe ark sites across the south-west by our native species conservation team. The species is extinct in the wild. BZS has five individuals, two at Bristol zoo gardens and three at Wild Place. There are only about Socorro doves in captivity worldwide. The last known sighting of a Socorro dove in the wild was in Now there are just birds in eight UK zoos. Coordinated conservation breeding of the birds by zoos such as Bristol zoo and Wild Place has prevented the total extinction of the species. Socorro doves were native to the island of Socorro, miles off the western coast of Mexico. They died out after falling prey to a rising number of feral cats in the area. In addition, overgrazing by sheep destroyed much of their forest floor habitat and the birds were hunted by humans for food. This species of spider is a critically endangered and is only found in one valley on one of the Desertas islands near Madeira. Despite having an impressive body size and being the largest known wolf spider, very little is known about this species. Bristol zoo gardens’ successful breeding programme has seen the creation of nine new captive populations set up at other institutions from spiders reared at Bristol zoo. In the wild, the absence of any native terrestrial mammals means this spider is a top predator in its habitat. Although its major prey consists of other invertebrates, such as beetles, millipedes and woodlice, adults have also been seen predating on juvenile lizards. The small valley where the spider lives is covered by a fast growing grass, Phalaris. The colonisation of this grass in the Vale da Castanheira was hidden for some years owing to the presence of rabbits that grazed and controlled the spread of the plant. With the eradication of rabbits from the valley in the Phalaris grass lost its main predator and now proliferates. This grass appears to not only displace many other native plants, but also many of the native animals. It covers the surface of the soil and rocks, making the microhabitats below the rocks harder to access for the spiders. Bristol zoo and its invertebrates team were the pioneers for the world first captive breeding programme for Desertas wolf spiders in and there has since been the hatching of more than spiderlings. Now a European breeding programme for the species is being coordinated by B ZS, combined with a conservation action plan to help save the species in the wild. We also work closely with the Madeiran government, which is leading on the habitat restoration aspects of this conservation programme. The wild population of endangered African penguins has been monitored by BZS and partner organisations for years in South Africa. The global population of African penguins fell by between and leaving approximately to breeding pairs in the wild. The main causes of this decline are overfishing off the coast of South Africa and Namibia, and climate change. BZS African penguin conservation project consists of three main areas. The first is to work with a local rehabilitation centre, the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB ), to rescue, rear and release abandoned penguin chicks once they reach a healthy weight at fledging age. The second is to participate in a long-term monitoring programme of wild African penguins at a key breeding colony on Robben Island. As part of this, we are trying to understand how immature African penguins choose breeding sites – something that is currently very poorly understood. Third, the project aims to analyse the movement and ecology of penguins at all life stages, to better understand how they choose and use breeding colonies. A dedicated team track penguins to understand how they are affected by threats such as overfishing and climate change, allowing BZS to provide crucial data to the South African government. This data can be used to determine the best size and location for future marine protected areas. There are seven recognised species of Cercocebus mangabeys. All are at high risk of extinction and all are relatively understudied, owing to the fact that they are usually found deep in the forest, in regions that are difficult to access and not often visited by tourists or researchers. BZS is monitoring the population of the Sanje mangabey monkey and working to understand the threats to their survival in the Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. Mangabeys are highly terrestrial, spending large amounts of time on the forest floor rather than up in the trees. The species is listed as endangered owing to declining population size, habitat loss and forest fragmentation. In the last years it is estimated that the population has declined by leaving a total of only monkeys remaining in the world. BZS is working with local and international stakeholders to ensure the protection of the Sanje mangabey and its remaining habitat. The beautiful yet elusive Negros bleeding-heart dove is among the rarest bird species in the world and is native to the Western Visayas islands of Negros and Panay in the Philippines. The Philippines are considered to be one of the world diverse biodiversity hotspots because of the amazing variety of wildlife there. Yet of the country forests have already been cut down, mainly to grow crops. So-called for their bright, blood-red chest patch, these birds need high-quality, low elevation tropical forests to survive. Now it is feared there are fewer than pairs of Negros bleeding-heart doves left in the wild. As such, this species has been categorised as critically endangered on the IUCN red list of threatened species. BZS has been working in the Philippines since and, last year, was able to catch a rare glimpse of the bird and record it on film for the first time in more than a decade. By conserving this species and its habitat, a number of other rare and threatened species are also benefiting, including Visayan warty pigs (left). Wildlife Animals Conservation features",1994
1,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/15/rspb-flooded-with-reports-of-birds-of-prey-being-killed,"The RSPB has been “overrun” with reports of birds of prey being illegally killed since lockdown began. Police have been called out to investigate multiple cases of raptors being shot, trapped or suspected of having been poisoned, with the charity saying most incidents were on or close to sporting estates managed for game bird shooting. The RSPB has logged at least potential offences – more than one a day on average – since lockdown began on March, including confirmed shot birds of prey and birds submitted for further postmortem analysis after suspected illegal killing. Birds targeted in the last six weeks include hen harriers , peregrine falcons, red kites, goshawks, buzzards and a barn owl. On March, a buzzard was found with its wing fractured by gunshot at Shipton, near York. The buzzard was rehabilitated by a local wildlife expert and recovered. Over the Easter weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds with shotgun pellets in its body. The following weekend, the naturalist and broadcaster Iolo Williams recovered a red kite in Powys which had been shot dead. Two further red kites were also reported shot in the area. In Scotland, the police are investigating several raptor persecution cases and reports of the use of illegal traps on grouse moors. Mark Thomas, head of UK investigations for the RSPB, said: “Since lockdown began, the RSPB has been overrun with reports of birds of prey being targeted. It is clear that criminals on some sporting estates, both in the uplands and lowlands, have used the wider closure of the countryside as an opportunity to ramp up their efforts to kill birds of prey. “Spring is the time when birds of prey are most visible and therefore vulnerable, as they put on courtship displays, build nests and find food ready to breed. The criminal actions are targeted and malicious in nature, taking out birds before they have the opportunity to breed, often in areas where they have previously faced persecution.” Supt Nick Lyall, the head of a national police and policy group tasked with tackling raptor persecution , said he was “sickened” by the number of cases in recent weeks. “Lockdown has been seen as a green light by those involved in raptor persecution offences to continue committing crimes, presumably in the belief that there are fewer people around to catch them doing so,” he said. “I remain grateful to everyone involved in investigating these crimes, and thankfully in the vast majority of the cases I am aware of, it looks like some really good lines of inquiry are taking place which should lead to arrests and interviews.” Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, said: “Any confirmed reports of raptor persecution are cause for concern. The incidents specified near Leeds and York ... [by the RSPB] are clearly not on grouse moors, while reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public. Estates across the country have reported a number of raptors including peregrine, merlin and hen harriers nesting and living on those landscapes. “We condemn any illegal activity and Moorland Association members have signed up to a cross-sector zero tolerance approach to wildlife crime.” Dr Ruth Tingay of Raptor Persecution UK and co-founder of Wild Justice , said: “The reported surge really shouldn’t come as any surprise. Birds of prey have been ruthlessly targeted on many game-shooting estates for decades; lockdown simply provides the criminals with more opportunity to pursue their targets with little fear of detection or consequence. “The big question remains the same – lockdown or not: when will this government acknowledge the scale and extent of the problem and hold these shooting estates to account? Wilful blindness can no longer be tolerated.”",644
2,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/14/greta-thunberg-cnn-coronavirus-town-hall-climate-change,"Shortly after CNN announced yesterday that climate activist Greta Thunberg would join a panel of experts discussing the coronavirus, the backlash began. “What place does Greta Thunberg have in this town hall?” asked the New York magazine journalist Yashar Ali. On the other side of the spectrum, Fox News pundits and Donald Trump Jr also took issue with Thunberg name being on that list. It is worth noting that Don Jr frequently takes the stage with no qualifications other than being his father son. Fox News, meanwhile, has a rotating roster of non-experts debating people whose job it is to know better than them. We’ve seen climate-deniers who debate scientists about climate change; unlicensed health practitioners who debate what actual doctors have told us ; and commentators who have compared Black Lives Matter to the KKK debate civil rights activists on what racism is. We are hardly in expert-land here. Even if letting “people with a view” challenge experts can sometimes produce good debate, it can also run the risk of creating a false equivalence between the two. Greta Thunberg says it 'extremely likely' she has had coronavirus So is CNN right to have Thunberg on? Thunberg is hardly a coronavirus expert, but she is world-renowned climate activist – and has already spoken about how the pandemic should inform our response to climate justice in a post-pandemic world . Thunberg activism also gives her an undeniable platform which she has used to inform people about the pandemic . After showing mild symptoms of in late March after a trip around Europe, Thunberg chose to quarantine away from her family for two weeks and encouraged other young people to do the same. Without Thunberg, the panel for “Coronavirus Facts and Fears” – which includes the CNN broadcasters Dr Sanjay Gupta, and Anderson Cooper, Kathleen Sebelius, the former health secretary; and Richard Besser, the former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director – has an average age of That makes sense: expertise often takes years to accrue. But it also makes sense to have a young voice that carries influence on the panel. Young people are less vulnerable to the virus and so they might take its risks less seriously, but they also tend to be more socially agile. Studies analyzing the early outbreak of Covid suggest that about four in five people who have spread the disease probably didn’t know they had the virus. In other words, young people could play a vital role in preventing its spread. Some have suggested that sexism might play a role in the shock people are expressing at Thunberg appearance. It is hard to imagine the same outrage if the journalist Chris Cuomo – who was recently diagnosed with – was invited to the town hall. In fairness, Cuomo had proof that he had the coronavirus. But isn’t that kind of the point? Most people who aren’t wealthy or famous simply aren’t able to get tested – certainly many young people won’t. Medical guidelines also encourage people without severe symptoms not to get tested. Viewed in this light, Thunberg – a young person who showed symptoms that weren’t bad but decided to stay home anyway – has one of the most important experiences on the panel.",541
3,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/14/country-diary-from-garlic-mustard-through-a-glat-to-the-pulse-of-spring,"There are rights of way, and there are rites of way. One thing leads to another, and this way began with garlic mustard and led into the white pulse of May. Garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata , has toothy, nettle-like leaves that have a garlicky pong when crushed; its stem is topped with a cluster of X-shaped flowers, each of four petals, that look like little white butterflies. Along the byways, now that the blackthorn has passed, garlic mustard is joined by the true wild garlic, cow parsley, hogweed, stitchwort and a blast of hawthorn may blossom. In the brightness of the hedge whites, a way through them was almost invisible. Between the lane and a field with a public footpath across it, the glat – a gap in the hedge – was no right of way but a narrow squeeze up a medieval bank through the hedge dark interior. Within the closing chamber – as if the trees were growing to heal a wound – was a grey feather, lodged in a blackthorn fork. Dropped by a wood pigeon, or left by an unknown agent of secret entrances, the feather felt preternatural, a quiet yet uncannily resonant object. Around the glat, the impenetrable boundary of field maple, ash, hazel, blackthorn and hawthorn was busily throwing leaves and flowers into the sunlight. Inside was thorny shadow and a feather marking a place in a processional ritual. Through the portal and out in the field, a path wavered towards the wood edged with may blossom and then to deeper green. In the wood, ways of deer, badger and fox wound upwards through thorn to what remained of the original hilltop after quarrying was abandoned a century ago. Here was an ancient crab apple tree the size of a small house, in full, lunar flower, a slight breeze drifting white petal rain into the crawl space under its boughs. This was the flowering henge at the end of the processional journey into the pulse of spring. The way out to a lane beyond the wood was a struggle, but there, in another hedge, another place, another time, the flowers like little white butterflies were as sharp as garlic, as keen as mustard.",369
4,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/13/farmers-lose-legal-challenge-derbyshire-badger-cull,"Farmers have lost a challenge to the government cancellation of the badger cull in Derbyshire in a high court ruling that has been welcomed by wildlife groups. A judicial review of the environment secretary decision to halt a planned expansion of the cull to Derbyshire last September brought by the National Farmers’ Union was dismissed on all grounds. The NFU said the cancellation of the Derbyshire cull came after the intervention of Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson partner and a patron of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation , who was briefed by Dominic Dyer, head of the Badger Trust, three weeks before the government U-turn. The extension of the cull to Derbyshire was widely opposed by wildlife groups including the Badger Trust and Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, which is running the largest badger vaccination programme in the country . Derbyshire Wildlife Trust argued that a cull would jeopardise its work with landowners and farmers, in which badgers were vaccinated in The government licensed the killing of badgers in in culling zones from Cornwall to Cumbria, its seventh successive year of badger culling, a controversial destruction of a legally protected wild species which has done little to slow the spread of TB in cattle. While pro-cull farmers, supported by figures from the Animal and Plant Health Agency, claimed that of new cases of bovine TB in Derbyshire were caused by badgers, Derbyshire Wildlife Trust used freedom of information requests to reveal that this figure was based on the personal judgment of vets called to new outbreaks. Peer-reviewed scientific literature estimates that badgers contribute of outbreaks in cattle. Most bovine TB within herds is transmitted by other cows who are not diagnosed with the disease by the notoriously unreliable cattle tuberculin skin test. The National Farmers’ Union said it was “shocked and dismayed” by the high court decision. Stuart Roberts, deputy president of the NFU, said: “The direction by the secretary of state was made against absolutely all the scientific and veterinary advice and left farmers in the Derbyshire area, who met all the licence criteria, completely devastated. Many of them had seen this cull as their last hope at dealing with this awful disease which has been devastating their cattle herds and crippling their business for years. “It remains our view that it simply cannot be lawful for the government to make policy up on the hoof.” After an independent review by Sir Charles Godfray into bovine TB policies, the government recently conceded that the mass culling of badgers was not a long-term solution to reducing bovine TB. It announced a new emphasis on vaccinating cattle as well as badgers against the disease, which scientists hailed as “a seismic shift”. Dominic Dyer, chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: “The Badger Trust is delighted to see the prime minister took note of the concerns we raised in our open letter to him on why a badger cull licence should not be issued in Derbyshire in “The high court judgment shows he was highly engaged in the decision-making process to withhold a cull licence in Derbyshire and we are pleased to see that the judge accepted his intervention in this case was both legitimate and lawful. “In its verdict on the Godfray review, the government has made it clear that it wants to find an exit strategy to badger culling based on badgers and cattle vaccination combined with improved TB testing in cattle and tighter biosecurity and movement controls. The Badger Trust fully supports this change of policy.”",584
5,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/13/russian-supertrawlers-off-scottish-coast-fears-uk-marine-life,"A fleet of Russian supertrawlers has been spotted fishing off the coast of Scotland in a protected area, raising concerns by environmentalists over the impact of industrial vessels on marine life in UK waters. The vessels, among the largest trawlers in the world, have spent “significant time” fishing in the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, a British special area of conservation (SAC), according to data analysed by Greenpeace. The vessels, each more than metres long and capable of processing hundreds of tonnes of fish every day, are believed to be targeting blue whiting, a pelagic species that lives in midwater. The fleet is operating legally, according to the Scottish government. The area, to the west of the Shetland Islands, is within waters shared by the UK and the Faroe Islands . It is managed jointly, but governed by the Faroese government under a special treaty. Its designation as a SAC by the European Union does not prevent commercial fishing in the area. Environmentalists condemned the “destructive” practices of supertrawlers and called on the UK government to better regulate their activities to protect marine life. Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, called for a ban on supertrawlers in UK marine protected areas. He said: “While the UK is in lockdown, this fleet of destructive supertrawlers has been plundering fish from what is supposed to be a protected area in UK waters. “The intensity with which these vast ships fish is not compatible with a healthy ocean. They drag vast nets, up to one-mile long, in their wake hoovering up fish and other marine life and disturbing the entire water column.” “If the UK government wants to be taken seriously as a world leader in marine protection, it must do more to restrict and regulate the activities of the international supertrawler fleet, and support small scale, sustainable fishing communities.” Lockdown measures and a drop in the fish export market due to coronavirus has forced many of the UK small scale, more sustainable fishing boats to tie up at port, unable to work. The Wyville-Thomson ridge SAC sits on reef at the edge of Scotland continental shelf. It “supports diverse biological communities representative of hard substratum in deep water” according to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee . John Hourston, a volunteer with the Blue Planet Society, which campaigns against the bycatch of dolphins in fishing nets, called for better monitoring and more regulation. “These factory trawlers can stay at sea for weeks. They have nets with mouths that could swallow three jumbo jets. The problem is dolphins feed on these fish in midwater when they aggregate to spawn,” he said. “You drag a net through these fish and you will also catch what is feeding on them. There needs to be more regulation around the pelagic supertrawler fleet.” Studies have shown high bycatch rates of dolphins in pelagic trawlers targeting blue whiting and European sea bass in the Bay of Biscay. A spokesman for the Scottish government said while the SAC was within the UK continental shelf limit of the seabed, the responsibility of the waters above it were joint. “We are aware that a multinational fleet is legitimately operating in shared waters under the Faroese government authority, and has done for a number of years,” he said. “They are targeting blue whiting, a species caught with nets that do not contact the seabed.” It was monitoring the vessels, via marine protection patrol boats and electronic surveillance, “to ensure there are no infringements and none have strayed into areas that are exclusively within UK fishery limits or the Scottish zone”, he said. Earlier this month, conservation groups expressed alarm over lower levels of surveillance of fishing operations during the coronavirus pandemic after lobbying from fishing fleets. Several companies operating the trawlers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",635

Unusual fluctuations in demand have led to an increase in food waste generated in takeaway outlets rising from an average of per restaurant per week in normal times to – equivalent to a rise for the sector as a whole since lockdown, according to the research. Nearly half the restaurants surveyed – – said they throw most food waste into the bin. Despite the erratic ordering patterns, consumers appear to be wasting less than they usually would in their own homes, the report found. Britain fondness for takeaway food has created a business that has ballooned in the past decade. In recent weeks, the options have expanded as many restaurants have turned to takeout and delivery as an alternative to closure. The research from the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA) and the Just Eat app was conducted in two waves – the first in December followed by a second phase in April to understand how attitudes towards food waste had changed due to the pandemic. Stopping the rot: the fight to save fresh food The data found that a total of worth of takeaway food was thrown away in the UK. Of that, worth of food waste was binned in takeaway kitchens while households chucked out in wasted takeaway food in the entire year. The data reveals that last year an average household threw away nearly one tenth of takeaway food they ordered. One in four consumers said that more than half the time when they ordered a takeaway, they had leftovers that ended up in the bin. The most common cause was unintentionally ordering larger portions than they needed, with rice and chips the most wasted foods. The data also reveals that in restaurants, by far the most common reason for food being thrown away was overproduction of meals Cooked meals were the most thrown away food type, ahead of unused fresh ingredients.",341

Scottish Power plans to “repower” Scotland oldest commercial windfarm as part of a scheme to develop a clean energy cluster in central Scotland capable of supplying homes with green electricity. Green energy could drive recovery with boost The windfarm cluster is expected to create jobs at its peak, and long-term jobs, to help the UK emerge from the worst economic downturn in years while taking steps to meet its climate goals. Separately SSE and Equinor have revealed plans to use the Port of Tyne to host the operations base for the world largest offshore wind development , which will create permanent jobs and support a local supply chain industry based on clean energy. Alok Sharma, the secretary of state for business, said projects like the Dogger Bank offshore windfarm will be “a key part of ensuring a green and resilient economic recovery as well as reaching our target of net-zero emissions by “Renewable energy is one of the UK great success stories, providing over a third of our electricity and thousands of jobs,” he said. Keith Anderson, the boss of Scottish Power, told the Guardian that work to upgrade Scotland first commercial windfarm, Hagshaw Hill, will come alongside two separate agreements to buy two nearby development projects to create a clean energy cluster in South Lanarkshire totalling The project is part of the company plan to develop of onshore wind power and battery storage after the government u-turn on support for onshore wind , but could also play a role in resuscitating the UK economy following the coronavirus pandemic, he said. “We’re kickstarting as many of our projects as we can so they are ready to help boost the economy when the pandemic ends. Not only do these projects help funnel money back through the supply chain and into jobs but they also make sure that the economic recovery is based on sustainable investments,” he said. Polluter bailouts and lobbying during pandemic Ignacio Galán, the chairman and chief executive of Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, said it is essential the financial recovery is aligned with climate goals. “As we begin to emerge from the coronavirus crisis, investment in green infrastructure can quickly be delivered, creating jobs and offering immediate economic and environmental benefits. This will help to support the UK overall recovery at this critical time,” he said. In the north-east, the Dogger Bank offshore wind development is on track to bring investment to the UK “at a challenging time for us all”, according to Stephen Bull, the head of Equinor UK business, which runs the site. Equinor and SSE Renewables picked the Port of Tyne to host the operations hub through a competitive tendering process, following its overhaul to prepare for a surge in demand from windfarm developers. “The north-east has a strong industrial heritage and a supply area that stretches north and south of the River Tyne,” said Bull. “The Port of Tyne is clearly well set up to attract other clean energy investment which we hope will complement our activities.” Matt Beeton, the Port of Tyne chief executive, said the project is “extremely important for the wider region” in terms of spurring economic benefits for the local supply chain and creating employment opportunities . “This announcement is a huge step towards developing a cleaner future for the Port, the region and for industry in the north-east,” he said.",588

9,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/15/us-national-park-reopenings-coronavirus,"On Wednesday, Zion national park in Utah, one of the most popular natural attractions in the US, received its first visitors in more than a month as the Trump administration continued its push to reopen the nation outdoors as well as it cities and businesses. 'Please don't come': calls to close US national parks over virus fears More than people poured into the beauty spot from numerous states. Yet the phased reopening of America national parks has raised concerns about exacerbating the spread of and endangering the residents of rural towns located near parks. “We don’t want the parks to become super spreaders,” said Timothy Whitehouse, executive director of the non-profit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “These communities simply do not have the capacity or the medical infrastructure to deal with an outbreak.” In March and April, as the pandemic raged, parks remained open. During that time, NPS employees complained of large crowds gathering at parks as visitors ignored social distancing rules. Many parks shuttered on an ad hoc basis. National parks such as the Everglades, Smoky Mountains and Glen Canyon have already reopened, though in most cases visitors’ centers and campgrounds are still out of commission. The popular Canyonlands and Arches national parks in Utah, as well as Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks in Wyoming, will also partially open this month. In Springdale, a town of located next to Zion national park, there is a delicate attempt to balance economic and health interests . In late March, Mayor Stan Smith drafted a letter asking the interior department to close Zion to visitors in order to protect the town. As was the case across the country, pressure from local stakeholders, not guidance from the federal government, was the impetus for the closure. Facing the prospect of reopening, “the retired community is concerned about an influx of tourists bringing in the virus into town, while the business community says this is the time when we should be making money”, Smith told the Guardian. His municipal budget is almost entirely dependent on tourism. “Some say it too soon, especially those residents that are very concerned about our vulnerable populations,” said Mayor Emily Niehaus of Moab, Utah. Her town is located near Arches and Canyonlands national parks. “Others are saying not soon enough. But we need a target date.” Niehaus has expressed support for the safe reopening of the parks – meaning, for instance, that visitors will have to follow physical distancing guidelines – at the end of May. “The gateway communities have to understand the numbers [of coronavirus infections] are going to go up,” the Yellowstone park superintendent, Cameron Sholly, told the Billings Gazette, acknowledging the potential spread of in communities adjacent to parks. There has been no word on whether parks have enough protective equipment, and they are not looking into strategies such as timed entry, said Kristen Brengel, a senior vice-president at the National Parks Conservation Association. “At parks like Zion, where you already had a lot of overcrowding, this could occur quite quickly.” In an email, the park service said it is “working service-wide with federal, state, and local public health authorities to closely monitor the pandemic and using a phased approach to increase access on a park-by-park basis”. Alan Morgan, chief executive officer at the National Rural Health Association, had a bracing prognosis for the communities located near national parks. “The story of now shifts to rural America.” ﻿",572
10,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/08/climate-change-global-heating-extreme-heat-humidity,"Intolerable bouts of extreme humidity and heat which could threaten human survival are on the rise across the world, suggesting that worst-case scenario warnings about the consequences of global heating are already occurring, a new study has revealed. One billion people will live in insufferable heat within years – study Scientists have identified thousands of previously undetected outbreaks of the deadly weather combination in parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, South America and North America, including several hotspots along the US Gulf coast. Humidity is more dangerous than dry heat alone because it impairs sweating – the body life-saving natural cooling system. The number of potentially fatal humidity and heat events doubled between and and are increasing in both frequency and intensity, according to the study published in Science Advances. In the US, the south-eastern coastal corner from eastern Texas to the Florida Panhandle experienced such extreme conditions dozens of times, with New Orleans and Biloxi, Mississippi the hardest hit. The most extreme incidents occurred along the Persian Gulf, where the heat and humidity combination surpassed the theoretical human survivability limit on occasions. Doha, the capital of Qatar, where the World Cup will be held in was among the places to suffer – albeit briefly – these potentially fatal weather events. The ominous findings come as something of a surprise to scientists, as previous studies had projected such extreme weather events would occur later in the century , mostly in parts of the tropics and subtropics where humidity is already a problem. “Previous studies projected that this would happen several decades from now, but this shows it happening right now,” said lead author Colin Raymond from Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory . “The times these events last will increase, and the areas they affect will grow in direct correlation with global warming.” Earlier studies relied on average heat and humidity recorded over several hours in large areas, whereas the Columbia team analysed hourly data from individual weather stations, allowing them to pinpoint short, localized incidents. In dry conditions, the body sweats out excess heat through the skin, where it then evaporates away. Humidity impedes evaporation, and can even halt it completely in extreme conditions. If the body core overheats, organs can quickly begin to fail and lead to death within hours. Meteorologists measure the heat/humidity effect on the so-called “wet bulb” Centigrade scale, known as the “heat index”, or “real-feel” Fahrenheit readings in the US. Even the strongest, well-adapted people cannot carry out ordinary outdoor activities like walking or digging once the wet bulb hits though most would struggle well before that. In theory, humans cannot survive above on the wet bulb scale – the peak suffered in small areas of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, according to the study. Slightly less extreme but more frequent outbreaks were detected across India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, north-western Australia, and coastal regions along the Red Sea and Mexico Gulf of California. “We may be closer to a real tipping point than we think,” said co-author Radley Horton. Air conditioning should help mitigate the impact for some people in rich countries such as the US and Qatar, but longer enforced periods indoors could have devastating economic consequences, according to Horton. Nor is air conditioning an option for most people in the poorer high-risk countries where subsistence farming remains common. Kristina Dahl, a climatologist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US, said the new paper shows “how close communities around the world are to the limits”.",584
11,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/08/sea-levels-could-rise-more-than-a-metre-by-2100-experts-say,"Sea-level rise is faster than previously believed and could exceed metre by the end of the century unless global emissions are reduced, according to a survey of more than specialists. Based on new knowledge of climate sensitivity and polar ice melt, the experts say coastal cities should prepare for an impact that will hit sooner than predicted by the United Nations and could reach as high as metres by “A global sea-level rise by several metres would be detrimental for many coastal cities such as Miami, New York, Alexandria, Venice, Bangkok, just to name a few well-known examples. Some may have to be abandoned altogether as they cannot be defended,” said co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. In the worst-case scenario – with rising emissions and global heating of above pre-industrial levels – the study estimates the surface of the world oceans in will be between and metres higher than today, which would potentially engulf areas home to hundreds of millions of people . By contrast, if humanity succeeds in cutting carbon dioxide and holding the increase in temperature to the rise would be a more manageable metre. The figures for both pathways are more pessimistic than those outlined by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), which predicts the worst possibility is a rise by The gap reflects advances in climate science and differences in approach. The IPCC works largely through consensus among scientific working groups, which tends to produce relatively conservative estimates. By contrast, the new survey – published in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science – aggregates the views of specialists, who were chosen because they have published at least six peer-reviewed papers on the subject in major academic journals. As a result, the predictions are more representative of a range of views in the field. The higher estimates highlight growing concern about the world two biggest ice sheets, in Antarctica and Greenland. Satellite data and on-the-ground measurements show these regions are melting faster than most computer models predicted. Many of the scientists said there was now greater understanding of the risks posed by marine ice-cliff instability, which can lead to the collapse of ice shelves. The study was led by scientists at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore with support from seven research institutions across the world, including Durham University in the UK, Tufts University in the US and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. The lead author, Prof Benjamin Horton of the university Asian School of the Environment, said the research aimed to condense the growing mass of academic studies about sea-level projections into a simple overview. “It is useful to survey leading experts on the expected sea-level rise, which provides a broader picture of future scenarios and informs policymakers so they can prepare necessary measures,” he said. The authors said the results showed how much warming – and sea-level rise – could be avoided if governments fulfilled their Paris climate agreement promises to cut emissions of the gases that are heating the planet. Most countries are far off reaching their goals. “Like in the Covid pandemic, timing is critical to prevent devastation. If you wait until you already have a serious problem, then it is too late. Unlike with corona, sea-level rise cannot be stopped for many centuries or even millennia once ice sheets have been destabilised past their tipping points,” Rahmstorf said. The coronavirus pandemic has temporarily slowed the discharge of carbon dioxide and methane because there are fewer cars on the road and industrial activity is lower. The International Energy Agency projects global fossil fuel emissions will decrease by this year. But, without deeper structural changes, the reduction is likely to be temporary and will make little difference to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The Met Office predicted on Thursday carbon dioxide measurements at the Mauna Loa measuring station would rise parts per million this year. “Although emissions are reducing this year, this does not mean the build-up of in the atmosphere will reverse – it will just be slightly slower” the Met Office chief forecaster, Richard Betts , said in a blogpost . “An analogy is filling a bath from a tap – it like we are turning down the tap, but because we are not turning off the tap completely, the water level is still rising.”",730
12,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/07/promiscuous-treatment-of-nature-will-lead-to-more-pandemics-scientists,"Humanity “promiscuous treatment of nature” needs to change or there will be more deadly pandemics such as warn scientists who have analysed the link between viruses, wildlife and habitat destruction. Deforestation and other forms of land conversion are driving exotic species out of their evolutionary niches and into manmade environments, where they interact and breed new strains of disease, the experts say. Coronavirus: 'Nature is sending us a message’, says UN environment chief Three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it is human activity that multiplies the risks of contagion. A growing body of research confirms that bats – the origin of Covid – naturally host many viruses which they are more likely transfer to humans or animals if they live in or near human-disturbed ecosystems, such as recently cleared forests or swamps drained for farmland, mining projects or residential projects. In the wild, bats are less likely to transfer the viruses they host to other animals or come into contact with new pathogens because species tend to specialise within distinct and well-established habitats. But once land is converted to human use, the probability increases of contact and viruses jumping zoonotically from one species to another. As natural habitats shrink, wild animals concentrate in ever smaller territories or migrate to anthropogenic areas, such as homes, sheds and barns. This is particularly true of bats, which feed on the large number of insects drawn to lamplight or fruit in orchards. Two years ago, scientists predicted a new coronavirus would emerge from bats in Asia, partly because this was the area most affected by deforestation and other environmental pressures. One of the authors, Roger Frutos, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Montpellier, said multiple studies have confirmed the density and variety of bat-borne viruses is higher near human habitation. “Humans destroy the bats’ natural environment and then we offer them alternatives. Some adapt to an anthropomorphised environment, in which different species cross that would not cross in the wild,” he said. With deforestation and land-use change, you open a door Habitat destruction is an essential condition for the proliferation of a new virus, he added, but it is only one of several factors. Bats also need to pass the disease on to humans. There is no evidence of this being done directly for coronaviruses. Until now there has been an intermediary – either a domesticated animal or a wild animal which humans came into contact with for food, trade, pets or medicine. In the Sars outbreak in China, it was a civet cat. In the Mers outbreak in the Middle East in it was a camel. Scientists are not yet certain of the animal for though Frutos said initial theories that a pangolin was the intermediary now seem less likely. In a soon-to-be-published paper in Frontiers in Medicine , Frutos and his co-authors argue the key to containing future epidemics is not to fear the wild, but to recognise that human activities are responsible for the emergence and propagation of the zoonosis. “The focus must be on these human activities because they can be properly organised,” notes the paper titled, the Conjunction of Events Leading to the Pandemic and Lessons to Learn for Future Threats. Scientists have detected about different strains of coronavirus in bats. Most are harmless to humans, but two very closely related sarbecoviruses found in east Asia were responsible for Sars and The paper says future sarbecovirus emergence will certainly take place in east Asia, but epidemics of other new diseases could be triggered elsewhere. South America is a key area of concern due to the rapid clearance of the Amazon and other forests. Scientists in Brazil have found viral prevalence was among bats near deforested sites, compared to in pristine woodland. “With deforestation and land-use change, you open a door,” said Alessandra Nava, of the Manaus-based Biobank research centre. She said diseases were naturally diluted in the wild, but this broke down when humans rapidly disrupted the ecological balance. As a local example, she pointed to Lyme disease, which has spread to humans through capybaras. Some municipalities are culling the giant rodents to prevent contagion, but Nava said this was not necessary in pristine forests that still had jaguars. “You don’t find Lyme disease in areas with jaguars because they keep the capybara numbers in check,” she said. “The problem is when you put different species that aren’t naturally close to one another in the same environment. That allows virus mutations to jump to other species,” she said. “We have to think about how we treat wild animals and nature. Right now we deal with them far too promiscuously.” Her conclusions were echoed by Tierra Smiley Evans, an epidemiologist at the University of California who studies virus distributions in the rapidly degrading forests of Myanmar. She has found that endangered or threatened species are more likely to have viruses than animals at lower risk of habitat loss and hunting. She said the connection between environmental stress and human health had been made more apparent by pandemic. “I’m hopeful that one of the most positive things to come out of horrible tragedy will be the realisation that there is a link between how we treat the forest and our wellbeing,” she said. “It really impacts our health. It is not just a wildlife issue or an environmental issue.” Brazil: largest rise in deaths follows Bolsonaro 'worst is over' claim To prevent future pandemics, the academics said international cooperation was needed to encourage monitoring and education at a local level so that virus outbreaks could be detected and contained at an early stage. Although this would be expensive, they said it would more economically efficient than waiting for an outbreak to become a pandemic, which forces the world into lockdown. They also emphasised that bat culls and bans on wet markets were likely to be ineffective and could prove counterproductive because bats play an important role in insect control and plant pollination. “Living safely with bats is what we should be focusing on, not eliminating them,” Evans said. Conservation groups have also urged greater protection of existing habitats. A recent Greenpeace report warned the Amazon could see the next spillover of zoonotic viruses because the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, is putting a higher priority on opening up the forest than protecting people health. “It unforgivable. His appetite for destruction is fuelling the current health crisis and will make future crises we face even worse,” Daniela Montalto, Greenpeace forests campaigner, said. “He must be stopped and forest protection prioritised. Without it, we will all pay the price.”",1116
13,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/07/world-cannot-return-to-business-as-usual-after-covid-19-say-mayors,"Mayors from many of the world leading cities have warned there can be no return to “business as usual” in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis if humanity is to escape catastrophic climate breakdown. City leaders representing more than million people have published a “statement of principles”, which commits them to putting greater equality and climate resilience at the heart of their recovery plans. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City and one of the signatories to the statement, said: “Half-measures that maintain the status quo won’t move the needle or protect us from the next crisis. “We need a new deal for these times – a massive transformation that rebuilds lives, promotes equality and prevents the next economic, health or climate crisis.” Many cities have already announced measures to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. In London, Sadiq Khan announced plans on Wednesday to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians across the capital in an effort to encourage “green and sustainable travel” and prevent a spike in car use and pollution after the lockdown. The move came as Transport for London modelling revealed there could be a increase in cycling, and up to five times the amount of walking, compared with pre-coronavirus levels, if people returned to work but avoided public transport. Khan, who is vice-chair of the group, said he was determined to “build a better future” in the aftermath of the pandemic. has exposed the inequality in our society and deep flaws in our economy, which fail people from deprived communities more than anyone else,” he said. “We need to come out of this embracing a new normal and with a renewed drive to address the climate emergency.” In Greater Manchester, council leaders have unveiled plans to give more space for people walking and cycling across the region. With of funding from the mayor, local authorities are planning a range of measures from extending pavements to creating one-way streets, removing through-traffic from residential neighbourhoods and building extra cycle lanes. Last week, mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks as part of a newly formed economic task force . They agreed to coordinate efforts to map out plans to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis. Mark Watts, the chief executive of said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. “There is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential,” he said. “We are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into, which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings … cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns.” The statement of principles has so far been signed by mayors representing world cities from Los Angeles to Lisbon, São Paulo to Seoul, Melbourne to Mexico City. The statement warns that the recovery from “should not be a return to ‘business as usual’ – because that is a world on track for or more of overheating.” It also states that immediate action on the climate will “accelerate economic recovery and enhance social equity, through the use of new technologies and the creation of new industries and new jobs”. Mike Bloomberg, the board president and a former mayor of New York City, said: “This taskforce is committed to helping city leaders as they work on economic recovery in ways that lead us forward into the future, not back into the past. The principles we’ve outlined will guide our efforts to develop a new normal – one that is greener, healthier, and more prosperous for everyone.”",652

And we know that Guardian readers are equally passionate about the need for governments, businesses and individuals to take immediate action to avoid a catastrophe for humanity and for the natural world. Today the Guardian is making a pledge to our readers that we will play our part, both in our journalism and in our own organisation, to address the climate emergency. We hope this underlines to you the Guardian deep commitment to quality environmental journalism, rooted in scientific fact. We have always led the way in environmental reporting, whether it covering air pollution or wildlife extinction, threats to the oceans or the human and social costs that rising temperatures bring. 'It a crisis, not a change': the six Guardian language changes on climate matters But now more than ever, we believe the Guardian specialist team of reporters, editors and writers has a vital role to play in working with our readers to understand the unfolding climate crisis and all its ramifications. We now have dedicated reporters around the world, including in the US, the biggest carbon polluter on the globe; Australia, the biggest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas; and Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro has disputed that climate is a factor as fires rage in the Amazon. As an organisation we will take steps to address the Guardian own impact on the environment. Today we commit to achieving net zero emissions by and we are currently undertaking a full audit of our emissions to assess how we will achieve this challenging goal. Through our recently acquired B Corp status, which commits us to reducing our environmental impact as well as to high standards of governance and social impact, we will be transparent and accountable. At the Guardian we believe it is vital to give people open access to factual, independent reporting on the climate crisis. For this reason, and thanks to generous financial support from readers in more than countries, we can keep all Guardian journalism free of a paywall. Thank you. This support allows us to focus on delivering powerful reporting on the climate emergency, and its impact on people and the planet. Just last week we published a global investigative series, The Polluters , examining how just companies are responsible for more than a third of all global emissions. This reporting, by our environmental team and network of correspondents around the world with their wealth of specialist knowledge, is possible only with the support of Guardian readers. In her speech to Congress in September, Greta Thunberg said: “This is the moment in history when we need to be wide awake.” I agree. And my pledge today is that the Guardian will give the climate crisis the attention it demands – and deliver our open independent reporting to everyone.

15,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/16/guardian-language-changes-climate-environment,"In addition to providing updated guidelines on which images our editors should use to illustrate the climate emergency, we have updated our style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. Our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said: “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue”. These are the guidelines provided to our journalists and editors to be used in the production of all environment coverage across the Guardian website and paper: The urgency of climate crisis needed robust new language to describe it | Paul Chadwick “climate emergency” or “climate crisis” to be used instead of “climate change” Climate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the overall situation; use climate emergency or climate crisis instead to describe the broader impact of climate change. However, use climate breakdown or climate change or global heating when describing it specifically in a scientific or geophysical sense eg “Scientists say climate breakdown has led to an increase in the intensity of hurricanes”. “climate science denier” or “climate denier” to be used instead of “climate sceptic” The OED defines a sceptic as “a seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions”. Most “climate sceptics”, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, deny climate change is happening, or is caused by human activity, so ‘denier’ is more accurate. Use “global heating” not “global warming” ‘Global heating’ is more scientifically accurate. Greenhouse gases form an atmospheric blanket that stops the sun heat escaping back to space. “greenhouse gas emissions” is preferred to “carbon emissions” or “carbon dioxide emissions”. Although carbon emissions is not inaccurate, if we’re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere, this term recognises all of the climate-damaging gases, including methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs etc. Use “wildlife”, not “biodiversity” We felt that ‘wildlife’ is a much more accessible word and is fair to use in many stories, and is a bit less clinical when talking about all the creatures with whom we share the planet. Use “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” This change emphasises that fish do not exist solely to be harvested by humans – they play a vital role in the natural health of the oceans. Today we pledge to give the climate crisis the attention it demands | Katharine Viner Since we announced these changes, they have been reported widely , shared across social media channels, and even prompted some other media outlets to reconsider the term s they use in their own coverage. The update to the Guardian style guide, originally announced earlier this year, followed the addition of the global carbon dioxide level to the Guardian daily weather pages – the simplest measure of how the mass burning of fossil fuels is disrupting the stable climate. To put it simply, while weather changes daily, climate changes over years and decades. So alongside the daily carbon count, we publish the level in previous years for comparison, as well as the pre-industrial-era baseline of and the level seen as manageable in the long term of In order to keep below of warming, the aspiration of the world nations, we need to halve emissions by and reach zero by mid century. It is also likely we will need to remove from the atmosphere, perhaps by the large-scale restoration of nature . It is a huge task, but we hope that tracking the daily rise of will help to maintain focus on it.

16,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/18/guardian-climate-pledge-2019-images-pictures-guidelines,"At the Guardian we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world. The Guardian climate pledge Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the Guardian. We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative. The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals , who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”. It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen. We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent. So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the individual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these: In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images: But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging , between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks. Today we pledge to give the climate crisis the attention it demands | Katharine Viner In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe . In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures. The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement. It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, biodiversity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods. As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice. However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.

17,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/guardian-editors-climate-emergency-pledge,"Jamie Wilson, foreign news editor, and Simon Jeffery, deputy foreign editor The climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe. For many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is. In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over C were recorded in France for the first time , a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes , and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space. Such events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify. In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold . Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and individuals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil president, Jair Bolsonaro , where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation. There are also those attempting to make it better. On September we published an interview from Stockholm with a who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg solo protest has since become a global movement. Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani . Julia Finch, business editor Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement target of limiting global warming to From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment. These are huge questions, and Guardian readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like. Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come. We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short. Writing in the Guardian earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said. Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state history – cost insurers more than . Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed. Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress. We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year , and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer . Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK. Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next years. Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal &amp; General, Europe second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year : “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.” However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world biggest investment manager, with under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock job is to make a profit for investors . He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.” They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting. Jess Cartner-Morley, associate editor (Fashion) Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the most important issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage. We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. We will continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readers paramount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background. We have always championed ethical fashion brands , but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet. What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintage pieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe , and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it. None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too. Tim Lusher, editor of Feast There an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have. Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them. As well as covering the environmental impact of food production, we’re thinking about what we publish in lifestyle terms. The Guardian archive contains nearly recipes, of which use meat of some kind, but that figure is down to for articles created in and We aim to run recipes that use only sustainable fish (we follow the Marine Conservation Society Good Fish Guide in the UK and associates in the US and Australia ). Food is complicated though and it not all about meat. Almonds and avocados use a huge amount of water. Generally, it feels an era to be mindful – we have a zero waste column and readers love its inventive, resourceful, frugal ideas. It important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, divided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It also a time when it difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the Guardian.",1769
18,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/climate-science-deniers-environment-warning,"The shouted words rang out across the packed parliamentary corridor: “Fiona Harvey is the worst journalist there is. She the worst journalist of them all, because she should know better.” They were the words of Lord Lawson, former UK chancellor of the exchequer, turned climate denier and now Brexiter , addressing a crowd of more than people trying to cram into a House of Commons hearing on climate change. As listeners craned their necks to hear better, whispering and nudging, he elaborated at length on my insistence on reporting the work of the of the world climate scientists whose work shows human responsibility for global heating, and failure to give equal weight to the tiny number of dissenters. As the science of climate chaos has become vastly clearer in the past two decades, and the warnings more stark, the rearguard action fought by climate denialists has grown fiercer and their attacks more vicious. Fact-based arguments will never serve their purpose; trolling is the last refuge of the discredited. We can expect much more of the same. When I began writing full-time on the environment in climate change had hit a political impasse. George W Bush was in the White House, the US preoccupied with the war on terror and – as Bush admitted – “addicted to oil” . The Kyoto protocol was on ice, without the backing of enough countries to bring it into force, and international negotiations on greenhouse gases were stagnating as a result. Suddenly, like a glacier destabilising, small cracks turned into crevasses and whole edifices came avalanching down. First Russia played the unlikely hero: by ratifying Kyoto in late (cynically, in return for a favour at the World Trade Organization) the Duma rescued the treaty from the scrapheap of history. That was enough to galvanise the UN negotiations, loosening entrenched positions and giving the talks a point once more. Tony Blair did his bit by making climate change the main theme for the UK presidency of the , which forced world leaders to confront the issue. The EU emissions trading scheme came into being early that year, marking the first time companies were held responsible financially for their carbon output. Soon after that Nicholas Stern, former World Bank chief economist, published his landmark review of the economics of climate change , showing definitively that tackling global heating was cheap, at a few per cent of GDP at most, and certainly much cheaper than the consequences. Climate change has sometimes been dismissed by journalists as a “slow burn” issue: day after day, the ice melts a fraction, the sea laps closer to shore, the carbon count ticks slowly upward and the story remains much the same. But the last decade and a half have seen dramatic change, not just at the melting ice caps. Activism used to mean a few brave (or “foolhardy”, if you opposed them) individuals climbing a power station chimney or pausing a Land Rover production line . Few people imagined years ago that climate protest would become by now a mass movement, with thousands of people prepared to be arrested and schoolchildren around the planet shaming their elders by going on strike. The likes of veganism and the no-fly movement were easily dismissed as fringe fanaticism, never to catch on. Few people would have dared forecast in when Kyoto appeared dead, that in a new global treaty would bind all countries to prevent heating crossing the crucial threshold. I stood in the packed hall that evening with hundreds of others holding our breath as the gavel finally come down on stage and suddenly delegates from nearly countries were leaping to their feet, whooping and cheering and weeping. Since then, some governments have followed this up with laws to enforce net zero carbon emissions by mid-century. None of this is enough, of course. Audible in the background is the drumbeat of new science, data piling on data showing how close we are coming to disaster. In I watched the scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emerge bleary-eyed from an all-night session in Paris where they faced down vested interests to warn emissions must peak by the early to avoid dangerous climate change. By in the fifth report in Stockholm, they predicted it would be years before the threshold would be breached. Last year, in the starkest warning yet , the IPCC gave us years to reverse direction. And there have been serious setbacks, some predictable (financiers clinging to their business models, vested interests blocking progress) but others less so. Few people years ago noticed the new fracking technology beginning to be applied to dense shale rocks, bringing vast new fossil fuel sources on stream and turning the US into a net oil exporter. Fewer still foresaw a Donald Trump presidency. Stealthily, too, came the rise of the national oil companies as they wrested control of reserves from the likes of ExxonMobil, Chevron and Total. Giants like BP and Shell may be painted as villains but at least they are accountable to their shareholders, and must obey stock exchange rules. National oil companies answer only to their governments, and many of those governments pay only lip service to transparency. Our climate knowledge has increased vastly in years. No one can now plausibly say there is not enough data, or that we lack the technology, or that saving the climate is too expensive. All of these pretexts have been exploded by patient scientific work. There are no excuses left and now it is up to journalists to ensure there are no more hiding places either, in the boardrooms, on the websites of fake news, behind the facade of populism. That is what the Guardian has committed to do, with a clear focus on the climate emergency. Even if that upsets some people in the corridors of power: there can be pride in being the worst, if that what it means.",986
19,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2020/may/11/this-could-be-the-time-to-usher-in-a-golden-age-for-cycling-in-britain,"aturday announcement of extra funds for walking and cycling was a rare example of political focus on sustainable travel. Could the investment announced by the transport minister, Grant Shapps , help usher in what Boris Johnson pledged a week earlier: a ‘golden age for cycling’ ?. The measures announced at the weekend reflect the place cycling and walking have taken in our lives during the coronavirus crisis – and the key role they will play in our medium- and long-term future. Quieter roads, combined with enforced time at home, have boosted cycling and walking by up to in some places, the government says. More space for those activities matters because for the foreseeable future, public transport will be reduced to just of its capacity and if the remaining trips move to private cars, we’re in for gridlock and air pollution. This is especially bad news with a respiratory virus running amok – several studies have suggested air pollution can worsen the impacts of the virus . With almost half of commutes less than three miles, cycling and walking can take up a considerable amount of slack. What more, many people do not want to go back to their previous car-choked lives. So, what was announced? There was for cycling and walking, with fast-tracked for pop-up bike lanes. It important to note this money was already announced in February as part of a buses and cycling fund , and it spread over five years, ie a year. The really good news for active travel is the new statutory guidance that, where public transport use is high, local authorities should reallocate road space for walking and cycling. This is the first time a UK transport secretary has said that. Measures can include pop-up cycle routes, including turning traffic lanes over to cycling using flexible wands, and widening pedestrian space with cones. Authorities can also restrict through-traffic near schools, residential streets and high streets, which can be done cheaply with planters and bollards. Bus- and bike-only corridors are another option, along with new zones, while councils with existing local cycling and walking infrastructure plans are encouraged to bring those forward. What more, GPs can prescribe cycling and exercise. In June there will be an updated Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy, with an active travel commissioner already being mooted , and a new inspectorate that could potentially ensure councils meet new higher standards for permanent infrastructure across England. Phil Jones, an urban designer and transport planning consultant, sees the inspectorate as significant, and says councils not including walking and cycling in their plans will need to give reasons for the decisions, or risk finding themselves in breach. It particularly helpful for councils wanting to create cycling and walking space but nervous of doing so, and this guidance will help residents push for such measures. It will also be harder for local authorities with high public transport use, such as in cities, not to act. Temporary infrastructure is cheap, and once there it easier for people to understand the benefits, and want to keep it. Cycling and walking will have a long-term budget, similar to roads – something which is long overdue. A big caveat is that the announced over five years keeps cycle funding flat. With that sum, the government is only forecast to get a third of the way to its target of doubling the percentage of cycle trips people take – from of all journeys in to by According to the Walking and Cycling Alliance, a network of active travel bodies, is needed over the next five years to achieve the target. By contrast, the latest road building bonanza resulted in being allocated for miles of roads. Vouchers for cycle repairs are welcome to help bring old bikes out of sheds into safe use, but electric bike subsidies – similar to those for electric cars – would have been good. As ebikes extend the distances people can cycle, with more widespread use one in five people in the UK could cycle to work. In Manchester last week, the city cycling and walking commissioner, Chris Boardman, asked the government to permit zebra crossings across side roads without Belisha beacons – something common across Europe but currently illegal in the UK. That hasn’t happened yet, but would represent an extremely progressive move. Cycling UK would like to see public health at the heart of transport and they say this is a potential step towards that – and arguably towards cycling being treated as a legitimate form of transport. It is understood that this active travel push comes from Johnson himself. As someone who cycles, the prime minister understands its benefits. As London mayor he and his cycling commissioner, Andrew Gilligan – now his cycling adviser at No – achieved dramatic improvements in infrastructure. If the nation is to see the improvements Johnson hopes for, the next couple of months will be crucial. Councils must step up and help implement the infrastructure that will benefit everyone, regardless of their chosen modes of transport. It far from a done deal, but the pieces are in place and with courage, the UK now has an opportunity to bring in the “golden age of cycling” the prime minister has promised.",872
20,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/12/its-like-nothing-else-insect-swarms-on-cyprus-reveal-incredible-journeys-aoe,"or eight hours a day, from March until May, research biologist Will Hawkes surveys huge swarms of insects landing on the Karpaz Peninsula on the north-east corner of Cyprus. “This place is a migratory hotspot for millions of painted lady butterflies, drone fly hoverflies, seven-spot ladybirds and vagrant emperor dragonflies – it like nothing I’ve ever seen before,” says Hawkes, a PhD student at the University of Exeter Genetics of Migration lab who first studied the phenomenon here a year ago. “This island is a pit stop for millions of insects that fly at high altitudes over the sea then come to land to rest as they migrate, possibly thousands of kilometres from the Middle East to western Europe. It just astonishing that these creatures migrate such long distances and in such vast numbers in order to find the right food to eat and to reproduce in environments at particular temperatures,” he says. “One grass fly we found at Cyprus is just long, so, for their body size, these migrations are quite incredible. Most of the time they’re completely invisible to us,” adds Hawkes, who explains that the distances travelled by insects flying via Cyprus are as yet unknown. The furthest insect migration recorded is the journey of the globe skimmer dragonfly between India and Africa. Hawkes PhD supervisor, Dr Karl Wotton, describes his research at Karpaz as significant. “Migration hotspots like this are a window into processes that normally go on unseen, high above our heads, as huge amounts of insects make seasonal movements,” says Wotton. “This Cyprus hotspot shows how distant ecosystems can nevertheless be connected. It part of an emerging global picture of insects on the move.” Hawkes collects insects flying along a gully using a butterfly net in a “Victorian-style study”, then puts them into an insect cage to identify the species before releasing them. He also sets up tiny cameras to record insects flying past for timed periods at set intervals – back in the UK, he spends weeks manually counting the numbers in every shot, frame by frame. “We can record thousands of insects flying past per minute – it a big challenge,” says Hawkes who, by returning annually, is building a long-term data set to let scientists observe trends and patterns over time. “Some butterfly, dragonfly and hoverfly migrations have previously been studied but very few studies look at the bigger picture of insect migration. There are huge gaps in our knowledge; we’re genuinely at the very beginning of understanding these insect migrations.” Radar studies show that trillion insects tons of biomass) migrate annually above southern Britain alone, as published in the journal Science. “Many of these insects are key pollinators and play a major role in pest control, so they’re absolutely vital to agriculture simply due to their sheer numbers,” says Hawkes. “Flies are the most numerous migrants and they have such an enormous impact on the biodiversity of our ecosystems and pollination of crops and plants.” In July Wotton, a senior lecturer at Exeter, revealed in the journal Current Biolog y that billion hoverflies migrate into and out of southern Britain each year. As larvae, these hoverflies consume trillion aphids, a species that would otherwise be damaging to crops. As adults, hoverflies eat nectar and pollen and are second only to bees in terms of their importance as pollinators. Wotton recorded that migrant hoverflies each carry on average grains of pollen, flying up to miles a day. By transferring pollen between different populations of plants as they travel, migratory insects help maintain a diverse gene pool for wild plants and crops, increasing resilience to changes in environmental conditions and the effects of climate change. Remarkably, insects are multigenerational migrants – one full circuit involves between three and six generations of adults moving north from springtime to late summer, followed by one generation travelling back south during the autumn migration. The adults die once eggs are laid, before larvae hatch, so these long-distance migrations are not learned behaviours. “These migrations are purely genetic. Insects use the sun as their compass and only migrate on days when the winds are favourable ,” says Hawkes, who also surveys insects flying along the valleys in the Pyrenees mountains on their autumn migration south. “It also likely that when a huge volume of adults dies at the end of each leg of the journey, their biomass provides a seasonal input of nutrients in each location which could be a key food source for other species.” But with plummeting insect populations, conserving biodiversity has never been more crucial. A global review published in the journal Biological Conservation found that more than of insect species are declining and a third are endangered. “Migratory insects are vulnerable to habitat loss beyond the boundaries of one country, and climate breakdown could affect the migration routes and ranges of these insect species so we need to take a more global, holistic view of conservation,” says Hawkes, who believes farmers can make an enormous difference by reducing the use of pesticides and leaving field margins to grow wild. “It easy to see the difference in numbers of insect types between a patch of wildflowers at the edge of a field and the middle of a crop – we need to move away from monoculture towards agro-ecology.” Matt Shardlow, chief executive of invertebrate conservation charity Buglife, warns that spray drift and soil transport of pesticides into field margins pose a risk and that wildflower-rich habitats should be prioritised in urban areas, on road verges and railways, away from crops sprayed with pesticides. “We’re restoring wildflower grassland to increase the availability of pollen and nectar for dispersing wild insects along a network of insect pathways called B-Lines throughout the British countryside and towns,” says Shardlow, who is keen to persuade the authorities and EU partners to roll the network out across Europe. “These B-Lines will enable better dispersal of migrants and enable more species to start dispersing north again – something that prevented by increasingly fragmented habitats and the polluted nature of intervening land.” On an international scale, further research is required before the science of this Cyprus migration hotspot can influence policy and conservation management. “We need further understanding of the biology of the species involved, natural variation in numbers and the routes taken before any strong recommendations can be made,” Wotton says. “Conservation of entire migratory tracks takes collaboration between farmers, conservationists and politicians,” Hawkes adds. “We need to think beyond borders and consider how habitats link together along these migratory routes. “At an international level, we need politicians to realise that insects are playing a vital role so that governments create consistent policies that protect the diversity of insects and the plants they rely on.” Find more age of extinction coverage here , and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",1150

An adult female slides down a tree, a flash of black fur and elongated limb. More follow, with infants and juveniles in tow. A grunting silverback descends to join its family, the branches buckling beneath approximately of iconic primate. Then Nizeyimana, a specialist vet offering hands-on care in the wild, spots a remarkable scene. Ambling up the steep, wooded slope, another gorilla family has emerged from the valley floor. The first group look on, then head deeper into the primeval jungle of Uganda Bwindi Impenetrable national park – one of Africa most ancient habitats and home to almost half of the world mountain gorillas. Such a close and well-populated encounter with one of humankind nearest relatives (witnessed before the pandemic) would have been inconceivable during the dark days of the early when it was estimated that there were only mountain gorillas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Virunga national park, and around thought to be in Bwindi. That all-time low prompted fears they would vanish by the end of the century. Even in early the conservation status of these gorillas put them one step away from extinction. Now, thanks to a far-reaching initiative, a recent census has revealed the number of known mountain gorillas has increased to – taking them off the red list of critically endangered species. Amid climate chaos and unbridled habitat destruction, this is a momentous achievement, albeit one that could now be reversed by the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus poses lethal threat to great apes, experts warn Experts who led the revival put their success down to engaging local communities, securing government support and promoting transnational collaboration, a three-pronged strategy that could offer beleaguered areas worldwide a roadmap to recovery. Not any one country could have, on its own, been responsible for the recovery Anna Behm Masozera, IGCP “When done well, this can be a phenomenal success,” says Dr Timothy Tear, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society Africa programme, which has been involved in the decades-long campaign to save the mountain gorilla. “We need to be recognising there are many more opportunities to do things like this in other countries.” Environmentalists stress the importance of giving local communities a stake in the survival of the local area, ensuring they profit from ecotourism and other money-making activities that provide alternatives to hunting and resource exploitation. These income streams can fuel a country economic vitality, winning state support by helping to assert the animals’ worth to policymakers in capitals far from wilderness areas. “The revenue that mountain gorillas produce is a major reason why governments are valuing this resource,” says Tear. Permits to visit gorillas for one hour start at per person in Uganda, rising to in Rwanda. These sums are eye-watering, but crucial. Worldwide, up to a year is needed to conserve healthy ecosystems, a Credit Suisse report estimates, a long way from the actually raised. Mountain gorilla habitats span Rwanda, Uganda and the war-wracked DRC, so partnerships unconstrained by political frontiers are essential. Such “conservation diplomacy” played out in when the three countries signed a treaty committing to coordinate the conservation of the region. “Not any one country could have, on its own, been responsible for the recovery,” says Anna Behm Masozera, director of the IGCP, a regional coalition of environmental groups. If this continues, it definitely going to reverse the achievements. There no doubt about it Bashir Hangi, Uganda Wildlife Authority But serious threats remain, from irresponsible development to climate change – and now Our simian ancestors share about of human DNA and can catch respiratory diseases from people, with deadly consequences. Leading scientists warned last month that poses an “existential threat” to primates and that, for mountain gorillas in particular, the introduction of a new, highly-infectious disease could be a “potential extinction-level event”. In response, rangers in Bwindi are now required to wear face masks, use hand sanitiser and keep their distance from the apes. The suspension of ecotourism during the coronavirus pandemic has also meant the main source of revenue for gorilla conservation has been lost and there are fears some of those in surrounding communities who depend on tourists could turn to poaching out of desperation. “We are worried,” says Bashir Hangi, a spokesman for the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the state body that manages Bwindi and nine other national parks. “If this continues, it definitely going to reverse the achievements. There no doubt about it.” Back from the brink Ever since a young military officer named Oscar von Beringe discovered mountain gorillas (then promptly shot two of them) in these magnificent mammals have endured persecution. Disease, hunting and habitat destruction have blighted their two populations, split between Bwindi in Uganda and the Virunga range of extinct volcanoes that straddle DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. It was in that conservation groups first started collaborating to protect the dwindling population, founding the Mountain Gorilla Project to run tourism and education initiatives to change local attitudes. But gorilla numbers continued to drop, whether they were dying in traps intended for antelope, or being killed in retaliation for raiding crops. Grisly trinkets made from their hands and heads were sold in tourist markets. The legendary primatologist Dian Fossey began using uncompromising methods to pull these critically-endangered creatures back from the brink, from repelling herders by spray-painting cattle to directly confronting poachers, many of whom were impoverished locals with few options. In a few weeks before her birthday, Fossey was murdered in Rwanda. Her killers were never found. Shortly before her murder, Fossey had said she feared there would be no mountain gorillas left within years. But a census one year after her death revealed the opposite; numbers were increasing. “There was a glimmer of success,” says Behm Masozera, the IGCP director. “In order to sustain that success, a more cohesive programme was built around it.” This resulted in the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) – a coalition of nonprofits comprising Conservation International, Fauna &amp; Flora International and WWF that was more formalised than the Mountain Gorilla Project, with a remit across DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. This long-term alliance, argues one member, should be replicated elsewhere. “This is entirely the way we need to be working,” says Cath Lawson, regional conservation manager for Africa at WWF-UK, “to have that transformational change for wildlife like mountain gorillas to thrive.” In despite DRC protracted conflict and the earlier horrors of the Rwandan genocide, sustained efforts had increased Virunga population to An additional in the cloud forests of Bwindi brought the total population to individuals. The upward trajectory continued, propelled by intergovernmental treaty. Snares, fashioned from ropes or wires that cut deep into gorilla flesh, began to disappear. In November the subspecies was upgraded from critically endangered to endangered, having surpassed individuals. By the end of the number of known mountain gorillas reached But there is no room for complacency. “Yes, this demonstrates what we can achieve,” says Lawson. “But it not a done deal.” Ecotourism has played a central role in this conservation triumph, alongside a scheme that splits the revenue with nearby communities, adapting earlier divisive models of “fortress conservation” into something more inclusive and equitable. Undeniably, though, coercive methods to protect wildlife have devastated traditional life for Batwa “pygmies”, a forest-dependent indigenous minority who were evicted in their thousands from Bwindi and other Ugandan parks as protection activities ramped up in the early and continue to suffer today. Yet other local communities hail the Bwindi project – and its pragmatic fusion of wealth creation with environmentalism – as a genuine gain. The Change A Life Bwindi charity trains former poachers in beekeeping, mothers in basket weaving, and teenage girls unable to afford school in tailoring. These income-generating activities emphasise the advantages of living near a thriving gorilla population to which cash-rich westerners are drawn daily. “We see Bwindi as a good thing,” says Hilda Ariho, a community leader. “It brings tourists here and without it we’d be poorer. It helping a lot of women.” Back inside the park, after Nizeyimana spots the two gorilla families, a group of tourists have one hour to absorb the scene, whether by taking a slew of selfies or observing in quiet contemplation. The tourists depart and the silverback reclines, watching over his relatives in a mountainous landscape that for approximately years has woven itself into an awe-inspiring tangle of vines, trunks and creepers across the Albertine Rift valley. Conservationists are hoping that these mountain gorillas continue to thrive and that the latest threat, can be beaten.

22,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/conservation-in-crisis-covid-19-coronavirus-ecotourism-collapse-threatens-communities-and-wildlife-aoe,"From the vast plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya to the delicate corals of the Aldabra atoll in the Seychelles, conservation work to protect some of the world most important ecosystems is facing crisis following a collapse in ecotourism during the pandemic. Organisations that depend on visitors to fund projects for critically endangered species and rare habitats could be forced to close, according to wildlife NGOs, after border closures and worldwide travel restrictions abruptly halted millions of pounds of income from tourism. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have repeatedly urged humanity to reset its relationship with nature or suffer worse outbreaks. But the economic consequences of the lockdown have raised fears of a surge in poaching, illegal fishing and deforestation in life-sustaining ecosystems, with tens of thousands of jobs in the ecotourism sector at risk around the world. “It right that the global focus now is on protecting human lives in this devastating pandemic. However, in the places we work, we are already witnessing its economic impact, particularly in areas where communities rely heavily on ecotourism for their livelihoods,” said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF UK. 'We did it to ourselves': scientist says intrusion into nature led to pandemic In Cambodia, three critically endangered giant ibis were killed for meat in early April following the collapse of the local tourism industry, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. In central Africa, measures to shield mountain gorillas from the virus have resulted in a slump in vital visitor revenue. Twelve rangers who guarded Virunga national park, where the gorillas live, w ere killed in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo last month. “It could be years before these places can fully recover, increasing the risk that people come to rely on other activities to make a living, putting unsustainable pressure on natural resources,” Bartlett said. “Additionally it is currently much harder to monitor land grabbing and illegal poaching.” While the poaching of rhinos, big cats and critically endangered species has continued during lockdown, a recent Wildlife Justice Commission report found the illegal wildlife trade had been severely disrupted by movement and travel restrictions. But conservationists fear an explosion of illegal hunting if organisations are forced to lay off wildlife rangers and suspend surveillance programmes. Black rhinos in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, have been evacuated after at least six were killed by poachers in March. Dickson Kaelo, chief executive officer at Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, said all bookings for this year key activities such as the wildebeest migration in the Masai Mara had been cancelled, prompting difficult choices about staff in Kenya conservancies. “While elephant poaching may not escalate owing to the current suppression of international travel and negative sentiments against animal products in south-east Asia, demand for bushmeat will go up if there is nobody to monitor activities within the conservancies,” he said. “Poaching for bushmeat already existed on a small scale even before the coronavirus outbreak. With more Kenyans out of work, bushmeat will be more appealing than meat sold by the licensed butcher. If the rangers have no salaries, how will they effectively monitor human activities in and out of the conservancies?” Wildlife conservation in Kenya had already suffered a series of setbacks following a devastating locust invasion and a viral outbreak among livestock in the the Greater Mara conservation area. Kaelo said coronavirus will compound the effects on community-led wildlife conservation. “Members of these communities may lose faith in wildlife conservation if there is no money forthcoming. In addition, people who live around these wildlife havens and looked forward to selling artefacts to tourists may resort to other income-generating activities such as farming, fuelling the never-ending human-wildlife conflicts as animals invade and destroy their new farms,” he said. In Colombia, the big cat conservation organisation Panthera has recorded a spike in big cat poaching, with two jaguars, an ocelot and a puma killed in recent weeks. The organisation has experienced delays in funding during the pandemic. While rangers are forced to stay at home, Dr Esteban Payán, director of the jaguar programme in the region, said he was concerned about illegal land grabbing and intentional wildfires. “My worst fear post-pandemic is that once we go out, we’re going to find hectares and hectares of fenced-out new farmland where you don’t know who they are or what is happening. There rampant deforestation in Colombia right now in the Amazon. “That worries me more than increased poaching. Why? Because of the scale, size and speed of deforestation and fires. That just destroys the habitat. And with the habitat, there go the jaguars. You might not see a bloody animal on the ground with a bullet in it but it worse because they’re either homeless and burned, burned alive or they don’t have any prey.” Global Fishing Watch has recorded a substantial drop in fishing around the world, with fishing hours down nearly from March to the end of April compared with the past two years. But the drop in ecotourism has affected conservation of the world most precious marine ecosystems. Dr Fanny Douvere, Unesco marine programme coordinator for world heritage sites, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Galápagos Islands and the West Norwegian Fjords, warned of the consequences of the downturn. “We need to be particularly worried about those sites that are heavily dependent on tourism revenues to finance some of their operations. In the Seychelles, for example, Aldabra atoll is not sure how it going to continue with its monitoring because it entirely financed by revenues from tourism,” she said. “As soon as tourism revenues fall apart, a lot of sites cannot continue their conservation, or at least part of it.” This piece was edited on May to correct an erroneous figure given for the drop in fishing hours Find more age of extinction coverage here , and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",990
23,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/11/chaotic-and-crazy-meat-plants-around-the-world-struggle-with-virus-outbreaks,"Outbreaks of at slaughterhouses are occurring in a number of countries around the world, in a development that may have long-term implications for food supply systems, say experts. The US has been hardest hit, with outbreaks at more than meat and processed food plants. But other countries with highly consolidated meat supply chains – Ireland, Spain, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Canada and the UK – are also struggling. “Workers are having to go back to work, and farmers are having to euthanise their animals,” said Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. “It a very chaotic, crazy situation.” The reasons for the outbreaks are said to be a combination of crowded working conditions, workforces that are often made up predominantly of migrant workers living in communal housing, and the fact that plants have remained open during the crisis. The problem is particularly acute where large companies dominate the industry, as has increasingly been the case. Many small slaughterhouses have been shut down over recent years in favour of fewer but larger plants that may have thousands of workers, leading to what one observer called “the most narrow bottleneck in US agribusiness”. In the short term, the issue is causing instability in the supply chain, with panic buying of meat in the US and the euthanisation of millions of farm animals . Questions are being asked about the risks to workers of infection and even death. In the long term, the problems will raise questions about stability and lack of resilience in the current system, which is dominated by a handful of vast international companies including Cargill, JBS, Smithfield and Tyson. outbreaks at Irish meat plants raise fears over worker safety In the US there have been almost cases and at least deaths among meat plant workers as of the end of April . The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting says there have now been more than cases linked to meat plants. Difficulties with physical distancing and hygiene, and crowded living and transportation conditions, are listed as potential risk factors by US health officials . More than meat plants have been closed in recent weeks , and one outbreak alone – at the Smithfield pork plant in South Dakota – saw more than confirmed cases. Workers may have continued to work while feeling ill due to economic insecurity, health officials said . Tyson poultry workers were being offered a bonus to continue working. In Germany there have been more than confirmed cases at the Müller Fleisch plant in Birkenfeld. The owners called it the “ most serious crisis ” in the plant history. The communal living spaces for the largely migrant workforce have been partially blamed. In Canada, cases have been confirmed at an Alberta meat packing house owned by Cargill, in the largest outbreak linked to a single facility in the country. In Australia, approximately cases have so far been confirmed at Cedar Meats in Melbourne , which has been shut down for deep cleaning. Prosecutors in Brazil are currently trying to close down plants – including some run by JBS and BRF – where cases have been detected. Cases have been confirmed at nine plants, according to a government report seen by Reuters , which stated that more than people may have been exposed. In Spain, there has been a row at Litera Meat in Binéfar, Aragon, about the number of workers who have the virus. Initial serological tests were positive for about workers. The management have carried out subsequent tests on workers to see if they are currently carrying the virus and had positive results. 'We're modern slaves': How meat plant workers became the new frontline in war Plants in Ireland have also been hit hard. Official figures show outbreaks at ten plants with more than workers affected . O utbreaks were reported at Liffey Meats in Cavan and Kepak plants in Roscommon and Longford. More than a third of the workforce – workers in all – at the Rosderra pigmeat plant in Co Tipperary reportedly tested positive for the virus, while last Friday Dawn Meats closed its plant in Westmeath following positive cases. “We are seeing the results of years of meat industry consolidation and vertical integration aimed at increasing profits through efficiency and low wages,” Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and global health at New York University told the Guardian, “regardless of effects on animals, workers, and the environment. reveals the costs to workers crowded together under already dangerous working conditions in jobs that often lacked sick leave and healthcare benefits. These are all problems dating from the early when the shareholder value movement forced corporations to have profit as their sole goal.” “I think it woken up a lot of people about how consolidated this system is, and how it is not very resilient, it really vulnerable,” said Lilliston. “People asking about food security in the US is kind of new. There is also a greater awareness of worker rights - the lack of power, working tightly packed together, the lack of government enforcement and inspection. I think there is going to be some fallout but whether action will be taken remains to be seen.” “It is clear that centralisation of processes into fewer and fewer centres, coupled with just-in-time supply chains, leads to a lack of resilience,” said Prof Tim Benton, research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank. “It not so easy to draft in a slaughterman off the street than to pull in casual labour into supermarkets or even farming.” The Guardian contacted all the companies named above. Cargill, JBS, Tyson and BRF detailed the significant work they are doing to deal with these issues including, in the case of JBS, working with physicians specialising in infectious diseases to develop a protocol, and, in the case of BRF, working with a global consultancy that specialises in risk management. Tyson has put aside to give its workers “thank you bonuses”. All four said that they are carrying out special measures in their plants to protect workers, including distancing, staggered breaks, keeping vulnerable workers home and distributing face masks. Cargill pointed out: “We are also sensitive that farmers and ranchers need a place to move their cattle. This is a difficult balancing act facing our entire industry … We recognise farmers and ranchers rely on the global food system to earn their livelihoods, so it is critical we keep the market moving – for the farm economy and for the people and animals who rely on us for their food and nourishment.” Litera Meats told the Guardian it is focused on keeping workers safe, and that “good sense, caution, collaboration and understanding” are the principles guiding the response. Liffey Meats said that the health and safety of workers was its priority.",1134
24,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/a-deadly-cycle-of-destruction-how-greed-for-land-is-fuelling-amazon-fires,"e found the first fire without looking, crackling and roaring on farmland beside the busy Amazon highway, the flames consuming a road sign with its name – – lying in the grass. Trucks thundered past, ferrying soya and corn from the agricultural heartlands of Brazil central-west to the ports of Santarém and Miritituba. Nobody was around. Every year fires roar across the Amazon, and in just a few months they will be here again. But last August the number of blazes reached a nine-year high, and sparked an international crisis for Brazil far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. Months later, their traces hung over the forests in the Amazon state of Pará, leaving blackened logs and charred tree stumps where there was once rainforest. But what happens to the land afterwards, especially in protected reserves? Is anyone punished for burning the forests? Are the forests allowed to grow back? Most of all, what can we expect from this year fire season? Late last year, reporters from the Guardian and investigative site Réporter Brasil spent a week at reserves along the to find out. We started in the hardscrabble settlers’ town of Novo Progresso in the state of Pará, with its plethora of gold shops serving the largely-illegal wildcat mining trade . Police are still investigating Novo Progresso farmers for allegedly coordinating a “fire day” last August to show Bolsonaro their will to work – fires soared by around the town that day. The town sits beside the Jamanxim national forest, a protected reserve of more than million hectares million acres) that is one of the most devastated in Brazil. Where better to begin? Rapacious history The first morning we steered the rented along a dirt road out of Novo Progresso, bouncing over potholes as it snaked in and out of the Jamanxim forest. This forest is managed by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), a federal environment agency named after the rubber tapper, activist and environmentalist who won international acclaim before being murdered in by cattle ranchers. Inside Jamanxim borders, as forest gave way to a sweep of cattle farms, we found more fire: a patch of forest still smouldering in places, trees swiped at waist height, and the felled, blackened trunk of a regal brazil nut tree in the scorched earth. An extensive search of government websites, publicly available information and internal ICMBio documents revealed that this very patch of forest has an emblematic history of environmental offences and fires. This smouldering land fell inside the hectares of land registered in by Jair Ferreira de Souza, a Novo Progresso resident, on Pará state government Rural Register (CAR), just inside the borders of the Jamanxim forest. In and Nasa satellites spotted fires on this land, and in and De Souza was fined more than for destroying hundreds of acres within it by environment officials who photographed cattle branded with his initials: JF. De Souza has appealed the fines, none of which have been paid. He told officials that he needed pasture and denied that one patch of destroyed forest was his. He claimed his family had owned land here for years, arguing that he had cleared only a minimal area he needed to work, and requested one fine be annulled because he was unable to pay it. Souza did not respond to messages sent to his phone. But to understand how Jair Ferreira de Souza is able to claim ownership of land within a federally protected forest, we need to step back into the Amazon chaotic and rapacious history of colonisation. The landgrabbers The military dictatorship that ruled Brazil until – often lauded by Bolsonaro - encouraged migration and built highways to force development into the Amazon region, but failed to impose a functioning property system. Instead, it sold off chunks of forest – then largely government owned – to private investors. It also handed out lots to migrants who had been encouraged to move there from the poorer north-east. Much of this land was sold on later, often in deals involving unscrupulous notaries in a range of scams that continue until today, aided by the remoteness and lawlessness of the Amazon region. Adding to the disorder, under Brazilian law, improving land you are on can strengthen an eventual ownership claim. And Amazon farmers often argue that previous governments had encouraged them to move to the region, only to plonk a reserve on top of them years later even if they actually squatted the land afterwards. “As long as it confusing, as long it undetermined who owns what, the guys with the lawyers, the guys with the guns and the influence always win,” said Jeremy Campbell, an associate professor of anthropology at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, who specialises in Amazon land conflicts. Landgrabbers – nicknamed grileiros , or crickets, after the tested ruse of leaving fake land titles in drawers full of the insects whose secretions turn them yellow and convincingly old-looking – proliferate in the Amazon. Having some sort of document is key to eventually legitimising stolen land. These days farmers register their own land online – as was done for de Souza – but often there is more than one claimant for the same area. In Pará, there are around three times as many land titles as there is land, state prosecutor Jane Souza said in an interview. In December, Bolsonaro signed a measure allowing grileiros to claim up to hectares acres) of land squatted before under certain conditions, such as no environmental fines or embargoes. This needs to be approved by Congress. The Jamanxim national forest reserve we were in was created in to slow rampant deforestation. Farms in the reserve were supposed to be repossessed by the government, but that never happened. Commercial agriculture is not permitted there but many local people have never accepted its reserve status. Paulo Moreira, a federal prosecutor in Pará, explained in an interview that protected areas like Jamanxim are attractive to speculators who buy illegally cleared land cheaply to sell on, or deforest it themselves, betting it will be regularised in the future and increase in value. “Crime compensates – and that makes it attractive,” Moreira said. We spoke to residents of Novo Progresso who clearly saw themselves as hard-working pioneers in a hostile wilderness. “Wood, gold prospecting and now cattle made this town,” Jadir Rosa told us. The mechanic had moved from Paraná state in the south of Brazil and was lunching in the town market. Rosa supported Bolsonaro and shared his government scepticism over climate science. “Global warming does not exist,” he said. Other residents similarly harboured little sympathy for environment officials. Laudi da Silva, a market stall holder and Bolsonaro supporter, complained that her brother wildcat mining barge had been destroyed during an operation by environment officials. “They’re always burning things round here,” she said. “I don’t like it.” Agamenon Menezes, the influential president of the town rural producers’ union, has been interviewed by police in connection with the “fire day” investigation, and his computer seized, but he denied involvement during an interview at his union headquarters. He argued that “fire day” had been invented by the media to attack Bolsonaro and that there were no more fires last August than in any other year. He denied man-made climate change existed because, he said, “serious” Brazilian scientists had disproved it. Menezes said Bolsonaro was popular in the region because he was against environmental officials and regulations preventing people working. “They have to eat, they have to produce food. So they work illegally,” he said. “Nobody wants to be illegal as well. They want to work legally.” Fires were lit to clear land for pasture that is then turned into agricultural land, he explained. “You get an area of dense forest and deforest it,” he said. “You need to burn this wood.” Environmentalists describe a similar deforestation process. First, landgrabbers and loggers remove the most valuable trees, leaving some cover to make it harder for satellites to spot the damage. The remaining trees are then felled, left to dry and burned – hence the fires. Later grass is sown, and cattle put on the deforested land to consolidate possession. This is “the classic cycle we have seen in recent years”, said Greenpeace Brazil senior forest campaigner, Adriana Charoux. If the farmer feels confident enough about his ownership of the land, the next stage is soya, she added. Soya production is growing in the Novo Progresso area, Menezes said, taking pride in the region improving productivity. Revealed: rampant deforestation of Amazon driven by global greed for meat The firefighters saving the forest It was striking to see how farming had eaten into the forest on both sides of the Cows were everywhere. Wildlife survived as best it could. One morning a white monkey scuttled across a dirt road, followed by a gaggle of forest pigs. Black, blue and orange macaws squawked atop a charred tree trunk, their only perch in a field of cattle. An opportunistic anteater darted across the highway in a gap between the trucks. All along the highway were signs of logging, including an enormous sawmill at Moraes Almeida and three clapped-out flatbed trucks parked up one morning without licence plates by a smaller sawmill at Vila Izol. Nearby were three swastikas daubed on a bar door. Logging was also evident in the Serra do Cachimbo Springs reserve – a hectare “biological reserve” created in which is also run by ICMBio. Driving down a dirt road in the reserve one morning we passed a man standing next to a motorbike as a lookout while chainsaws howled in the trees. It was a tense moment: environment officials warned that running into loggers in reserves, who are often armed, can be risky. When a convoy of government firefighters in hurtled past, we followed them into a farm registered on the CAR system in to André Ferri. Cattle grazed on pasture littered with old charred logs outside an empty farmhouse, surrounded by a curtain of forest. “All of this was burned, and this is a sensitive area,” said one of the firefighters, speaking anonymously because Bolsonaro government has banned environment agency employees from talking to the media. A few miles from here, a thousand hectares of Ferri farm was embargoed by ICMBio officials in April after being destroyed illegally and he was fined Four months later officials revisited the area and found the area had been burned and the area of devastation increased by more than hectares. A satellite image from when the reserve was created, found no deforestation in the embargoed areas. In Nasa satellites found fires around the same area. The farm limits have since been modified on the CAR system to exclude the embargoed area. Ferri has accumulated millions of pounds in fines, some of which were handed out after he broke previous embargoes and none of which has been paid. The neighbouring farm is owned by a transport company run by his brother Edner in Paraná state where André Ferri is also believed to live. Reached by phone on a Paraná number, he refused to answer questions. Brazil justice system has been unable to locate him to formally notify him of any of his fines. The firefighters headed deeper into the reserve to check an area that had been flagged for deforestation by satellites. Near a patch of houses there were freshly felled trees but no flames – yet. They raced off again, passing a charred clump of felled forest, over a rocky ridge and through more cattle farms before parking near a clearing pockmarked with blackened logs and trunks. Officials first came here last August following a deforestation alert and found a wooden house under construction, which they destroyed. Days later, the area was set on fire. The flames spread for miles and firefighters took days to bring the blaze under control. “This is an enormous loss for the environment,” one firefighter said. “It will take hundreds of years to recover.” As the fires raged, a woman calling herself Nair Brizola drove up to Brazilian reporters and told them that ICMBio officials had started it. Her story was widely circulated by Bolsonaro supporters and the president ordered an investigation. In nearly hectares of land including the scorched clearing where we stood was registered on the CAR system under the name Nair Rodrigues Petry. They are the same person. As Nair Brizola, Petry stood for the council of a town away and had offered a similar plot of land for sale on Facebook for around Brizola/Petry has since been fined for destroying hectares of forest using fire. In a telephone interview on the same mobile phone number that appeared on the Facebook land sale advert, Petry said she had documents proving the land had been hers since “When they came and created this reserve, we were already there,” she said. “Nobody is a crook.” She repeated her accusation that ICMBio officials had started the fire, denied offering the land for sale – and has not paid the fine. Petry said she was only just beginning to “mess” with the land. “In the future, the only thing we could do is pasture,” she said, meaning more cattle. “If I leave there, and leave it all abandoned, someone else will go in.” Revealed: fires three times more common in Amazon beef farming zones How ‘cattle laundering’ fuels the fires Brazilian meat companies have complex systems in place to prevent them buying from Amazon farmers facing fines and embargoes, like André Ferri. But farmers can avoid those checks by selling cattle to other farms for fattening, who then sell on to slaughterhouses – a triangulation process some environmentalists have dubbed “ cattle laundering”. Pressure is growing on meat companies that are largely unable to monitor all their “indirect suppliers ”. In the case of one company, Marfrig, “indirect suppliers” provide more than half of its cattle supplied from the Amazon. Research by Holly Gibbs, a professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin who monitors Amazon cattle supply chains, has found that from there were at least a hundred properties in the Jamanxim forest raising cattle – of them indirect suppliers. Gibbs team found another properties in Serra do Cachimbo involved in cattle production from including that were indirect suppliers. We had our answers: the farms we had managed to reach had illustrated the whole process. Fires – three times more common in Amazon cattle farming areas – are used to clear forest for pasture. Fragile law enforcement means fines are ignored. And when the loopholes that allow farmers to sell cattle raised on illegally burned or deforested land are taken into account, the future for Novo Progresso forests is not bright. Instead, it is black with smoke. It was dark when the firefighters’ convoy left, bouncing back down dirt tracks. A huge fire lit up the night sky: Petry neighbours burning more trees, the firefighters said. It was dark, and there was nothing they could do. We know why Amazon forests like this burn, but given Brazil current political situation, there are no solutions in view.",2521
25,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/covid-19-outbreaks-at-irish-meat-plants-raise-fears-over-worker-safety,"An outbreak of among workers in a meat factory in Tipperary has raised fears that the virus is spreading through abattoirs and meat-processing plants in Ireland . Sinn Féin spokesperson on agriculture, Brian Stanley, told the Irish parliament last night that workers at the Rosderra Meats plant in Roscrea had tested positive for the virus. He also said that of workers at the plant, up to were off sick last week. Rosderra is the largest pork-processing company in Ireland. Michael Creed, Ireland agriculture minister, told MPs that he was aware of six meat-processing plants with two or more confirmed cases of among workers, although he did not name them. Millions of farm animals culled as US food supply chain chokes up A spokesperson for Rosderra Meats confirmed to the Guardian that a number of employees had tested positive for coronavirus. They said that the company had implemented stringent measures to ensure the safety of employees, and added that production will be scaled down until all staff return to work. The news came as one of Ireland biggest beef companies announced a Covid-related shutdown. Dawn Meats said on Friday that it had temporarily closed its plant in Westmeath after four workers tested positive for coronavirus. Dawn Meats produces more than million burgers a year for McDonald outlets in the UK and Europe . In a statement, the company said that the plant had been closed “out of an abundance of caution”. It has yet to decide if it will reopen next week. Workers at other meat plants, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said they were frightened of contracting the virus, and expressed deep concern that social distancing is not being enforced on some factory floors. One said that “people are on top of each other, it like a cattle mart”. A complaint made to a line manager was ignored, they say. People are on top of each other, it like a cattle mart Anonymous meat plant worker The closure has raised deep concerns that Ireland export-driven agri-food sector will be severely hit by the pandemic. Agri-food is the most important domestic industry in the country, employing more than people. Produce is exported to more than countries and the sector is worth to the economy. The US, another country where the meat industry is a vital economic component with a powerful lobby, has been hit so hard by coronavirus-related closures that President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order to keep meat plants open. There are fears that prices and supply may be seriously disrupted. In Northern Ireland , union representatives are pushing owners to undertake full health and safety risk assessments at meat plants, following concerns that factories are not putting workers’ safety first. “Companies are not enforcing social distancing and definitely not providing enough PPE,” said Brian Hewitt of Unite, who said he was aware of positive cases of the virus in workers at meat plants in Armagh and Tyrone. “Workers are afraid of getting infected,” he said. In March, workers at the poultry processor Moy Park in Portadown walked out over fears that the company was putting employees at risk of infection. Sean McKevitt of Unite, who represents the workers, said on Friday that following negotiations with the company there was an “improved picture” for staff at Moy Park Dungannon and Portadown plants. Social distancing was in place, and workers had secured an additional a week payment. There are more than confirmed cases of in Ireland, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, and people diagnosed with the virus have died. The lockdown restrictions that were put in place to manage the spread of the virus are expected to remain for the coming weeks.",620
26,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/12/microplastics-discovered-blowing-ashore-in-sea-breezes,"Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of mismanaged waste could be blowing ashore on the ocean breeze every year, according to scientists who have discovered microplastics in sea spray. The study, by researchers at the University of Strathclyde and the Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées at the University of Toulouse, found tiny plastic fragments in sea spray, suggesting they are being ejected by the sea in bubbles. The findings, published in the journal Plos One, cast doubt on the assumption that once in the ocean, plastic stays put, as well as on the widespread belief in the restorative power of sea breeze. Around tons of plastic was manufactured globally in and some studies suggest as much as of it ends up in the sea each year. Steve Allen, a PhD candidate at Strathclyde who co-led the study, said: “Sea breeze has traditionally been considered ‘clean air’ but this study shows surprising amounts of microplastic particles being carried by it. It appears that some plastic particles could be leaving the sea and entering the atmosphere along with sea salt, bacteria, viruses and algae.” The “bubble burst ejection” of particles in sea fog or spray, described by Allen as “like soda in a glass when it hits your nose”, is a well-known phenomenon. But the new study is the first time microplastics have been shown to be ejected from the ocean. Microplastics disrupt hermit crabs' ability to choose shell, study suggests “We keep putting millions of tonnes of plastic into the ocean every year,” said Allen. “This research shows that it is not going to stay there forever. The ocean is giving it back to us.” Plastic debris, such as plastic bags and bottles, breaks down into smaller microplastic in the sea, often invisible to the eye. The microplastics in the sea spray were between five micrometres and up to micrometres long. The researchers estimated that up to tons of microplastic could be blown on shore by sea spray every year. Dr Deonie Allen, the study co-research lead, said this was the result of “our mismanaged waste that comes from the terrestrial environment”. She said the findings could help solve the mystery of where “missing” oceanic plastic goes after it leaks into the sea, a puzzle scientists have been trying to solve for years. “The transport mechanism is quite complicated” said Allen. “We know plastic comes out of rivers into the sea. Some goes into gyres, some sinks and goes into the sediment, but the quantity on the sea floor doesn’t match the amount of plastic that would make up this equation. There a quantity of missing plastic.” At least an estimated tonnes of plastic enters the sea from land and coasts every year. One study estimates just tonnes floats on the surface, leaving a puzzle as to where the rest goes. Various plastic ocean transport models have suggested “leaky basins” to explain areas that do not contain the quantities of plastic predicted. “We know plastic moves in the atmosphere, we know it moves in water,” Allen said. “Now we know it can come back. It is the first opening line of a new discussion.” The researchers captured water droplets from sea spray at Mimizan beach in Aquitaine, on the south-west Atlantic coast of France in the Bay of Biscay, using a “cloud catcher” and filters, set up on top of a sand dune. They analysed the water droplets for microplastics, sampling various wind directions and speeds, including a storm and sea fog. The sea fog generated by the surf produced the highest counts, of plastic particles per cubic metre of air. Previous studies, including one by the same authors that found microplastic pollution in a remote region of the Pyrenees mountains, have already shown that wind can transport microplastics in the atmosphere for long distances .",631
27,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/12/long-journey-home-the-stranded-sailboats-in-a-race-to-beat-the-hurricanes,"ith a non-stop solo sail across the Atlantic ahead of him, Garry Crothers is a little anxious. But he has to get moving before the hurricane season. “I’m in a bad place here, I don’t have any choice,” he says. Like many living aboard their sailing boats, he has been stranded at sea by The Irishman has been on Kind of Blue , his aluminium boat, for two months, hardly touching land. He anchored off Sint Maarten, in the Caribbean – a less pleasing prospect than it sounds. Hurricane season officially starts on June and the island, as Crothers is acutely aware, is “bang in the middle of the hurricane belt” – hit hard by Dorian last year, and Irma in Neighbouring countries and islands that might afford protection are shut. Crothers’ only safe option is a solo sail home to Ireland. In one sense he not alone. An estimated boats are crossing the Atlantic to Europe in the coming weeks. From the South Pacific to the Indian Ocean, thousands of people are trying to sail home or find shelter. While stranded cruise and navy ships have made headlines , far less attention has been paid to the plight of hundreds of families and individuals on small boats. As countries closed borders, numerous vessels were refused entry to their port of call. Even boats that had been safely anchored before the pandemic were suddenly considered a foreign yacht in territorial waters. Sailors in Portugal and Spain were ordered to return to home ports in the United States or Canada – a dangerous proposition without planning. From around the world, horror stories have emerged. Families with young children have been threatened with arrest, having their boats seized, or being towed out to open water for trying to anchor in sheltered bays, looking for food and water. Thousands have been left with nowhere to go and are undertaking risky passages. People sailing the coasts of Sri Lanka, India, and through the pirate-infested Gulf of Aden to the Horn of Africa, report being forced out to sea by navy gunboats patrolling coastlines. Many have been charged exorbitant prices for life-sustaining supplies as they rapidly run out of cash. Daria Blackwell of the Ocean Cruising Club (OCC) says risky journeys have become common: “One boat arrived in South Africa, was turned away and had to continue on to St Helena [a journey of more than nautical miles] running short of food, fuel and water,” she says. It was headed for the US but, with non-citizens onboard, not guaranteed entry. ‘No one comes': the cruise ship crews cast adrift by coronavirus The only place people can expect to be accepted – and therefore safe – is their home country. But that presents a problem of epic proportions. Many sailors are far from wealthy: their home is their boat, they hadn’t planned for a sudden ocean passage, and now have to cross in conditions they wouldn’t otherwise attempt. Lockdown means it has been impossible to source spares or safety gear ahead of the trip, while travel restrictions have meant many can’t get anyone to join as crew. And while most insurance policies stipulate certain crew numbers for the crossing, they also deny storm cover to boats left in hurricane zones. Like many others, Crothers has to choose the least worst option – face hurricane season or cross alone – both without cover. Even food provisioning is tricky. In Sint Maarten food shops have only recently reopened. “My other concern is trying to socially distance while getting supplies for the trip,” he says. “I’m in the age bracket where I can’t afford to get [coronavirus]. Or to get ill in the middle of the Atlantic.” In these difficult circumstances, sailors are turning to one another for support. They are a resourceful breed – offshore cruising demands it, given the myriad problems that can arise in the middle of the ocean. The OCC has connected more than boats in the west Atlantic heading for Europe: they’re sharing information and offering support on the crossing. This is not an organised flotilla – boats are leaving from as far afield as Antigua, Jamaica and Mexico to destinations ranging from Russia to the UK, Sweden to Greece. Skippers will make their own decisions on routes and speeds. If I go over, that it. It hard enough for an able man to get back on board – but with one hand? Garry Crothers, sailor However they’re jointly tracking journeys, so if problems arise there some prospect of help from others within range. In the first groups to leave, two boats with emergency medical workers and one with a surgeon onboard have offered assistance with medical support while at sea; one boat has helped another with water supply. Crothers has signed up to the list. He is an experienced sailor, but hasn’t done a transatlantic alone. The longest single-handed trip he done so far is five days. “Correction,” he says. “All my trips are single-handed.” After a car crash and years of pain, he had his left arm amputated in “My biggest worry is fixing things one-handed,” he says. “I’m pretty good, but it difficult without dropping things, and trying to hold on to the boat.” His first heading will be north, a route many are taking towards Bermuda. Once he has reached the high pressure area, he should pick up westerly winds to sail slowly towards the Azores. From there, he’ll head for Northern Ireland, taking more than three weeks. He has to sail conservatively. “Because if I go over, that it. It hard enough for an able man to get back on board – but with one hand?” The Azores have been a beacon of light in the Atlantic during this crisis. The archipelago, about nautical miles off the coast of Portugal, is of huge strategic importance for boats crossing west to east. Countries along the Atlantic eastern shores – Morocco, Senegal, Spain, Portugal, France – have been turning away boats looking for shelter. Island nations such as Cape Verde, off the coast of Africa, lack infrastructure and healthcare to deal with so are more understandably off limits. As Blackwell points out, “People are so panicked in countries that don’t have adequate healthcare, they will do anything to protect themselves.” But grateful sailors have been reporting that they could anchor in Horta, the Azores’ port, with access to fuel and water. The islands have a long history of welcoming boats on transatlantic passages, and maritime institution Peter Cafe Sport has been taking food, medical supplies and marine parts to anchored boats. As welcome as this is, lying at anchor doesn’t afford full protection from weather, or the opportunity to rest, make repairs and plan in the middle of exhausting passages. Which is why sailors have been lobbying governments. Sailor and journalist Ole Sal has formally applied to the regional governments of Madeira and the Azores, and to Portugal, France and Spain, to provide safe havens, arguing that the lack of open ports is “increasing the risk of loss of life and damage to vessels”. In Lisbon, yachtmaster Veronique Claus has written to Portugal president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, on behalf of international boats. “Certainly for those who are anchored in unsafe and non-sheltered waters, the situation is life-threatening,” she says, noting that two yachts have already been lost after breaking anchors. Crothers will pass near the Azores, but may not stop if restrictions mean he has to stay on anchor; dozens of others, however, including Britons Elena and John Nye , are counting on the stopover for fuel and water (their small boat won’t carry enough). The “relative newcomers” to sailing, set off from the British Virgin Islands for Norway on their sailboat, and hope to rest in the Azores before the onward journey. The Caledonian canal – a shortcut through the north of Scotland – is now closed, so they face a difficult passage via the Shetland Islands, where gale-force winds and perilous seas are common. They should get some shelter in the Western Isles, as the UK is operating some key ports and marinas for transit. What four years at sea taught me about our relationship to the ocean For those heading east towards Spanish and Portuguese coasts, and into the Mediterranean for France, Italy, Greece and elsewhere, it a mixed picture. Select ports are allowing entry with authorisation, but authorities are policing territorial waters vigorously and it could be costly to get it wrong. In Athens, several Greek crews sailed into a port during lockdown, were fined each by the coastguard and branded pirates in the national press. The Nyes are taking comfort from other boats making similar journeys. “It reassuring that there are others in the same daft situation,” John says. “It feels really good that in case of problems we can find out where the nearest boat is.” Crothers, whose final destination is Derry, Northern Ireland, is more circumspect. He is looking forward to a pint of Guinness, but the journey is long, and the illusion of strength in numbers falls away when you’re crossing the ocean in very different boats, with different speeds and routes. “Ultimately,” he says, “you’re alone out there.”",1537
28,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/cruise-companies-accused-of-refusing-to-let-stranded-crew-disembark-due-to-cost-coronavirus,"Some cruise companies have refused to agree to rules that would allow tens of thousands of stranded crew back to land, citing concerns about cost and potential legal consequences, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The largest trade association for the cruise industry has called the CDC requirements for disembarkation “impractical”. The standoff comes amid a deteriorating situation on many ships around the world and a rising death toll of crew members. More than crew workers are still trapped on cruise ships globally, at least of which have infections. This number includes around crew members on ships that are in international waters near the US waiting to disembark. Revealed: crew never made it off cruise ships amid coronavirus crisis Some major cruise operators have blamed the CDC for not allowing trapped crew to leave ships. But the health agency said it “stand[s] ready to approve these requests with same-day turnaround in most cases”, and has urged staff to contact cruise liners about disembarkation. The CDC confirmed it had detected hundreds of and Covid-like illness cases in crew since March in US waters, resulting in the deaths of at least six crew. A doctor on the Norwegian Gem, operated by Norwegian Cruise Line, died aboard the ship from a “respiratory illness” on Thursday. The Miami Herald obtained internal Norwegian Cruise Line documents confirming the doctor death and assuring crew on the ship that he had died in his sleep from “cardio-respiratory arrest”, but had “no symptoms of The Herald reported that the cruise company did not respond to their inquiries. Norwegian Cruise Line also did not respond to the Guardian request for comment. A third crew member on the Oasis of the Seas, currently off the coast of Florida, died in hospital on Sunday. The death of Carlos Baluran, who worked the night shift in the vessel incinerator, comes after the death of waiter Dexter Joyosa and Indonesian waiter Iputu Sugiartha in the last two weeks on the same ship. In a statement, the CDC told the Guardian that it is “allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in US waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members”. It said: “These requirements include ensuring safe transportation by non-commercial means, providing cloth face coverings to crew members or ensuring they have their own, and providing instructions to crew members to stay home for days after they reach their destination. “CDC shared this information with all cruise lines in US waters on April to help crew members return home safely. Since then, CDC has received and approved signed attestations to disembark crew from ships. 'We are very afraid': stranded cruise ship crew in limbo amid pandemic “Some cruise lines have been unwilling to comply with the requirements to safely disembark their crew. Reasons include unwillingness to sign the attestation because of the legal consequences, and not wanting to pay for noncommercial transportation.” But Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest trade association for the cruise industry, said some of the CDC requirements were “impractical”. “To require employers to guarantee that every employee outside the workplace will fulfil all of the CDC stated requirements, including not having any interaction with the public whatsoever , with criminal sanctions at stake, is both unprecedented and impractical,” it said in a statement. On Monday, the first wrongful death lawsuit for a crew member was filed on behalf of the family of an Indonesian housekeeper on the Symphony of the Seas, operated by Royal Caribbean. The suit alleges that the company failed to protect staff by not implementing social distancing measures on board by allowing crew to hold parties and eat together. The company replied in a statement that it was working with authorities around the world to repatriate thousands of staff. It confirmed it had agreed to CDC restrictions to repatriate staff, and said it declined to comment on pending litigation. Asked what support it was providing crew in the wake of the three deaths on the Oasis of the Seas, it said: “We have our Employee Assistance Program that crew can call hours a day and is confidential.” Carnival Cruise Line, which announced plans to restart operations at the beginning of August, said it would use ships to repatriate more than healthy crew members to Asia, Africa, Europe, India and Latin America. “The safety and wellbeing of our team members continues to be a top priority. Given the pause in our operations, we are committed to getting our crew members safely home to their families. We sincerely thank them for their hard work, patience and understanding during this process,” said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line. Alongside more than crew, CLIA confirmed that passengers remain at sea on five cruise ships – Celebrity Eclipse, Costa Deliziosa, Queen Mary Caribbean Princess and Coral Princess – as of April. So far, CLIA has recorded confirmed cases of onboard CLIA oceangoing cruise ships, but could not provide data relating to crew. “It a shame that it comes down to dollars and cents,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer in Miami, who has represented both the cruise companies and, most recently, cruise crew members. He said the situation facing crews now is rooted in the cruise industry avoidance of US governance. Even though the largest cruise lines are headquartered in the US and serve largely American clientele, they avoid US labour law and other regulation by registering outside the US and sailing their ships under foreign flags. “These crew members are like refugees now. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place,” he said. “The cruise lines think they can do anything they want with these folks and not treat them like human beings and not get them back to their homes.”",977
29,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/04/carnival-cruise-line-coronavirus-resume-operations,"Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the pandemic and investigations into the industry possible role in spreading the disease around the planet. In a statement on Monday, the operator said eight cruise ships would resume operations from August, sailing from Galveston, Texas, and Miami and Port Canaveral in Florida , once a no-sail order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had expired. Tasmania coronavirus outbreak traced to two Ruby Princess passengers The CDC has issued repeated warnings that cruise travel has spread the coronavirus outbreak around the world and on Friday, the US Congress announced an investigation of Carnival Cruise Line parent company – Carnival Corporation – over why it did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff. In response to the announcement, the CDC said it had not discussed timelines for resuming cruise travel with any operators, adding “we do not have enough information to say when it will be safe for cruise ships to resume sailing”. Dozens of people have died and more than confirmed infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival ships, which saw major outbreaks on the Diamond Princess , the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess . Carnival Cruise Line said it was “committed to supporting all public health efforts to manage the situation” in the statement to customers and travel agents announcing a limited resumption of its North America operations. “We are taking a measured approach, focusing our return to service on a select number of homeports where we have more significant operations that are easily accessible by car for the majority of our guests,” it continued. The CDC no-sail order was first issued on March amid rising concerns about how “cruise ship travel may continue to introduce, transmit, or spread The order was extended for days on April until July, prohibiting travel until is no longer a public health emergency or the CDC modifies the order based on specific public health advice. Revealed: crew never made it off cruise ships amid coronavirus crisis Alongside the announcement to resume operations, Carnival Cruise Line said it had cancelled all of its trips in July and extended the “pause” operations in all other North American and Australian markets until the end of August. “We will use this additional time to continue to engage experts, government officials and stakeholders on additional protocols and procedures to protect the health and safety of our guests, crew and the communities we serve,” the statement continued. In a statement, the CDC said it “is closely monitoring the situation on cruise ships while we review the cruise lines’ plans to prevent, detect, contain and respond to during the no-sail period. “CDC will continue to work with cruise lines to ensure all necessary public health procedures are in place when cruise lines do begin regular sailing. CDC has not consulted with any of the cruise lines on timelines for resuming cruise travel for passengers.”",501
30,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/15/keep-pet-cats-indoors-say-researchers-who-found-they-kill-230m-native-australian-animals-each-year,"Domestic cats are killing an estimated native Australian birds, reptiles and mammals every year, according to new research that quantifies the pet national toll on native animals for the first time. Researchers said owners of Australia domestic cats needed to make sure their pets were indoors or contained to reduce their impact on native species. As well as killing native animals, pet cats were also preying on about introduced animals – mostly rodents – the research found. Dr Sarah Legge, lead author of the study published in the journal Wildlife Research , told Guardian Australia: “If we want native wildlife in our towns and cities – rather than introduced rodents and birds – then there are choices to be made. “All we need to do is keep pet cats contained.” The research, funded by the Australian government National Environmental Science Program, reviewed data from more than studies on domestic cats. Parasitic disease spread by feral cats likely to be killing native wildlife Feral cats are a significant threat to Australia native animals but less is known about the hunting habits of pet cats. There are about feral cats in Australia, with numbers almost tripling during wet periods, said Legge. Understanding the impact of Australia pet cats has been harder to track than feral cats. Much analysis of the eating habits of feral cats is based on analysis of the stomachs of killed cats. The new analysis on pet cats drew on recent studies that had used a range of techniques to understand their hunting habits, including GPS trackers, video collars, analysis of scats and surveys of owners. The study found each feral cat kills an average native birds, mammals and reptiles per year, while pet cats kill an average of native animals every year – reptiles, birds and mammals. In total, this meant pet cats were killing native mammals, native birds and native reptiles every year. The study was not able to estimate the numbers of frogs and insects eaten by pet cats. Because pet cats live in higher densities, they were responsible for killing up to times more animals per square kilometre in residential areas than feral cats killed in out-of-town areas. “If we accept that feral cats in the bush are a problem, then we have to accept that pet cats in town are also a problem,” said Legge, of the University of Queensland. “But it easier for us to manage the impacts of pet cats than feral cats. Either keep them inside, or in secure pet runs outside.” In the study, researchers accounted for the numbers of pet cats that are contained – about – but warned there could actually be more roaming pet cats. One study carried out in Adelaide found more than one-third of pet cats were going out at night when their owners thought they were contained. The study also accounted for the known difference between the prey that pet cats brought home and analysis done of pet cat scats. This suggested roaming pet cats only brought home about of their prey. Legge said there was often an argument that pet cats helped keep rodents or sparrows under control, but she said there was little evidence to back this up. Legge said: “All cats will prefer a mammal if they can find one – animals like feathertail gliders, for example. For birds you could be talking about rosellas or fairy wrens. Cats will learn to stalk around bird feeders.” Australian government stops listing major threats to species under environment laws She said blue-tongue lizards and possums were also known prey items for pet cats. Cats that roamed at night tended to kill more mammals, while daytime roaming cats killed more reptiles and birds. She added: “If you have anywhere that prey animals are coming together, cats will get onto that very quickly.” According to guidance from the RSPCA , cats are healthier if kept at home and away from the risk of traffic accidents, insect and snake bites and fights with other cats and dogs. Dr Sarah Zito, senior scientific officer for companion animals at RSPCA Australia, said: “Contrary to what some might believe, cats do not need to roam to be happy. Indoor cats can live longer lives, protected from all these dangers. And, if provided with everything they need, they can be just as happy at home. “If your cat is a hunter, keeping them safely contained at home can also help to eliminate or minimise the risk they might pose to wildlife.” Sean Dooley, of BirdLife Australia, said the organisation welcomed the study, saying it was further confirmation that “both feral and domestic cats are a major threat to birds”. Dooley said it was likely domestic cats were a major contributor to the decline of smaller bird species in urban environments. He said there was evidence an entire colony of fairy terns – a nationally listed threatened species – had been wiped out by one feral cat and a domestic cat in Mandurah in Western Australia. He said the introduction of a cat curfew in Victoria Dandenong Ranges had helped superb lyrebirds to recover there. Holly Parsons, BirdLife Australia urban bird program manager, added: “Not only do domestic cats have an impact on native birds, keeping your cats inside and contained is healthier for them and they live longer. We want people to enjoy both our diverse and wonderful wildlife as well as their pet companions.”",905
31,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/07/pollutionwatch-breathtaking-views-vanish-build-better-coronavirus,"any of us will have noticed differences in traffic noise and air pollution during the lockdown. Startling images have come from India where, for the first time in a generation, the Himalayas have been visible more than a hundred miles away. Something similar happened in the UK in when coal shortages during a miner strike led to newspaper reports of distant landmarks being visible as never before. In the UK we too have been able to look up at clearer blue skies , less impeded by air pollution and not crisscrossed by aircraft contrails. This helped Germany to break a solar power record . In Beijing, air pollution controls for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting also brought a return to blue skies. The term “APEC blue” emerged in Chinese social media and was nominated as Beijing top environmental phrase for the year. Later it took on a tinge of sadness, to mean something wonderful, but brief. One woman posted about love on social media, “He not that into you – it just an APEC blue!” Rather than let this time be forgotten, the United Nations and environmental campaigners are urging governments to “build back better, to invest in the future not the past”, to ensure that our global recovery has sustainable legacy.",213

He was tested within hours – the result was positive. “One hundred per cent, I know I got it in the factory,” he says. “If the disease was in the animals, they’d have closed the place. But for workers, the factories can do what they want.” Marco is one of a number of workers who have contacted the Guardian about conditions in some meat plants since the pandemic began. Speaking on condition of anonymity, workers in factories across Ireland and Northern Ireland say that not enough was done at the start of the outbreak to minimise their exposure, and that though some protective measures are now in place, they still don’t feel safe at work. For Marco, who has worked at the same factory for more than a decade, it too little, too late. “I felt frightened, “ he says. “The damage has been done.” When you see the conditions – it a dirty and nasty place, nobody is happy Florin Life as a meat plant worker is a low-wage, bloody business, workers told the Guardian. “It horrible killing cows, when you see how they do it,” says Florin*, a Romanian worker who has been employed in a meat plant in the Republic of Ireland for more than five years said. “They kill it – shoot it, cut the neck, cut the legs. I don’t like it. The cow is slow, an emotional thing. And you see the blood, and they go from being alive to being in pieces. That the way. When you see the conditions – it a dirty and nasty place, nobody is happy.” Temperatures in the factories can hover at with industrial ceiling fans that circulate cool air to keep the meat free of microbes. The job is repetitive and tough; workers take painkillers to get through their shifts. Now countries across the world with industrialised meat supply chains are grappling with serious coronavirus outbreaks in meat and processed food plants. Official figures show that there have been outbreaks at plants in the Republic of Ireland and workers have tested positive . In Northern Ireland, union officials have raised serious concerns , and last week one worker died. Workers point to bottlenecks in toilets and washrooms; the locker-rooms, where workers pile in before and after work; and the canteens, where they gather to eat. The greatest risks are during eight-hour shifts on the factory floor where they work half a metre or less apart from colleagues on the production line. 'Chaotic and crazy': meat plants around the world struggle to contain outbreaks They say factories have not been making sure that workers had personal protective equipment, or abiding by social distancing guidelines. “There was no social distancing,” says Marco. “You had to go through areas where everyone was on top of themselves, sneezing and coughing.” “They didn’t give us masks or gloves. We had to buy our own,” said Florin. “People are scared, they say it not safe.” On top of the lack of safety equipment, the fact that migrants make up the vast majority of the workforce in the meat industry is also a problem, with many travelling from Timor-Leste, Lithuania, China, Poland, South Africa, Romania, Bulgaria and Brazil to work. Marco says that in his factory not enough information was given to non-English speakers about how they could keep themselves – and those around them – safe from infection. I’m so angry – how can a government allow this? They forgot about us, they did not care Marco In general, migrant workers have settled well into Irish life. Pablo*, who was recruited from his home town in Africa, says he has always felt welcomed by local people. But in the factory, where he earns about an hour, life is hard. Workers feel intimidated and vulnerable, and are unable to stand up for their legal rights, he says. “People are not being treated with dignity and respect.” Pablo says that until a few weeks ago, apart from posting government notices about on the walls, his factory didn’t put anything in place to protect its workers. “There was no checking of temperature, no masks, no social distancing. When we asked for masks, they said no.” He says he he doesn’t feel safe at work, and is sure that he will get infected with the virus. “New workers are brought in to replace people who are out sick, but we don’t know if they’ve been screened.” Because of their low pay, many migrant workers live in communal houses and some have to share bedrooms. “They don’t feel safe, but they have to work,” says Adriana*, a Polish worker at a meat factory in Northern Ireland. There are perspex screens in parts of the factory and workers’ temperatures are now checked, but there is still no distancing inside the factory, and workers are afraid. Santos*, a Brazilian worker in a meat plant south of the border, says that many of his fellow workers have poor levels of English and aren’t aware of their rights, such as welfare support if they are sick. “If these people have the virus, who will help them? How will they get food?” Following his positive diagnosis for the virus, Marco is now recovering at home. He gets a weekly payment from the government, and he says his health is OK. But he wants an investigation into what has gone on in the meat factories. “I’m so angry – how can a government allow this? They forgot about us, they did not care. It shocking.” * Names have been changed We want to hear from you about your experiences and stories from inside the farming industry. Please get in touch .

33,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/14/deaths-and-hunger-strikes-point-to-mental-health-crisis-on-stranded-cruise-ships,"Several deaths, a hunger strike and disturbances on board cruise ships have raised fresh concern about what crew members say is the deteriorating mental health of staff stranded aboard cruise ships still floating at sea. A worldwide standoff between cruise companies and health authorities has left approximately crew stranded at sea . Many have spent more than a month self-isolating in cabins, unable to leave, and have lost their jobs during the pandemic. On Sunday, a Ukrainian woman died after apparently jumping from the Regal Princess outside the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands . Dutch police confirmed the death of a woman. Princess Cruises, part of Carnival Corporation, said support was being offered to staff and the family of the deceased. On the Navigator of the Seas off the coast of Miami, Romanian crew started a hunger strike in protest at not being able to disembark. Royal Caribbean said the strike ended after a charter flight was arranged from Barbados later this month. Many other ships remain marooned around the world. In the Philippines, Manila Bay has more than cruise ships with around staff on board waiting for clearance to disembark. In Germany, police in the Germany port of Cuxhaven were called on board the Mein Schiff last week after reports of disturbances. Nearly crew members from several ships had been assembled onboard awaiting repatriation to numerous countries, but were told they would have to stay on the ship after nine people tested positive for The deaths and conflicts have prompted renewed warnings about the mental health of crew stuck at sea waiting for permission to return home. Cruise lines were managing to repatriate small contingents of crew members to some Caribbean countries by Tuesday, but even those efforts raised consternation in Haiti and Grenada after reports of some crew not being put into the required quarantines, according to reports in the Miami Herald. Cruise companies have blamed strict rules from health authorities for not letting crew disembark. In and around US waters, cruise ships with crew are still waiting at sea, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told the Guardian that some operators have opted to stay at sea , citing concerns about cost and potential legal consequences. Crew members stranded at sea have said the experience has taken its toll on their mental health. Will Lees, a Canadian who was hired to run art shows and gallery sales on the Norwegian Star starting last October, said the waiting and uncertainty have been deeply unsettling. He has not been on land since passengers left the ship on March and has been shuffled between three ships to await repatriation. He was on the Norwegian Epic on Friday at dock in Miami, but has since been moved to a new ship that is now sailing him to Europe . From there he has been told he will be flown back to Canada. “Each day you have no real purpose. It the same as the day before,” he said in a WhatsApp message sent from the middle of the Atlantic, somewhere near the Bermuda triangle. “You feel like you’re giving up your life and doing the same thing over and over again. It depressing.” In response to concerns about the mental health of staff, Royal Caribbean said: “The health and safety of our crew is our top priority and we are working around the clock to make sure they get home safely. We have an employee assistance programme that crew are able to call hours a day and is fully confidential.” Carnival Corporation said: “We provide all employees complimentary access to our employee assistance programme (EAP), which includes a variety of services, and credentialed counsellors. In addition, our onboard medical team is trained to identify guests and crew who might need additional resources and support.” Tui said it has since been able to send crew on the Mein Schiff home on charter flights carrying only workers who have tested negative. “TUI Cruises was and is in daily contact with the ship management. We are aware of the tense situation of some crew members who had been waiting for their return journey for a long time and we try to support the crew in all matters in this uncertain situation. “The ship management informs the crew on a regular basis: up-to-date information on the situation is communicated by the captain via shipboard announcements and is displayed on all screens on board for reading. In order to address and support the crew in this exceptional situation, TUI Cruises has – among other things – also initiated assistance in the field of maritime psychosocial emergency care for the crew on board as well as for the ones isolated on land.” Prof Ann Kring, who chairs the psychology department at the University of California, Berkeley, said the long-running uncertainty and lack of control facing crews stranded on ships presents the sort of “horrific” situation that could cause anxiety in anyone. “They are stuck, they have no information, they don’t know whether the person in the next room is sick or whether they will get sick or whether they ever get home,” she said, noting that crew members may also face loss of jobs and uncertain financial futures. “The limbo that they are in is not only anxiety-producing, it could be traumatic in the long term.” She said getting people off the ships, so they could get the fresh air, exercise and healthy food recommended for everyone in isolation, would be a good start to helping them cope with the situation. “It taking way too long,” she said. Royal Caribbean also confirmed the death of a crew member on the Mariner of the Seas, currently stationed near the Bahamas, but said the death appeared to be from natural causes. It said it had planned to have many crew members heading home last week, but its efforts were delayed by “external restrictions”. “We had multiple charters ready for crew. However, due to external restrictions, crew members were not permitted to leave the ship and also could not take commercial flights,” a spokesperson said, adding that the company was working “around the clock” to get crew home. Krista Thomas, a former cruise ship employee, has been running a Facebook group to update hundreds of crew members at sea about how to get home. Many have expressed concerns about their mental health. “If they have a window to look out of, they’re looking out at this dark ocean – wondering when they’ll see land, when they’ll go home, how their family is doing, if they’ll be able to provide for them,” she said. “When you’re sitting in a room with nothing to go to and no one to talk to, disconnected from your family, then it only takes something small to spiral.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie .

34,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/14/seeds-of-hope-on-a-mission-to-protect-tasmanias-ancient-pencil-pines,"unched against the wind in Tasmania central highlands are the floral relics of the last ice age. Walking among them, armed with a large pole and a cloth bag, is James Wood, the coordinator of the Tasmanian seed bank. It is the first time in five years that Tasmania conifers have seeded, and he is determined not to miss it. It is the third week of April. A coronavirus outbreak has occurred in Tasmania north-west, causing the premier to close two regional hospitals and place health workers and their families in quarantine . And Wood is walking a deserted stretch of the Overland Track, alone but for Justin Dyer, his guide from the Tasmanian Walking Company, in search of stands of pencil pines, or Athrotaxis cupressoides . On an ordinary day, the Overland Track carries hikers. But the national parks are closed and travel banned due to the coronavirus, so for five days Wood and Dyer see no one except for a few park rangers, dozens of pademelons (a squat, short-tailed wallaby) and a hungry platypus that ignored them in favour of hunting in a tarn, two humans being no competition to the lure of a full belly. “It was just incredibly quiet,” Wood says. “You do get this feeling of real privilege that you’re getting that place pretty much to yourself.” The pencil pines are one of five species of conifer endemic to Tasmania high country, the most well-known of which are king billy pines ( Athrotaxis selaginoides ). They are the last remnants of the Gondwana forest, from a genus that is at least years old. World heritage forests burn as global tragedy unfolds in Tasmania The trees are not listed as threatened because they are not uncommon within their ecosystems, but that could change any given summer. Stands of pencil pines and cheshunt pines at Lake Mackenzie were destroyed when a fire raced down the Devil Gullet in . Stands of king billy pines were also lost. “The reality is that if fire frequency increases in these upland areas, and that seems very likely, that could change very quickly,” Wood says. “So what we are trying to do here is act preemptively and get seed collections in place when we can.” The Tasmanian pines are more dispersed and their habitat wilder, making a rescue effort like that which saved the ancient Wollomi pines in the New South Wales Blue Mountains this summer more difficult . “It does make them very vulnerable,” Wood says. Pencil pines and other Athrotaxis produce seeds only every few years, as part of a global masting event that triggers sudden seed production in unrelated plants around the world. The last masting event was in The trigger, says Wood, appears to be two successively hotter summers, although there no consensus on the exact cause. This year the seeding was “patchy”, with pencil pines on higher and drier areas not producing pine cones, and cheshunt pines, which often grow nearby, not seeding at all. It means that while Tasmania will likely deliver on the prerequisite for hotter summers, due to the climate emergency, the accompanied drying out of the highlands could leave the pencil pines too stressed to seed. That is why the masting was so important. An ambitious plan involving teams of volunteers, visiting specialists from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh, helicopters and arborists was formed in December and tree enthusiasts on Facebook were mobilised to monitor conifer flowering. Those plans were spiked when the pandemic was declared, and Wood got permission for the two-person operation focused just on the pencil pines. 'Dinosaur trees': firefighters save endangered Wollemi pines from NSW bushfires Pencil pines are particularly tricky for seed gatherers, because they grow in the wild as suckers. “Most of the stands of the trees that you see in Tasmania are all clonal,” Wood says. “They sucker from their roots and spread that way so large strands of trees generally have only a couple of individuals. You may see several hundred trees but there may be only a dozen or less individuals in that stand.” They walked over the five days, gathering two handfuls of pine cones from each of the stands visited to ensure the seeds collected were genetically diverse. At the end, the bank was seeds richer. “Unfortunately we have missed all the other opportunities we had,” Wood says. “Hopefully when the next masting event takes place those stands will still be there and still be happy.”",746
35,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/15/nsw-south-coast-residents-battling-to-save-unburnt-bushland-ask-sussan-ley-to-intervene,"A dispute over plans by a property developer to raze a local forest on the bushfire-ravaged south coast of New South Wales has been escalated to the federal environment minister amid concerns the project could threaten endangered species. Residents of Manyana have been protesting against plans by Ozy Homes to clear hectares of unburnt mature-growth forest to make way for nearly housing lots. They are opposed to the development given that so much local bushland has been burned. Spared by the fires, NSW south coast bushland now faces the bulldozers Ozy Homes was due to start clearing the forest in Manyana last week but agreed to pause work until Monday to allow for discussions, the community group Manyana Matters said in a statement this week. But after a meeting on Wednesday between Ozy Homes, the NSW planning minister, Rob Stokes, and representatives from Shoalhaven city council, the group on Thursday said the developer had shown “no indication ... that they are willing to further delay the start of work on this project”. Manyana Matters has now engaged the Environmental Defenders Office to act on its behalf, with letters sent to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley , and the director of Ozy Homes. The community group wants the development – approved by the NSW government in – referred to Ley for assessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, saying it could affect a number of threatened species, including the critically endangered swift parrot. Apart from experts finding the project will directly impact listed species by clearing bushland that provides key areas of habitat, the site “is now surrounded by fire-affected forest and has become an important refuge for wildlife”, the letter to Ley says. “The EDO has informed us there is a strong chance this project may be in breach of the [act], given the presence of threatened species on the land slated for development,” Manyana Matters said. The organisation will call on Ley “to invoke her powers under the Act to delay this project until a proper assessment can be completed”. In the letter to Ozy Homes, the EDO said it was under instructions to seek an assurance that the developer would refer the project to Ley and that no work would start until a determination has been made. Ozy Homes and Ley have been contacted for comment. Australian government stops listing major threats to species under environment laws More than people have also signed a Change.org petition calling for a halt to the land clearing to prevent any harm to the greater glider, which is listed as vulnerable. And there are calls for the state government to order Forestry Corporation to abandon plans to log Nambucca state forest on the NSW north coast. “Logging these forests after so many were devastated in the summer bushfires is morally indefensible,” said the Nature Conservation Council chief executive, Chris Gambian. “Trees that are habitat for a wide range of native animals, including the greater glider, sooty owl and koalas, will be cut down to make telegraph poles, pool decking and pallets.”",512

The environment minister, Sussan Ley , said of the new funds would be for on-ground recovery work in fire-affected regions, including in vulnerable areas of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area and in rainforests on the NSW north coast. The money will be spent over two years from July and is in addition to the initial announced in January to support wildlife recovery. BBC Andrew Cotter commentates penguin parade on Australia Phillip Island Ley said it would benefit species including the koala, the Kangaroo Island dunnart and the northern corroboree frog, as well as plant life including the Wollemi pine . “We have listened to the experts from the wildlife and threatened species bushfire recovery expert panel, from wildlife carers, conservation organisations and community groups,” Ley said. “Since our initial package which has delivered much needed relief for volunteers, land managers, seed banks, veterinarians and zoos, we have been clear that more money would be forthcoming and we intend to put it to the best possible use, using expert advice.” Conservation groups have welcomed the announcement, with the Australian Conservation Foundation describing it as a “sizeable investment in ecosystem and wildlife recovery”. “The funding will help with restoration, erosion control, weed and pest management, and should assist species such as the Kangaroo Island dunnart, the northern corroboree frog, koalas and more,” policy analyst James Trezise said. But organisations said funding should be matched by work to improve Australia conservation protections. They noted that in the aftermath of the fires unburnt habitat had already been opened up for logging . Australia Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is currently subject to a once-in-a-decade review. Conservationists said the review was an opportunity to strengthen protections for species and critical habitat and ensure policies were in place to address the threat of more frequent natural disasters in a warming world. Trezise said the review was an important opportunity for the “Morrison government to build a stronger legal framework with emergency protection for critical habitats to better protect remaining unburnt areas”. “The truth is Australia laws are not adequately protecting native species and their homes,” he said. Tim Beshara, the federal policy director at the Wilderness Society, said the organisation submission to the bushfires royal commission recommended the government establish a nature recovery fund specifically to deal with climate-related disasters. “These bushfires aren’t a standalone event, there will be more and we need to be ready to roll immediately every time this happens,” Beshara said. “These fires started in August and the majority of funding won’t hit the ground until after July Beshara said the organisation was also concerned the government had not developed a policy response to the environmental impact of the fires outside of the grant funding. “These fires have been the largest single catastrophic event for terrestrial biodiversity in generations and it hasn’t instigated a single change to government policy in how they protect and manage nature,” he said. Fear of flying foxes: coronavirus is topping off a bad year for Australia bats Responses to written questions from a Senate estimates committee show the government had spent of the initial announced in January for wildlife as at April. In its response, the department said a total of more than of the had been committed to projects. Labor environment spokeswoman Terri Butler said the additional funding for wildlife was welcome but the opposition was “deeply sceptical about the government announcement”. Butler said the environment department had suffered multiple budget cuts under Coalition governments and the government had not moved quickly enough to get money out the door for the fire recovery. “Scott Morrison has rushed to the nearest podium for a press conference, but has been devastatingly slow to act on bushfire recovery,” Butler said. Analysis for the federal government has found vertebrate species , nearly invertebrates and more than plants need urgent assistance in the aftermath of the fires.

I pass the same fences, walls and driveways, listening for the songs and calls of birds where I’ve heard them in the past: the garden fir tree that held goldcrests, the bushes behind the fencing by the railway line that sheltered bullfinches. But tonight each blackbird, blue tit and song thrush seems louder, their songs more pure, full of meaning. I pass the spot where a lone bramble bush – now tidied away – hid a grasshopper warbler one spring morning, seven years ago. I had listened to its unmistakable metallic reeling song through the noise of the busy traffic whizzing past. It stayed for just one day before it moved on. Within a few minutes, I’m walking between the houses on the edge of town, built five years ago where nightingales once sang, and into the fields lined on one side by woodland. I’ve walked here each spring since, in the hope the nightingales would return. Today, the hedgerows are ringing with blackcaps and, further away from the town, there are the similar but more flutey songs of garden warblers . I exchange smiles at a respectful distance with a family walking their dog. Then, from somewhere over the hedges, I hear a long, repeating note – pure and piercing – getting louder. The nightingale stops, then warbles again, and trills. I follow the footpaths towards the song, until I come to a field of young trees and sprawling clumps of brambles. The white rumps of rabbits bob away from me. The nightingale is singing from within some dense bushes on the other side of the field. I listen for a while before deciding, reluctantly, that it time to head back. Orange lines streak across the darkening blue sky. The leaves of the oak tree in the middle of the field shake in the rising wind, and clouds hustle into view as the sun sets. I pass the fencing by the railway line again. Somewhere, deep in the impenetrable vegetation on the other side, another nightingale is giving its recital. There silence, then the long, repeated note grows louder and louder, and the bird moves on to virtuoso flurries. The large, round moon shines above the rooftops.",382

It was just past midday. The sun beat down on the water over which danced or fluttered insects that a moment or two before had ended the nymph stage of their life cycle. Almost incredulously we watched three sleek heads emerge; we could scarce believe that at this time of day a mother and two half-grown cubs were showing their faces in freedom from disturbance and danger. The cubs, after their hours of confinement in a holt under a sycamore, were in a mood for high jinks. They romped like puppies, seizing each other by the scruff of the neck in a determination to down and hold each other under the water until one should ask for mercy. All this to the accompaniment of squealing and snorting, the sound of which stirred the curiosity and anxiety of the nesting sandpipers and waterhens. Tummy rumbles? Otters juggle pebbles when hungry, study finds The mother otter meantime was too busy diving for eels and munching them as they writhed in her jaws to give more than a casual glance at her charges.

In it, I grow species of wildflowers, with many such as pignut, sanicle and harebell found just outside the boundary walls. The leaves and roots of these wildlings provide food for the larval stages of insects, in particular the moths that I study by using a light trap once a week. Their flowers feed the adults and the garden is rich with bees, butterflies, beetles, flies and other invertebrates. Adding to these wild species are some quirky variations that I enjoy for their sometimes weird shapes. Unusual colours and double forms have been sought-after for centuries, often occurring naturally and spotted by keen gardeners. It was in an Oxfordshire lane years ago that the Northumberland botanist John Richards, when leading a group looking at dandelions, noticed a newly emerged cow parsley with deep purple foliage .

40,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/12/us-fossil-fuel-companies-coronavirus-bailout-oil-coal-fracking-giants-bond-scheme,"Fossil fuel companies and coal-powered utilities in the US are set for a potential bonanza under federal government plans for a bond bailout, part of the rescue package for the coronavirus crisis. At least fossil fuel companies, many of them established giants such as ExxonMobil, Chevron and Koch Industries, stand to gain from the Federal Reserve coronavirus bond buyback programme , alongside more than utilities including coal-heavy firms such as American Electric Power and Duke Energy, according to a new analysis. The bond buyback scheme is expected to be worth at least altogether and to benefit thousands of companies by the end of September, and the size of the payout that could go to fossil fuels and utilities is as yet unknown. The scheme is to be discussed in the US Senate on Tuesday . Jason Disterhoft, a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network , which conducted the analysis, said public money should be used to bail out companies only with strict conditions attached. “Our concern is that these recovery funds should be prioritising people and communities and they are going instead to big companies to pay down their debts,” he said. Ten out of the top fracking companies would be eligible to apply, according to the analysis, which examined all US fossil fuel companies and energy utilities to check whether they would qualify under the published scheme rules. It is not known whether any of these companies will apply for the support, though many are expected to do so. The plunge in oil prices has thrown oil companies into disarray, while dropping energy use because of the crisis has also had an impact on coal-fired power plants and utilities. “The recovery is a choice between propping up the fragile fossil fuel industry and building the resilient green economy we need. The list of who is eligible for the Fed massive bond purchase programmes, including struggling frackers, coal companies and supermajors, shows what at stake,” said Disterhoft. “Recovery funds have to go to workers and environmental clean-up first, not bonuses or dividends, and companies should be required to stop expanding fossil fuels and phase out their fossil business – otherwise we’re just lighting public money on fire and locking in the coming climate crash into the bargain.” A separate study last week by economists and Oxford University found that putting public money into a green recovery would produce higher economic returns and create more jobs in both the short and longer term than pouring the same money into the current fossil fuel economy. Fossil fuel firms linked to Trump get millions in coronavirus small business aid Experts and campaigners around the world have called for governments to focus the recovery on greener growth as a way to generate jobs, revive the global economy and prevent greenhouse gas emissions from rising further as the pandemic subsides. To be eligible for the Federal Reserve scheme – which is to be administered by BlackRock, the asset manager that this year pledged to shift its investment strategy to take account of the climate crisis – companies must have had a or higher credit rating as of March. There are moves to change the rules to allow companies that had such a credit rating earlier, on March, to apply. According to the analysis, this would allow another oil and gas company, Occidental Petroleum, to qualify.",560
41,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/gas-stoves-air-pollution-environment,"Gas stoves are making people sick, contributing pollution that makes indoor air up to two to five times dirtier than outdoor air, according to a new report. Microplastics found in greater quantities than ever before on seabed Despite the risks, regulators have failed to set standards for indoor air quality – a problem that is now likely to be exacerbated by large numbers of people spending time inside and cooking at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Fossil-fuel-burning stoves are likely exposing tens of millions of Americans to air pollution levels that would be illegal if they were outside, concludes the review of decades of science by the Rocky Mountain Institute and multiple environmental advocacy groups. Lead report author Brady Seals said little attention has been paid despite longstanding knowledge of the problem. “Somehow we’ve gotten accustomed to having a combustion device, often unvented, inside of the home,” Seals said. About a third of US households cook primarily with gas – which emits nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, in addition to the particle pollution that all types of stoves produce. Older, poorly maintained stoves pollute even more including risks from carbon monoxide. Even small increases in short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide can increase asthma risks for children. One analysis found that children in homes with gas stoves have a higher chance of having asthma symptoms. Another in Australia attributed of all childhood asthma burden to gas stoves. Nitrogen dioxide also makes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease worse and may be linked to heart problems, diabetes and cancer. Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause a headache, nausea, a rapid heartbeat, cardiac arrest and death. The best solution, according to the report, is to change to electric stoves. But individuals with gas stoves can also open windows, cook on their back burners, use an exhaust hood, run an air purifier with a HEPA filter and install a carbon monoxide detector. Indoor air pollution hits poor Americans and people of color worse because they are often also exposed to lead, mercury, highways and industrial plants, said Dr Robert Gould, a California pathologist and board member for Physicians for Social Responsibility who peer-reviewed the report. “We just need to make these investments,” Gould said. “This fits into an overall plan we would have to protect, particularly, our vulnerable populations.”",382

Melinda Pierce, the legislative director for the Sierra Club, said: “The federal money Congress appropriated should be going to help small businesses and frontline workers struggling as a result of the pandemic, not the corporate polluters whose struggles are a result of failing business practices and existed long before entered the public lexicon.” More than Democratic lawmakers have argued that fossil fuel companies should not get any assistance under the coronavirus aid package. Some Democrats have also warned the forgivable loans being made under Congress’ Paycheck Protection Program could be a transparency disaster. Banks and lending institutions are distributing the money, so the government says it cannot track recipients in real time. The loans revealed have been made public only through news reports and securities filings by publicly-traded companies, although the Federal Reserve has committed to issuing monthly reports. So far, it clear the program is not working as intended. The funds are aimed at helping small businesses to keep paying their employees and covering other recurring expenses during the economic downturn. But they have been exploited by large companies forced to return the money amid a public outcry, including the Los Angeles Lakers, Shake Shack and Ruth Chris Steak House. The industry aid comes as the Trump administration is reportedly considering a broader bailout for oil and gas corporations, which were already under pressure before the coronavirus and have watched oil prices nosedive because of a global price war and low demand for gasoline. The US government could make loans to oil and gas companies, essentially making taxpayers investors in the industry. The Federal Reserve on Thursday also announced changes to its lending rules that could help indebted petroleum firms. “The idea that oil workers are getting a paycheck is great,” said Jamie Henn, a spokesman for the Stop the Money Pipeline campaign who co-founded the environment group “The worry is that the money going to the top and not going to filter down.” The already paid to fossil fuel companies is a small fraction of the the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the Cares Act. But the total assistance to the industry is likely much larger than can currently be tallied and will continue to grow. Environmental advocates and oversight experts tracking the funds say it impossible to count how much of the money will assist fossil fuels, including because some firms provide services across multiple industries. “All of this is voluntary disclosures by the companies,” said Jesse Coleman, a senior researcher with Documented. “No matter what, it going to be an incomplete picture of what going on.” Coleman said in many cases the fossil fuel companies getting aid have made bad investments and “now they’re going to come crawling hat in hand and say: look at what the coronavirus did to us”. It both a bad financial proposition of the Fed and for taxpayers, and a bad situation for the planet Graham Steele Among the coronavirus aid recipients is Hallador Coal, an Indiana-based coal mining company that hired Donald Trump former environment chief Scott Pruitt as a lobbyist.

Coal mining company Rhino Resources, which was formerly run by Trump Mine Safety and Health Administration head, David Zatezalo, is receiving Coal firm Ramaco Resources, whose CEO, Randy Atkins, is on the energy department National Coal Council , is getting The US coal industry has been in steep decline, driven out of the market by cheap natural gas and environmental concerns. Trump campaigned on putting coal miners back to work, and his agencies have unsuccessfully explored ways to bail out coal companies, which are seeing their lowest employment levels in modern history. The Trump administration has also rescinded nearly all of the environment and climate protections the fossil fuel industry has opposed. Fossil fuel companies can also take advantage of tax benefits under the coronavirus legislation, including deferring payment of social security and medicare taxes. The Missouri-based Peabody Energy coal company has said it will speed up collecting an alternative minimum tax refund of to and defer of owed taxes. US taxpayers already subsidize the fossil fuel industry at roughly a year, according to conservative estimates . The Center for International Environmental Law has accused the oil, gas and plastics industries of “exploiting the crisis by aggressively lobbying for massive bailouts and special privileges in a desperate attempt to revive an oil and gas industry already in decline”. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis argues that federal lending to the oil and gas sector would be “a complete waste of money ”, because it wouldn’t fix the industry underlying financial problems. Oil industry lobbyists have pushed for changes at the Federal Reserve to let companies with large amounts of debt use its Main Street Lending Program and borrow to pay off existing loans. In an April letter to the Federal Reserve, the oil trade group the Independent Petroleum Association of America asked for the new provisions, saying “oil and natural gas producers are not looking for a government handout; they are seeking a bridge to help survive this economic disruption.” Environmental advocates say the move would disproportionately benefit small and mid-sized oil and gas companies , such as Occidental Petroleum, which has nearly in liabilities on its balance sheet. California closes Orange county beaches over fears – but how risky is a beach day? Graham Steele, who directs the corporations and society initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, called the situation the “classic disaster scenario where an opportunistic administration and industry is taking advantage of a crisis”. “And by the way, these are industries driving climate change.

Slightly more than half of the company investors who gave a view supported a motion that it set targets in line with the goals of the Paris climate agreement to cut both its own emissions and the “scope emissions released by consumers of its products, many of them in Asia. The motion also called on Woodside to release details of how its planned new multibillion-dollar gas investments, which have stalled until next year due to the pandemic , would align with the Paris goals of limiting warming to well below and whether its remuneration policy encouraged executives to ensure emissions targets were met. Australia booming LNG industry stalls after fall in oil prices amid coronavirus Activists said it was the first time a climate resolution had received more than support in a vote by Australian fossil fuel company shareholders. Woodside is Australia largest oil and gas company. The vote follows support for a similar motion among shareholders of the country second biggest oil and gas company, Santos, earlier this month. Neither vote was binding – the motions were not formally put after earlier votes to change the companies’ constitutions to allow advisory resolutions failed – but the strength of support for greater climate action among shareholders surprised even activists. Dan Gocher, from shareholder activist group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the support for its motion from of Woodside shareholders was striking given the company board had opposed it. “This is a breakthrough moment for investor action on climate change in Australia,” he said. “Until Woodside explains how its business will align with the goals of the Paris agreement, the company will be in open conflict with the majority of its shareholders. This is an untenable position for the company.” Almost half of all shareholders at Santos AGM back stronger emissions target A second resolution calling on Woodside to review its links to groups that lobby on behalf of fossil fuel companies, such as the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, received support from voting shareholders. Both motions were supported by several large proxy advisers, including ACSI, Glass Lewis, ISS, PIRC and Regnan. Woodside chief executive, Peter Coleman, said the company acknowledged investor and community interest in “the challenge of climate change”. The company says it aims to reach net zero emissions for its own operations by but argues gas, as a fossil fuel that releases less when burned than coal, is a solution to global heating. “We’ll continue this conversation as our business plays its role in supplying reliable energy while supporting progress towards a lower carbon world,” Coleman told the meeting, which was held online due to the coronavirus pandemic . Fuelling the climate crisis: why LNG is no miracle cure for Australia coal addiction Coleman and Woodside chairman, Richard Goyder, were asked if the company had evidence to support its claim its gas was reducing global emissions by displacing coal use in Asia. Coleman said the company did not collect that information from customers, and pointed to a study that compared the life-cycle emissions from different forms of energy . Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said Australian oil and gas companies were clearly at risk of falling behind their European counterparts, such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell, in planning to diversify their business and set robust targets in line with the Paris agreement. “Investors expect the companies they invest in to address their contribution to rising global emissions,” she said. “It is incumbent now on Woodside to work constructively with the investors to develop real plans to transition to a net zero emissions company by",643

The children, including the Swedish environmental activist, lodged a legal case with the UN committee on the rights of the child against Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey last September. They alleged that the countries – which are legally obliged to protect children under the UN convention on the rights of the child – breached those obligations by failing to protect them from the “direct, imminent and foreseeable risk to their health and wellbeing” posed by the climate crisis. Three countries – Brazil, France and Germany – have replied to the petition, saying it should not be admissible by the committee. But on Tuesday the children hit back, arguing that the countries should be judged by their behaviour on the climate crisis. They said the three countries were all failing to cut their emissions in line with the Paris agreement . Sign up to the Green Light email to get the planet most important stories In response to the objections raised by Brazil , France and Germany, the children said they had been “directly and foreseeably injured” by the greenhouse gas emissions that those governments had allowed to change the climate. They have submitted new scientific research on how the countries are failing in their obligations, and said it would be “futile” to argue their case in separate domestic lawsuits in each country, as that “would not provide the type of far-reaching international relief needed to reverse climate change”. Although countries, excluding the US, have ratified the UN convention on the rights of the child , only governments have adopted a protocol that allows for this kind of legal action . Of those, the five biggest greenhouse gas emitters – Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey – are targeted in the lawsuit, which has been brought by the children with the backing of the green campaigning group Earthjustice and the international law firm Hausfeld. There has been no decision yet from the UN committee on whether to hear the legal complaint. The lawsuit joins a growing number of attempts to bring climate cases to court, alleging that government or businesses have flouted the law or failed in their international obligations. One of the most successful has been in the Netherlands, in the Urgenda case , in which judges found the government must change its policies to tackle emissions and the climate crisis. In the UK, campaigners brought a successful legal challenge that found the government was wrong to allow the expansion of Heathrow airport without taking into account its obligations under the Paris agreement. The ruling will have implications for other government plans likely to raise emissions, such as road-building schemes . More than legal actions have been brought around the world to try to force governments to confront the climate crisis. More than are in the US; the highest profile case there, the Juliana case, was dismissed by judges earlier this year . There are similar cases ongoing in countries including Ireland, Australia, Spain and New Zealand.",534
45,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/microplastics-found-in-greater-quantities-than-ever-before-on-seabed-currents-hotspots,"Scientists have discovered microplastics in greater quantities than ever before on the seabed, and gathered clues as to how ocean currents and deep-sea circulation have carried them there. Microplastics – tiny pieces of plastic less than in size – are likely to accumulate most densely on the ocean floor in areas that are also biodiversity hotspots, intensifying the damage they may do to marine ecosystems, according to the research. The international research team found up to pieces in a thin layer near the seafloor covering just sq metre. The discovery suggests that deep-sea currents act as conveyor belts that concentrate microplastics in hotspots, similar to the “garbage patches” visible on the surface in parts of the Pacific. Those same hotspots are also key breeding grounds for marine life, such as filter-feeding ascidians, or “sea squirts”, which are particularly prone to microplastic ingestion, along with sponges and cold water corals. Polychaetes, or “bristle worms”, live within the upper layers of sediment and actively mine it, and so can ingest buried microplastics that are decades old, showing that even when the pollutants fall to the seafloor they are not out of harm way and still have an impact on key ecosystems. These biodiversity hotspots are also home to various fish species. Dr Ian Kane, of the University of Manchester, was lead author of the study published in the journal Science . He said fragile ecosystems fed on nutrients and oxygenated water brought by the same ocean currents that carried microplastics. “The real problem is plastics that are sat around in the environment [which] can accumulate various pollutants and toxins on their surfaces,” he said. “There evidence that some of these toxins may be released when in the guts of organisms, and then you have the effect of the food chain, whereby small creatures are eaten by bigger creatures, and eventually you get to our fish stocks and you’re eating a nice piece of tuna containing decades-old microplastics contaminated with all sorts of nastiness.” Little research has been done so far on the impacts of microplastics on marine life , but there have been some concerning findings. For instance, a recent study found hermit crabs exposed to microplastics seemed less able to select new shells to live in . Most of the microplastic found in the study came not from the breakdown of larger pieces of plastic material, which previous thinking has suggested as the leading source of microplastics , but from textiles and clothing . That is an important finding, according to Kane, as it shows that much more can be done to prevent these tiny particles making it into the sea in the first place. “We can all make a difference by choosing not to buy fast fashion, which has a short shelf life in the shops and in our wardrobes, or by choosing to avoid plastic packaging and so on,” he said. The most powerful interventions, however, would need to come from the government and waste and water treatment industries , such as using filtration to prevent microplastics reaching the sea in the first place, Kane said. “These filters exist, for example graphene filters developed at the University of Manchester and new nanocellulose filter developed in Finland … But it really at the governmental policy level that these need to be implemented.” Jacqueline Savitz, from the conservation group Oceana, said: “This study shows why estimates of plastic pollution that have focused only on what is observed at the surface so severely underestimate the problem. “This relationship between microplastics hotspots and biodiversity hotspots compels us to act to turn off the plastic production faucet – it shows that cleanups will never suffice and that recycling has done little to address the problem. Sadly, the petrochemical industry is doing just the opposite, and it will fall on policymakers to stem the flow of plastics into our oceans.” The team consisted of researchers from the universities of Manchester and Durham, the National Oceanography Centre, the University of Bremen in Germany and Ifremer in France. They collected sediment samples from the seafloor of the Tyrrhenian Sea in the Mediterranean west of Italy, and examined them in conjunction with calibrated models of deep ocean currents and detailed mapping of the seafloor. In the laboratory, the microplastics were separated from sediment, counted under the microscope, and analysed using infra-red spectroscopy to determine the plastic types. The area of sea examined is also host to key fisheries, such as bluefin tuna, swordfish and grouper.",747

But now researchers have found that exposure to microplastics disrupts this key behaviour. The finds are the latest to suggest such pollution could be having an impact on the world marine creatures. “Usually a so-called ‘normal’ hermit crab will always want to go for the better shell,” said Dr Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen University Belfast, adding such shells are typically those of sea snails. “The striking thing in this study was when [we offered them a better shell], lots of the crabs that had been exposed to the microplastics didn’t make the optimal decision to take [it],” he said. Microplastics – pieces of plastic or smaller – are a growing subject of research, with previous studies showing they are present even in the depths of the ocean and are ending up in the bodies of living organisms, from seals to crabs and seabirds. However, while there is some evidence that exposure to such pollution has affected growth and reproduction in some animals, research into specific effects on animal behaviour and cognition remains scarce. Microplastics found in every marine mammal surveyed in UK study Arnott and his colleagues placed female hermit crabs in a tank containing seawater, seaweed and polyethylene beads, at a concentration akin to levels found in the environment. Another female hermit crabs were placed in a similar tank, but without the polyethylene beads. Writing in the journal Biology Letters , the team report how they kept each group in the tanks for five days, before removing each crab from its shell and giving it a new shell – crucially, these shells were about half the ideal weight for each crab. After two hours in their new shell, each crab was then put into a deep dish of seawater and the team presented it with another shell, this time of an ideal weight. 'Pieces of human society': deep ocean may be riddled with microplastics The team found that of the crabs who had not been exposed to the microplastics explored the optimal-sized shells, with of the crabs – – taking up residence in them. By contrast, crabs that had been exposed to microplastics took longer to begin such exploration and far fewer did so: just made contact with the optimal-sized shells and only nine – of the group – moved home. This suggests exposure to microplastics affects the shell selection behaviour of hermit crabs, the team say, indicating that pollution could be affecting cognition. “This shell selection behaviour is an example of a cognitive process – the animal has to gather information about the shell and it has to then decide how it is going to use that information,” said Arnott, adding that he was surprised by the results. However, the team say there is more to be done, including looking at whether different types of microplastic have a similar effect, exploring whether the microplastics actually enter the crab, and unpicking the mechanism for the effect. “We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behaviour, for example,” Arnott said. He added that the study only looked at hermit crabs, and it will be important to explore whether the behavioural changes observed in the laboratory are seen in the wild and have real-world implications. “Based on the striking finding [in this study] this would suggest that there could be a long-term impact in the natural world, but we need to do more work on that,” he said.",620
47,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/23/toxic-air-over-london-falls-by-50-at-busiest-traffic-spots,"London has had dramatic improvements in its air quality since the coronavirus lockdown, with dangerous emissions at some of the capital busiest roads and junctions falling by almost Figures released by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan , show that anti-pollution measures introduced from had already led to a drop across the capital of the harmful gas nitrogen dioxide, NO – rising to a reduction inside central London ultra-low emissions zone (ULEZ). In the last four weeks of lockdown there have been further big reductions, with NO falling by a further across London, and by almost half at some of the worst pollution hotspots. Khan welcomed the decline in toxic air, but said that once the lockdown was over it was essential that the efforts to improve London toxic air continued. “This cleaner air should not just be temporary. So once the current emergency has passed and we start to recover, our challenge will be to eradicate air pollution permanently and ensure the gains we’ve made through policies such as ULEZ continue.” Although the figures show a big reduction in NO , particulate pollution, which comes largely from domestic wood burning and agriculture, and which is very harmful to human health, remains a severe threat in London. Elizabeth Fonseca, an air quality expert at the Environmental Defence Fund Europe, said that long-term cleaner air was essential to protect people health. “Nitrogen dioxide pollution has gone down, but London recently saw huge spikes in dangerous particulate pollution. A few weeks’ or months’ improvement of just one pollutant doesn’t make lung disease and other ailments disappear.” There is mounting evidence of detrimental health impacts of air pollution, through lung disease, heart attacks, asthma, effects on pregnancies and on intelligence levels. Research published on Monday also found that the five most polluted regions among analysed in Italy, Spain, France and Germany accounted for of all reported deaths in those areas. Another study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher death rates . In the UK NO has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last years. A key policy to reduce levels involves clean air zones – such as the ultra-low emissions zone in London – where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the coronavirus crisis has seen some councils delay the planned introduction of clean air zones . Many cities across Europe , and some in the UK , have begun to unveil ambitious cycling and walking schemes to ensure people can move around safely and maintain the environmental benefits, in terms of cleaner air and safer streets, that have come about amid the lockdown. Gary Fuller, an air pollution expert at King College London, welcomed Thursday figures and said the policies introduced in London and elsewhere proved air pollution could be tackled. He said: “Breathing bad air has had an intolerable impact of Londoners’ health for far too long … but even before the Covid lockdown, London air pollution was undergoing a dramatic change for the better. “Nitrogen dioxide in central London and along main bus routes was improving at some of the fastest rates we’ve ever measured. We need to remember these lessons going forward. These successes show that our city air pollution is not an intractable problem and that actions can bring results.” Prof Stephen Holgate, an adviser on air quality at the Royal College of Physicians, said that although had wreaked havoc, the “dreadful virus has brought the importance of outdoor space and the environment into focus”. He added: “We’re all looking forward to the time when the lockdown is lifted, and once it does I sincerely hope we’ll be able to retain some of the new cleaner and greener habits we’ve developed.”",644
48,environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/deepwater-horizon-10-years-later-could-it-happen-again,"massive deepwater oil spill is nearly as likely today as it was in experts warn, years after the disastrous explosion of BP rig in the Gulf of Mexico that caused an environmental catastrophe. The blowout killed workers and spewed barrels of petroleum into the ocean for days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism. But experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill. Frances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill. ‘We’ve been abandoned’: a decade later, Deepwater Horizon still haunts Mexico “Disasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you’re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,” she said. “There are a lot of things that can go wrong.” Frances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries. “Of course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was years prior,” Beinecke said. Richard Sears, the commission senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but “there are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deep water”. “Everybody has to stay vigilant,” Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but the government could do more to limit industry risk. Outside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization. In the wake of the BP disaster, the US interior department restructured in an effort to allow a new division of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling. The Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP Deepwater Horizon rig. Now Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors . Trump has pushed an agenda of “energy dominance”, which critics say encourages industry to take risks. A constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US – more than acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico. His officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE director repeatedly calling them “partners”. “BSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,” the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August Internal emails suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns. Staffers at BSEE who spoke anonymously to E&amp;E News depict a “broken” agency run by Angelle, who is a former Louisiana politician and longtime supporter of the Gulf oil industry. “BSEE is focused on ensuring energy development is conducted in a safe and smart manner,” a spokesman, Sandy Day, told the Guardian, maintaining that the industry was vastly different from what it was years ago. “BSEE is committed to its mission to promote safety, protect the environment and conserve offshore resources through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement,” said Day, adding: “Safety is a top priority for the Trump administration oversight of OCS [outer continental shelf] operations, and BSEE has significantly increased safety performance in comparison to the Obama administration through increased inspections and more effective use of data.” Meanwhile, drillers have moved farther and deeper offshore, pursuing wells with enough oil to produce for decades, known in the industry as “elephants”. Low oil prices – from a boom in production on land following the discovery of fracking – haven’t kept them out of the water. Most of the in leases sold by the US in the Gulf last month were in deep water . “Offshore drilling is going after bigger and bigger wells that have more and more oil,” said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-wrote a book on the BP disaster. “These are being drilled in deep water and they’re being drilled in high pressure wells that are harder to control. And they’re being drilled in more complex geology.” One study found that for every deeper a well is drilled, documented incidents increase . The Deepwater Horizon rig reached about or close to a mile, down. Other platforms still operating in the Gulf are as deep or deeper. One drilled in called “Blind Faith”, is still producing, according to documents from Chevron. It reaches to the Gulf floor. Deans called the current regulatory approach “an honor system” that “smacks of exactly the kind of self-enforcement that the independent commission found to be a fatal flaw” in the BP blowout. “Definitely, it could happen again,” he said. “You cannot make these operations safe. All you can do is try to reduce the risk.” Smaller-scale incidents that don’t make the news occur frequently in the Gulf. Between and there were an average of fires and explosions in federal waters annually, about one every three days, according to government data reviewed by the environment campaign Oceana . There were also nearly fatalities over that time. Donald Boesch, a biological oceanographer and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, who was also on the commission, said Trump changes have undermined offshore safety. “Many steps have been taken by both government and industry since the accident years ago … I felt comfortable – not that the risk was reduced to negligible – but that we were in better shape now than we were,” Boesch said. “I’ve frankly been made more concerned about how the safety issues are being treated under the Trump administration.” Still, sources familiar with industry say the big companies learned a lesson as they watched BP suffer huge reputational damage and pay for its mistakes. Wesley Williams, a petroleum engineering professor at Louisiana State University, who was awarded a nearly research grant from a fund BP was forced to pay into, said the “real motivator” for industry was “the image issue that happened and the financial cost of what happened to BP”. 'I pray to God it never happens again': US gulf coast bears scars of historic oil spill years on “From the large operators, I’ve seen a big change in safety culture,” Williams said. But the sector consists of more than just the brands most people can identify, like BP, Shell and Exxon. Those companies work with large networks of contractors, and smaller independent operators are active in the Gulf of Mexico too. Williams said they did not always have the resources for extensive safety training. John Amos, president of SkyTruth, a not-for-profit conservation technology organization, said: “The next major oil spill, when it happens, will catch us off guard … like every previous one has, unless we decide that this time it going to be different,” Amos said.",1306
